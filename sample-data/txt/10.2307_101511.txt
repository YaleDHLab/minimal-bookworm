Some Inquiries and Directions concerning Tides, proposed by Dr. Wallis, for the proving or disproving of his lately publish't Discourse concerning them. The Inquisitive Dr. Wallis, having in his lately printed Hypothesis of Tides intimated, that he had reason to believe, that the Annual Spring tides happen to be rather about the beginnings of Febr. and Nov. than the two AEquinoxes, doth in a late Letter to the Publisher, written from Oxford in Aug. last, desire, Sea some understanding Persons at London, or Greenwich,but rather nearer the that or upon the Sea-shore, would make particular Observation of all the Spring-Tides (New-Moon and Full-Moon) between this and the End of November; and take account of the Hour,and of the Perpendicular height: that we may see, whether those in September, or those of November be highest: And it were not amiss, the Low waters were observed too. Which may be easily done by a mark made upon any standing Post in the Water, by any R 2 Water(298) Water-man, or other understanding Person, who dwells by the Waterside. It would also deserve (thinks he) to be inquired into, whether, when the Tides be highest, the Ebbs be ever lowest, & contra; (which is generally affirmed, and almost put out of question) or rather (which sutes best with his Hypothesis) whether, when the Tides are highest, both in the Annual and Menstrual Periods, the Low waters be not allo highest; and at Neap-Tides, the Ebbes also very low. He adds, that he should expect, that the Spring-Tides now coming, and those at the beginning of September, should not be so high, as those at the middle of September; and then lower again at the beginning of October, and after that, higher at the middle of October, and higher yet about the beginning of November (at the usual times of Spring-tides after the New and Full.)
