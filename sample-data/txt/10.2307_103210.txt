XXXVI. An Extract of a Letter from Francis Nevill, Esq; to the Lord Bishop of Clogher, F. R. S. concerning a Quarry of Marble discover'd by him in the County of Farmanagh in Ireland. Belturbet, October 14. 1712. My Lord, MR. Cole and I were lately in the Mountains, where I had discovered a Marble Quarry. The Country wherein it lyes is so strange for the Natural Wonders in it, that 'twould make a little History to describe all that is to be seen. It lies on the Northside of Calcagh, in the Parish Kilasher, and County of Femanagh. There are Marble Rocks, whose Perpendicular (279) cular Height is fifty or sixty Feet, discovered by Subterraneous Rivers, which, by degrees, have wash'd away the Earth and loose Stones, and discovered these mighty Rocks, There are many great Pits fallen in on the sides of the great Mountain; several of them in a small Compass of Ground, so that it is dangerous travelling near them. There are many Caves form'd, some very large, the Sides and Arches of Marble; some of a Liver-colour, varied with white in many little Figures; some of a light Blue varied with White; but I could find no entire White or Black among them.
