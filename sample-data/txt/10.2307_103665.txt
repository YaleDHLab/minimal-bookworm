V. A Letter from the Reverend Mr. Edmund Barrel, Rector of Sutton near Dartford in Kent, to Sir Hans Sloane, Baronet, concerning a Shock of an Earthquake felt in that Neighbourhood, &c. S I R, Sutton, Aug. 11th, 1727. I had an Information brought to me Yesterday, on purpose to be communicated to your Society; 'twas, that the Earthquake was felt very sensibly at a Farm on a Hill called Skeat-Hill, which is at the West End of Lullingstone-Park, belonging to Percival Hart, Esq; (306) Esq; about 8 Miles South-West from Dartford: And the same Morning a Piece of Ground, in a Meadow in Farningham, about five Miles South of Dartford, fell in, so as leave a Pit about 8 or 10 Feet over and near as deep; and being on the same level with the River, it was (when seen that Morning) fill'd with Water, within 3 or 4 feet of the Top; tho' that Spot of Ground, was supposed to have been as sound as any about it, Carts having many times gone over that very place.
