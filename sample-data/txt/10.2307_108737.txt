r 277 ] XIV. A Seventh Miemoir on Quantics. By ARTHUR CAYLEY, Esq., F.R.S. Received February 28,-Read March 14, 1861. THE present memoir relates chiefly to the theory of ternary cubics. Since the date of my Third MiN/emoir on Quantics, M. ARONI-IOLD has published the continuation of his researches on ternary cubies, in the memoir "1 Theorie der homogenen Functionen dritten Grades von drei Veraiiderlichen," Crelle, t. lv. pp. 97-191 (18,58). He there considers two derived contravariants, linear functions of the fundamental ones, and which occupy therein the position which the fundamental contravariants PU, QU do in my Third Memoir; in the notation of the present memoir these derived contravariants are YU= "'3T. PU-4S. QU, ZU=-48S2.PU+T. QU; and for the canonical form 3 +y3+z3+ 61xyz, they acquire respectively the factor (1 + 81/)', viz. in this case YU = (1+813)2{ 1 (f+8+43)3F} ZU = (I+ 813)24(1+23)(03+43+43)+ 1812ut4; The derived contravariants have with the covariants U, HU, even a more intimate connexion than have the contravarialnts PU, QU; and the advantage of the employment of YU, ZU fully appears by M. ARONHOLD'S memoir. But the conclusion is, not that the contravariants PU, QU are to be rejected, but that the system is to be completed by the addition thereto of two derived covariants, linear functions of U, HU; these derived covariants, suggested to me by M. ARoNHOLD'S memoir, are in the present memoir called CU, DU; their values are CU -T.U+24S.HU DU= 8S2.U-3T. HU: and for the canonical form X3+y3 +zz3 + v6lyz, they acquire respectively, not indeed (1+813)2, but the simple power (1+813 ), as a factor, viz. in this case CU=(1+813){ (-..1+413)(X3+f3+Z3)+ 18lxyz} DU=(1+813){12( 5+413)(X3+y3+z3)+3(1-1013)xyz}; it was in fact by means of this condition as to the factor (1+813), that the foregoing expressions for CU, DU were obtained*. * M. AnoNHOLD, in a letter dated Berlin, 17 June 1861, has pointed out to me that the covariants CU' DU are in his notation Psf PTf, and that they belong to the forms called Conjugate Forms, ? 27 of his memoir. But the explicit development of the properties of these covariants is not on this account thfe less interesting. Added 20 Sept. 1861.-A. C. 278 MTR. A. CAYLEY'S SEVENTH MEMOIR ON QUANTICS. The formulae of my Third Memoir and those of M. ARONHOLD are by this means brought into harmony and made parts of a whole; instead of the two intermediates ocU+6P3HU, 6aPU+f3QU, in Tables 68 and 69 of my Third Memoir, or of the intermediates aU+6P3HU, -2aYU+2P3ZU, of M. ARONHOLD'S theory, we have the four intermediates aU+63lHU, -2aYU+2fZU, 2acCU2fDU, 6&,PU+t3QU, in Tables 74, 75, 76, and 77 of the present memoir. These four Tables embrace the former results, and the new ones which relate to the covariants CU, DU; and they are what is most important in the present memoir. I have, however, excluded from the Tables, and I do not in the memoir consider (otherwise than incidentally) the covariant of the sixth order ?U, or the contravariant (reciprocant) FU. I have given in the memoir a comparison of my notation with that of M. ARONROiLD. A short part of the memoir relates to the binary cubic and the binary quartic, viz. each of these quantics has a covariant of its own order, forming with it an intermediate %U+i3W, the covariants whereof contain quantics in (a, ), the coefficients of which are invariants of the original quantic. The formula which relate to these cases are in fact given in my Fifth Memoir, but they are reproduced here in order to show the relations between the quantics in (b, P3) contained in the formula. As regards the binary quartic, these results are required for the discussion of the like question in regard to the ternary cubic, viz, that of finding the relations between the different qualities in (a, A) contained in the formula relating to the ternary cubic. Some of these relations have been obtained by M. HERMITE in the memoir " Sur les formes cubiques a trois iude'terminees," (Liouville, t. iii. pp. 37-40 (1858), and in that " Sur la Resolution des equations du quatrie'me degre," Comptes Rendus, xlvi. p. 715 (1858), and by M. ARONHOLD in his memoir already referred to; and in particular I reproduce and demonstrate some of the results in the last-mentioned memoir of M. HERMITE. But the relations in question are in the present memoir exhibited in a more complete and systematic form. The paragraphs and Tables of the present memoir are numbered consecutively with those of my former memoirs on Quantics. 231. For the binary cubic (a, b, c, d3?x, y)3, if U be the cubic itself, IU the Hessian, (PU the cubicovariant, and El the discriminant (see Fifth Memoir, Nos. 115, 118), then Covariant and other Tables, INo. 71.

Writing for the moment G=(1, 0, -91, -54Jm, 03)3, then the Hessian, cubicovariant, and discriminant of this cubic function of (ce, 1) are respectively HG= 3(1, 18J, 3121Xo, j)2, (DG= 54(J, J2, 9IJ -I3 +54J2ja, I3)3 O G= -108 0; so that the covariants of the intermediate `U+6OHU are all of them expressible by means of the cubic function G. It may be noticed that G is what the left-hand side of the equation 4(HU)3-4I. HU. U2+JU3=-((DU))2 (see Fifth Memoir, No. 128) becomes on writing therein a, -61, for U, HU respectively, and throwing out the factor 4. 234. I take the opportunity of remarking with respect to a binary quartic U =(a, b, c, dxx, y)4, that the Hessian of the cubicovariant, to fix the numerical factor, say X{8(PU .(U-(bxa,, DU)2}, is =2U2_36J.U.HU+121(HU)2, which is Wi~~~~~~~8 2l~ 1S (IUI HU) + II(13 27j2)(HU)2; or if 1327J2= 0, that is if the quartic has a pair of equal factors, the Hessian of the cubicov7ariant is a perfect square, 235. Coming now to the ternary cubic U= (a, b, c, f, g, h, i, j, kc, 1~ y, Z)3, I gi .Ve in the first place the following comparison of my notation with that of M. ARONHOLD. * The coefficients 2916J2 is in the Fifth Memnoii erroneously g~iven as ~29I6fJ2 280 MI. A. CAYLEY'S SEVENTH MIEMOIR ON1Or QUJANTICS.

ARONHOLD'S Pf, Qf) and the notations CU, DU are first employed in the present memoir. I remark in regard to P(=-2YU), wheire, as already mentioned, YU =:(1 + 813)2 { 1(i3+43+ 03) 3}n! that in my Memoir on Curves of the Third Order*, I was led incidentally to the curve 1(g3 + 3 +43)_ 3,S0 and that I there gave the equation 3T. PU 4S. QUIJ(I + 813)3{l(V3-+H3+ 3)30} But the curve (1+2la(38+<)lleCo Jjhich corresponds to (Qf=2ZU), does not occur in that memoir. 236. 1 remark, further, in regard to M. ARONHOLD'S 0,1 H, that these are what he calls "Zwischenformen" viz. they are covariants of the cubic and of the adjoint linear form ,x-jy+ +z, or as they might be termed Contracovariants. For the canonical form TJ=tx'+y3+ z3+G61yz, the value of i0 is (yz -?S z_ 112 27 . 12Z2, 12zyz _ ,2 12zx _y2, 12 y Z2, Y which is a form which occurs incidentally in my memoir last referred to (see p. 427). The value of H in the same case is (-2 1(11) 2 -6iyz, . 7 . , -(1+41)x2+21(1+213)yz . , , , which does net occur in that memoir. In my Third Memoir on Quant-es I purposely abstained fromt the consideration of any sulch forms. 237. My covaria'nts OU and 01U involved unsymmetrically thecubic and its Hessian,* PIhilo ophical Transactions, t. cxlvii. (1857) see p. 427. MIR. A. CAYLEY'S SEVENTH AMEMOIR ON QUANTICS. 281 and it did not occur to me how a similar covariant, such as M. ARONHOLD'S 4A, which involves the two functions symmetrically, was to be formed. Let (A, B, C) be the first derived functions, (a, b, c, f g, h) the second derived functions of the cubic U, and (A', B', C') the first derived functions, (a', b6, c', f', g', A') the second derived functions of the Hessian HU, then disregarding numerical factors, we have U = (bc f2, .. gh -af,.. IA', B', C1)2, ?,U =(b'c'f'2, . . g'h'af', .K. A, B, C )2 and A_=(bc'+b'c-2ff', . . gh'+g'h-af '-af, . . )A, B, CX(A', B', C'); and considering U=O as the equation of a curve of the third order, the equations ?U= 0 ?,U= 0, 0=O have the following significations, viz. ?U=0 is the locus of a point, such that its second or line polar with respect to the Hessian touches its first or conic polar with respect to the cubic: 0,U is the locus of a point such that its second or line polar with respect to the cubic touches its first or conic polar with respect to the Hessian: and , =0 is the locus of a point such that its second or line polar with respect to the cubic, and its second or line polar with respect to the Hessian are reciprocals (that is, each passes through the pole of the other of them) with respect to the conic which is the envelope of a line cutting the first or conic polar of the point with respect to the cubic, and the first or conic polar of the point with respect to the Hessian in two pairs of points which are harmonically related to each other: such being in fact the immediate interpretation of the analytical formula. But this in passing. 238. The formulae (Tables 68 and 69 of my Third Memoir) for the discriminants of the intermediates aU+6PHU and 6cmPU+I3QU respectively are IR( osU +61311U)[(1, 0, -24S, ST , -48S2 5 r)nT3R, R(6aPU+ f3QU)=[(48S, 8T, -96S2, -24TS, -.T2_ 16SXJa, P3)4]3R. In M. HERMITE'S paper in the ' Comptes Rendus,' already referred to, there are given between these quantics in (ce, (3) certain relations which (although less simple than the relations that will afterwards be obtained) I now proceed to investigate. Putting in the first formula az *.3 =p, and in the second formula a .-3= 0, wehave R(pU +6HU)=O, if (1, 0, -24S, 8T, 48S2 Qp, 1)4=0, R(6dPU+ QU)=0 1if (48S, 8T, -96S2, -24TS, -T2-16S3 A, )4-O which equations ink pI, are about to be considered in place of the quantics from which they respectively arise. 239. It is convenient to write* A=4S, B =\/T2 64S3 * A is (AnoNHOLD' s and) HEIERMITE'S S, B is IEREMITE'S S1, and p, q, 0, A are HERMITE's a, 1, -A, d: there is a slight inaccuracy in three of his formulhe, which should be 2 S (T , 82\ 24S 24S2 corresponding to formulhe in the present memoir. M DcccLxI.2 282 MAR. A. CAYLEY'S SEVENTH MEMOIR ON QUANTICS. (so that T2=A3+B3 and, for the canonical form, A=-41+ 413, B=1 + 813). Making this change, and joining to the equation inp that derived from it by writing q for p, and interchanging A, B, we have the three equations (1, 0, -GA, -ST ,-3A2 Up, 1)4=0, (1 0,? -6B, -ST, 3B2 B ) =)=0, (12A, ST, -6A2 -6TA, _T TA3, )-. 240. The signification of the equation in q is as follows, viz. if the quantic U=(*(X y, z)3 is transformed into the canonical form X3+Y3+Z3+61XYZ by means of the linear equations (S. y, z) =(AIX, Y, Z), where A is a matrix, then using the same letter A to represent the determinant formed out of this matrix, or determinant of substitution, we have 3 so that the equation in q is one that presents itself in the question of the reduction of the cubic to its canonical form. In fact the linear transformation gives SA4=-1+14, TA6= 1-2013816 and thence (T2_ 64S3)A'2= (1 + 813)3 which, writing B3 in the place of T264S3, becomes B3A12= (1 + 813)3, or B A4 = 1+8P , or 813=BA -1, whence also 8TA6= 8-20(BA -l)-(BA4-l)2 =27-18 BA4 -B2As7 or, as this may be written, 81 54B 24T 3 which, putting therein q t2, v becomes (l, 0, -6B, -8T, -3B 2JqJ 1)4= 0 the above-mentioned equation in q. 241. The relation between 0 and q is d--0= '2 MIR. A. CAYLEY'S SEVENTH MEMOIR ON QUANTICS. 283 as may be verified without difficulty. That between 0 and p is 4 (P P as appears by the identical equation (12A, 8T, -6A2, -6TA, -T -2_kAl A(p +p), 1 )4 64p4 (3A, 8T, -12A, -72TA, -46A364T2, -72TA2, -12A4, 8TA2, 3A5 p, )8 __34lp4(l, 0, -6A,I-8T, -3A21p, 1)4.(3A, 8T, 6A2, 0, -A3p, 1)4, where the second factor of the product on the right-hand side is p4 A _P (1, 0. -6A' -8T, -3A 21 p 1)4. The relation between p and q is then at once found to be 2B2 A A 2T5 Pp + or (sincep, q and A, B may be simultaneously interchanged) 2A2 B 2T qq B 242. Let the equations in p, q be represented by pp=O, +qO respectively; then we have pp=p4-6Ap28p3A, and therefore p @pz8p3Ap -2T, whence 4 p~ppp4_ 3A22Ty 3Ap2+ 6Up+ 3A2, and therefore 2B2p 24B2 with a like formula forp, that is we have 24B2 24A2 q= wp= w which with the equation d4 (pp), are the system of equations connecting 0, p, q. 243. As already remarked, we have to consider the two derived covariants, CU=-T.U+24S .HU, DU= 8S2 .U3T .HU, 2 Q2 284 MR. A. CAYLEY'S SEVENTH MEMOIR ON QUANTICS. and the two derived contravariants, YUI= 3T.PU-4S.0QU, ZU=-48S2.PU+ T.0QU, which for the canonical form x?+y'+z3 +61byz are as follows:Table No. 70 (addition to).

It will be convenient, before giving the Tables for the covariants of aU+6tHU, 2aCU-23DU, 6aPU+PQU, 2aYU-2j3ZU, which replace Tables 68 and 69 of my Third Memoir, to give the following separate Table of the quantics in (a, 3) which enter into the expressions of the invariants in Tables 68 and 69, and in these new Tables.

The quantics in (oa, P3) contained in the foregoing Table are in the sequel indicated by means of their leading coefficients; as thus, (1, 0, -24S, ., .3(, P04) (So T~. ..

Thus, in the formation of Table 74, Table 68 gives &U+6P3HU and H(aU+6f3HU), and from these C(caU+6 3HU). D(czU + 611HU) have to be found: the same Table gives also P(acU + 63PHU), Q(cU+6T(HU), but the expressions of these quantities YU, ZU have to be intro286 MR. A. CAYLEY'S SEVENTH MEMOIR ON QUANTICS. duced in the place of PU, QU; and from the expressions so transformed are deduced ,dlso the expressions for Y(acU+ 6PHU), Z(caU+63HU). Table 75 is to be deduced from Table 69 by writing therein (e', /') for (ac, 3), and then putting 6'PU+/'QU =2aYU-2f3ZU, which, as is seen above, gives x', P'as functions of oa, / and of th-e imvariants S and T; but in some of the formula, YU, ZU, have to be introduced in the place of PU, QU. And so for the Tables 76 and 77. The actual effectuation of the transformations would, it is almost needless to remark, be very laborious, but the forms of the results are easily foreseen, and the results can then be verified by means of one or two coefficients only.

It will be noticed how Tables 74 and 75 form a system involving only the quantics in (a, [) contained in the first part of Table 73, and how, in like manner' Tables 76 and 77 form a system involving only the quantics in (a, [) contained in the second part of Table 73; and, moreover, how in each pair of Tables the covariants, &c. correspond to each other as follows, viz.R, S, T, 11 H, C, D, P, Q, Y, Z to S, R, T, Y. PI Z. Q, HI D, 1, C. Thus in Table 74,-the formula for H(a7U + 63H1U), and in Table 75,-the formula for P (2aYU-2jZU), each of them involve the same factor f ,aA1, 0 24S,..oa, 04.

In fact, considering the function (1, 0, -248, .S . [)4 which for shortness I call G, we have G= (1, 0,-24S, . .o, [3)4, IG00 JG = 4(64S -T 2) = 4R, cG= G (IG)3 -27(JG)2=-432R2-, HIG-4(S, T., ..a I?

The expression for 1H1(XG++6UHG), putting therein 4=0, shows that, to a numerical factor pre's, H. HG is equal to G, and hence, disregarding numerical factors, we may say that each of the quartics (1, 0, 24S, ..lXa /)4, (8, T, .. Xa, [)4, is the Hessian of the other of them, and that the sextic (T, 96S2, . [3)6 is the cubicovariant of each of them. MR. A. CAYLEY'S SEYENTH MEMOIR ON QUANTICS. 291 249. Similarly, if the function (48S, 8T, . .

The expression for H(XG+6pHG), putting therein = 0, shows that, to a numerical factor pres, H . HG is equal to G; so that, disregarding numerical factors, we may say that each of the quartics (48S, T, .. a, P3)4, (T2+192S3, . *, /P)4, is the Hessian of the other of them, and that the sextic (8T3+4608TS3, .. a PY)6 is the cubicovariant of each of them. 250. But besides this, the quantics in (a, O) in the two parts of the Table 73 are linearly connected together: the linear relations in question are in fact the equations whereon depend the expressions for the invariants in Tables 76 and 77 as deduced from those in Tables 74 and 75; and in the order of proof, they precede the formule in these four Tables. The linear relations are Table No. 80. (1, 0, -24S,.. X-2Tx--16S2/3, 8$oc+ Tr)4=-16R (T2+192S3,.. la /3)41 (S.

Xd 3)t which belong to the two parts respectively of Table 73, and which are related, the first of them to the -disc iminants of czU+ 6OHUU and 2&Y U2 jZU, and the second to the discriminants of 6ePU+PQU, -2aCU+2j3DU, have these relations to each other, Viz. each is a linear transformation of the Hessian of the other of them, and the cubicovariant of each is a linear transformation of the cubicova iant of the other.
