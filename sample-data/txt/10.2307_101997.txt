The Descriptions of certain Shells found in the East Indies, Communicated by Mr. Witzen to Dr. Lister, and by him to the Publisher, with some Remarks of his own. S I R, I Here sent you inclosed an Account of certain Shells and their Figures, which I received from Mr. Witzen, formerly Ambassadour here from the States of Holland, and (871) and also well known to the Learned World by his excellent Map of Tartary. Translated from the French. He Writes thus: ` There are found on the Coasts of Malabar and Cey` lon, certain Cockles or Shells in Dutch called Kouk-horens. ` These Shells contain a Fish that lives in the bottom of ` the Sea, fixt to the Body of the Shell, and at a certain ` Season of the Year, they cast their Seed which produ` ces a sort of Matrix of the size of the Figure *; this ` long Body which is wrinckled like an Andouille or Saus` age is filled with a great number of round Celles, which ` are so many Matrices, each producing its little shell` fish; which quit not their cells till they are grown to ` such a bigness and maturity, as their weight breaks them ` off and loosens them from their cells, and so from their ` common Matrix, which remains fastned to the bottom ` of the Sea by the great end, the other end moving a` bout freely in the water, which is flexible every way ` like an Andouille. This Matrix the Hollanders call ` Swambalk. Vid. Fig. 4. ` It is observable that this Matrix has a kind of back` part and Belly, the Back is something like that of a ` Sckelvis and of a greyish colour, the Belly is whiter, ` and is that part which is filled with the cellsfrom one ` end to the other: the Skin which covers it is very like ` that of Stock-fish or other dryed Fish. ` Figure the 5th, Is a shell found in the River of Goa, ` which holds a sort of Oyster. It is very scarce and ` in the Indies as well as here the shell powdered is esteem` ed a good Medicine. X x 2 S I R, (872) S I R, THis last Figure is of an Oister-shell, the like is to be found in the West indies, whether the same species I cannot determine, having never seen them intire together to compare them. But Sir, considering the hint that is here given us, of its being thought Medicinal at Goa where it is found; and also how that calcined Shells are the most common entertainment all over the Indies, chiewing them all day long with the Leaves of a certain hot piperate and spicy Plant and a sort of Nut mixt therewith: we may reasonably suspect the Goa Stone to be made up of them, or such like Ingredients.
