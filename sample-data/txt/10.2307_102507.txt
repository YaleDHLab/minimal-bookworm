(190) X. A Method of extracting the Root of an Infinite Equation. By A. De Moivre, F. R. S. Theorem. IF~ az+bzz+cz3+dz4+cz5+fz6, &c. = gy+hyy+iy3+ ky4+ly5+my6, &c. then will zbe= g/a y + h-bAA/a y2 + i-2bAB-cA3/a y3 + k-bBB-2bAC-3cAAB-dA4/a y4 + l 2bBC 2bAD 3cABB 3cAAC 4dA3B eA5/a y5 + m 2bBD bCC 2bAE cB3 6cABC 3cAAD 6dAABB 4dA3C 5eA4B fA6/a y6 &c. For the understanding of this Series, and in order to continue it as far as we please; it is to be observed, 1. That every Capital Letter is equal to the Coefficient of each preceding Term; thus the Letter B is equal to the Coefficient h-bAA./a 2. That the Denominator of each Coefficient is always a. 3. That the first Member of each Numerator, is always a Coefficient of the Series gy+byy+iy3, &c. viz. the First Numerator begins with the firstCoefficient g,the Second Numerator with the Second Co-efficient h,and so on. 4. That in every Member after the First,the Sum of the Exponents of theCapital Letters, is always equal to the Index of the Power to which this <inferred>Member</inferred> belongs: Thus considering the Coefficient k bBB 2bAC 3cAAB dA4,/a which belongs to the Power y4, we shall see that in every Member bBB, 2bAC 3CAAB, dA4, the Sum of the Exponents of the Capital Letters is 4, (where I must take notice, that by the Exponent of a (191) a Letter; I mean the Number which expresses what Place it has in the Alphabet; thus 4 is the Exponent of the Letter D) hence I derive this Rule for finding the Capital Letters of all the Members that belong to any Power; Combine the Capital Letters as often as you can make the Sum of their Exponents Equal to the Index of the Power to which they belong. 5. That the Exponents of the small Letters,which are written before theCapitals, express how many Capitals there is in each Member. 6. That the Numerical Figures or Unciae that occur in these Members, express the Number of Permutations which the Capital Letters of every Member are capable of. For the Demonstration of this; suppose z= Ay+ Byy+ Cy3 + Dy4, &c. Substitute this Series in the room of z, and the Powers of this Series, in the room of the Powers of z; there will arise a new Series; then take the Co-efficients which belong to the several Powers of y, in this new Series, and make them equal to the corresponding Co-efficients of the Series gy + hyy + iy3, &c. and the Co-efficients A, B, C, D, &c. will be found such as I have determined them. But if any one desires to be satisfied, that the Law by which the Co-efficients are form'd, will always hold, I'll desire 'em to have recourse to the Theorem I have given for raising an infinite Series to any Power, or extracting any Root of the same; for if they make use of it, for taking successively the Powers of Ay + Byy + Cy3, &c. they will see that it must of necessity be so. I might have made the Theorem I give here, much more general than it is; for I might have suppos'd, azm+ bzm+1 + czm+2 &c.= gym+ bym+1+ iym+2 &c. then all the Powers of the Series Ay+ Byy + Cy3, &c. design'd by the universal Indices, must have been taken successively; but those who will please to try this, my easily do it, by means of the Theorem for raising an infinite Series to any Power, &c. This Theorem may be applied to what is called the Reversion of Series, such as finding the Number from its Logarithm given; the Sine from the Arc; the Ordinate of an Ellipse from an Area given to be cut from any Point in the Axis: But to make a particular Application of it, I'll suppose we have this Problem to solve; viz. The Chord of an Are being (192) ing given, to find the Chord of another Arc, that shall be to the first as n to 1. Let y be the Chord given, z the Chord required; now the Arc belonging to the Chord y is, y + y 3/6dd + 3 y 5/40d4 + 5y7/112d6 &c. and the Arc belonging to the Chord z is z + z 3/6dd + 2z5/40d4 + 5 z 7/112d6 &c. the first of these Arcs is to the second as ` to n; therefore multiplying the Extreams and Means together, we shall have this Equation: z + z 3/6dd + 3z 5/40d4 + 5z 7/112d6 &c. = ny + n y 3/6 dd + 3ny 5/40d4 + 5ny7/112d6 &c. Compare these Two Series with the Two Series of the Theorem, and you will find a= 1, b= 0, c= 1/6dd, d= 0, e= 3/40d4 f= 0, &c. g= n, h= 0, i= n/6dd, k= 0, l= 3n/40d4, m= 0, &c. hence z will be = ny + n-n3/6dd y3 &c. or ny + 1-nn/2 x 3dd yyA, &c. Supposing A to denote the whole preceding Term, which will be the same Series as Mr. Newton has first found. By the same Method, this general Problem may be solv'd; the Abscisse corresponding to a certain Area in any Curve being given, to find the Abscisse, whose corresponding Area shall be to the first in a given Ratio. The Logarithmic Series might also be found without borrowing any other Idea, than that Logarithms are the Indices of Powers: Let the Number, whose Logarithm we inquire, be 1+z, suppose its Log. to be az+ bzz+ cz3, &c. Let there be another Number 1 + y; thereof its Logarithm will be ay+ byy+ cy3, &c. Now if 1+z=1+yn, it follows, that az + bzz + cz3 &c, ay + byy + cy3, &c:: n, 1. that is, az + bzz + cz3, &c. = nay + nbyy + ncy3, &c, Therfore (193) Therefore we may find a Value of z exprest by the Powers of y; again, since 1 + z = 1 + y n, therefore z= 1 + y n 1 that is z = ny + n/1 x n-1/2 yy + n/1 x n-1/2 x n-2/3 y3, &c. Therefore z is doubly exprest by the Powers of y. Compare these Two Values together, and the Co efficients a, b, c, &c. will be determin'd, except the first a which may be taken at Pleasure, and gives accordingly, all the different Species of Logarithms.
