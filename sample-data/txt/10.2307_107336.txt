R, S.; and the ingenuity which he displayed on that occasion has obtained the notice and called forth the praises of eminent mathematicians both in this island and on the Continent. Yet, while the great ingenuity of the device is thus generally and justly allowed, this method of rectifying the hyperbola has always appeared to me to be Mr HELLIN 0X the Retji lton,&c. It more curious than ulseful, as it Zs Ciritous, and requi red muac more alclat'on than i's requisitefor that purpose by an ppropri t the orem, The establishment of this truth is the main design of this short paper; a truth which, to my surprise, has not been noticed in any book that has come to my hands.* a. But, before I proceed to investigation, it seems proper to remark, that Mr. LAND-N has, in his Memoirt on the Hyperbola and Ellipsis, expressed nimse t if 1 e thought that the difference between an hyperbolic arch and Its tangent, when both are of an immense length, could not be computed before he published that work. His words at the beginning of the memoir above-mentioned, are these: "Some of the theorems "given by mathematicians for the calIulation of fluents by means of elliptic and hyperbolic arcs requiring, in the appli ;cation tUereof, the difference to be taken between an arc of "an hyperbola and its tangent and such dil ence being 'not directly attainable when such arc and its tangent both "become infinite, as they w<11 do when the whoe filuent is wanted, "although such fluent be at t1e same time fi te; "those theorems therefore 'n that case fil a computation "thereby be'ng then Wnpracficable without sonic9 ther "help. "The supplying that defect I considered as a point of some importance in geoi ry, and therefore I earnestly wish.ed and endeavoured to accomplish th.at business i my aim eing to ascertain, by means of suclM as a tion he limit of the dir ence between the hyperbolic are and its* On this occasion, no on h$as beotrayed more gn hown a greater want of candour, than the writer of Art.

The rxsuIt' of iny enldeavours respecting that point appears in this Mermoir: which, among other matters, contains the investiga"tion of a general theorem for finding the length of any arc " of any conic hyperbola by means of two elliptic arcs."Vol. I. p 23 and 24. And towards the end of the sanle memoir he has expressed himself thus: c; Mr. MACLAURIN 's method of construction," [of the elastic curve, "just now adverted to, though very elegant, is not without a defect. The difference between the hyperbolic arc and its tangent being necessary to be taken, " the method (for the reason mentioned at the beginning CC of this Memoir) always fails when some principal point in "the figure is to be determined ; the said arc and its tangent "then both becoming infinite, though their diffierence be at "the same time finite." P. 36. 3. Whoever reads the passages here quoted, and knows not what wvas done on the subject before Mr. LANDEN liandied it, will undoubtedly conceive that he was the first person who solved the problem of computiVg the djference between th e Aength of the infinite arch of an hyperbola and its asymp9tore. Yet the fact is not so. That difference may be computed, lin many cases, by the first series given by Mr. MACLAURIN in rAr. 8o8 of his Treatise of FIuxion s, which series admits of an easy transformation into another form, by which the aforesaid difference may be con puted in all cases; or the fluent inay be of the yperh oa.13 taken in a series which will always converge ; and both he and Mr. SImPsoN have actually pioduced such a series, the one in the place before referred to, and the other in Art435 of his Doctine of Flium7ons. And although this series, when the transverse axis of the hyperbola is much greater than the conjugate, will converge very slowly, yet (as I have shown in the Philosophical Transactions for the year 1798,) the value of it to, seven, or even to ten places of figures -is, in all cases, attainable. AS Mr. LANDEN 'had the character of a man of great probity, and as he has, in various parts of his writings, shewn a regard for the memory of the eminent mathematicians abovenmentioned, I cannot account for this misrepresentation of the matter any other way than by supposing that, being old when he wrote this memoir, and incumbered with much other business, his memory failed him. His just praise on thi's occasion is, that his solution of the aforesaid problem is much better than those of his contemporaries. I shall have occasion to speak again of this problem in my observations towards the end of this paper; but now proceed to the proof of the main point which I had in view in writing it. +. If the transverse axis of any conic hyperbola be called a, and the conjugate axis ib; and if the abscissa counted from the center on the transverse axis be called x, the corresponding ordinate y, and the length of the arch from the vertex to the ordinate 1th; then, by SIMPsoN's Fluxions, Art. 435 we have H J/X?bhx )or (putting ee i1+ bb,) HX V(eexx-i) MDCCCXI Q 114 Mr. HELLINS on the Rectfication -A 5.

Let us now (to simvplify thie expression) put m ere andAs this result differs friom that given by Mr. WOODHOUSv, in p. z6o of the Philosophical Transactions for i8o4, I have set clown the process at large, that the Intelligent reader may the more easily pp rceive where the truth lies. ofthe yperbola. 115 assume V = u V ('l75'UU); then, by taking the fluxions on * 1 * tr; * 1 Of Es tX U UU both sides, we shall havev= Ad/( _z U U U,1-uu v uu) X s (I -? uu) + (Z-E" . Here uI jES f), the first term on the right hand side of the equation, is evidently the fluxion of an arch of an ellipsis of which the transverse semi-axis is 1, the eccentricity is ?, and the abscissa (counted from the center) is u.

And as this has been done -by oe late writers on -the rectification of the ellipsis,* I shall, on t present occasion, only state and use the result in a notation con venient for an arithmetical calculator. Thus, putting i'= and vve+uu-V(ee-uu)(i-uu) and the fluent of V(1 U) E . ~uu) xi g u of (I UU of (Iuu)XV(I_4guu) _ -5 9( ciV(Cv) 7,\E2 it is certain that E is 22 ___ + I-E I-aE Multiply this equation by is, and write 2s for its equal X (1 + E),, and it becomes (i-e) F 2Eu + 2E-2 (1+e) 'E. If we now take the fluents of the fluxions in the equation marked (a) in the preceding Article, we shall have V= E-(1.-se) F+ J.. And since all these quantities begin e and increase together, this equation needs no correction. And by writing for (i?) F its value found in the preceding equation, we have V = -2eU-E + 2 (1+e) E+ > and thence by reduction and transposition, H=2? e u + e +e E e (1 + s) E'; which expression will be found to exceed that given (for the same purpose) by Mr. WOODHOUSE .in pf 6i o f the Philosophical Transactions for the year 1804, in the ratio of e to i.* See M.

S. I arn now to prove, that all the labour of computing the eccentricty* and abscissa, and the arch itself, of th is second ellipsis, and the subsequent operations of multiplication and subtraction requisite in the application of it to the rectification of the hyperbola, is altogether neemdess; since the sa'tm end may be obtained by only computing and applying the flient of ai s/ ($ ) , which will require no more calculation than mnust be made to find and apply the elliptic arch denoted by E (of which the axis, and eccentricity, and abscissa, are given).

Here then it appears, that the rectification of the hyperbola is accomplished by means of the algebraic quantity eV, When it is more convenient to use the conjugate semi-axis than the eccentricity, in the arithmetical calculation, then that must be computed instead of the eccentricity. l 8 Jr. HELLINS on the Rectication eu v/ I ' eux,) and e x the fluent of 'jU. And it is obvious to every competent judge that the arithmetical work of computing the value of G, with any given values of s and u, will be as short and easy as the computation of the elliptic arch denoted by E. Yet, for the more ready comnparison of the series, with each other, which arse in taking thd se fluents, I will here set them down in the, NEWTONIAN form, which undoubtedly is the most convenient for arithnetical calculations that has yet been discovered. 9V #(I I-Es UU) 1; SE UU 4U4 6 6 o0.

And, multiplying these quantities by their proper factors, and placing them in due order, we have S4D~6 ~G -A zB+3 C + 3-6' + 3--6'E,&C. ic. Now, by comparing together the fluents denoted by A' and A, B' and B, C' and C, &c. it is obvious that the arithmetical calculation of the one will not, in any respect, be more difficult than that of the other; and that A is always less than A', B than B', C than C', &c. And it is evident that each of the series denoted by E and G converges by the samne geometrical progression, viz. EA, S, s, &c. So that the arithmetical value of any number of terms of the latter series will always be nearer to the value of the whole, than the arithnetical value of the same number of terms of the former series will be to its whole. And as to transformations of the expression Ui I Ir/ into others, in order to obtain the fluent in series of swifter convergency, when te' case requires it;, it is obvious that similar operatiots may be p.r~firmed on the express sion (i). I 5'a M I.n the application of E and G to the recti cation of the byperbola, the one is multiplied by e, the other by ?, (see the 12O Mr. HELLINS on the Rectficatiot equations marked (C) and (a) in Art. 7 and 9,) which are operafions equally easy. Thus it appears, that all the Iabour' of computing tfle eccentricity, the abscisa, and the len'th of the elliptic arch denoted by 'E, and of applying it to the rectification of the hyperbola, is wholly unnecessary; and consequently, that that method is circulous, and more curous than usefu '. Some rther Observations on the Rectifcation of the Hyperola: among which the great Advantage of descending Series over as, cendng eB le., in many cases, is clearly shown; and sovera ethods gi e~ fzve r cop ting the constant Quantity by which those Series dfer fromn each other. all. The new series above given in Art. id it is obvious, will converge swiftly so long as u is small i n con parison of i; (which it will be when x is not much greater than t;) so that thnis series will be very convenient for computing a small arch of ane hyperbola near the vertex even when a is nearly = X: and, when ? is small in comparison of i, any arch, how great so ever may easily be computed by it. But, when r is nearly I and uu is greater than j, this series will conver ge but slowly; and, for that reason, xill not be an eligible form arthmietical calclation. In such cases, however, a swift con." verq:en: .y w'II take place in some of the descending series (discovered by -me, and) inserted in the Philosophical Trans.* By comparing the expressions marked y and , in Article 9 of this Paper, with the short pragraph near the top of page z6i of the Philosophical Transactions for X8o4 tie n<iahemaflcal reader will quickly perceive that Mr. WOQDHoUSE has te.re assrtete too much of the I-ype rb o 12a actions for 1802. And as those descending series differ from the ascending ones3 by a constant quantity, (as is there shown,) I will now add something to what was then said on the me. thods of computing the valu1 of that constant quantity. 14. It is very evident from b ahat is done in the Philosophical Transactions for 18o2, from page 4Go to page 465, that the constant quantity here spoken of is no other than the difference between the length of the arch of the hyperbola and its tandent, " when the point of contact" (to use LANDERS words,) "is supposed to be carried to an infinite distance from "the vertex of the curve :" which diff rence is undoubtedly the same as to the difference between the Iength of the arch "infinitelyfproduced and its asym ptote"'-(as SrIMPSON expresses it.) And since each of these ei-niuent n 'tienaticians, and MAC LAURIN also, (as I before observed,) has treated of this difference, it s ems requisite that I should here give a brief statement of their methods of conputinlg it, and compare them with such of my own as I oAir to P ile.li.

In like manner, X being written instead of a, in the second* See LAN DEN'S Memoirs, Vol. 1. p. 23. See his Fluxions, Art, 435.,MDCCCXI.

And this series will be found to agree also with the value Gf aG in the equation marked (?) in Art. 9, when u becomes i. For, in that case, eV ex denotes the asymptote, and II the infinite arch of the hyperbola; and we have, by transposition, ex -H -G. And, u being = 1, A, the first term of the series denoted by G in Art. 11, becomes = the area of a quadrant of a circle of which the radius is i, that is, 7: B becomes= -A N: C becomes _ .4 Dbe2 ~~ ~~4 2.46 46 comes = 5C 3. 5 N &c. and these values being written for 8 2.4.6.8 ,A, B, C, D, &c. and the whole x E, we have aG = N x : + 3s 3-30 3.3.5.5s7 24 + + &c. perfectly agreeing with the 224 2.2.4.4.6 2244668 series above stated. This series, it is obvious, will converge but slowly when e is not much greater, and consequently a not much less, than i; that is when b is small in comparison of 1. But, in such cases other series which have a good rate of convergency may be used, as was shown in my former paper on the Rectification of t he Hyperbola. of the Hyperbola, and will more fully appear in the following pages. Mr. LANDEN'S methods of computing the aforesaid difference next come under consideration: and, first, his method of computing it by means of the arches of two ellipses. 16. We have seen above, that, when x becomes immensely great, u becomes -i; and in this case the equation (C) in Art. 7 becomes H 9 + ex + eE ( + e) E from which we have ex -H _2 ( 1 + e) 'EeE 2, another expression of the difference between the length of the asynptote and the infinite arch: which expression, however, is not so convenient for arithnetical calculation as the preceding. For here E denotes the quadrantal arch of an ellipsis of which the transverse semi-axis is 1, and the eccentricity a; w rhich arch is N x:1 & C . 33 -C 5 798 2.2 22.4.4 .2.4.4 6.6 2.S446.6.8.8 so that the computation of eE = N x : e3 3 73-3^5 5-7 &c., will require as much Labour as the computation of sG, wXhicl is the very diflfrence sought. (See the preceding Art.) But, by this method, we have yet to compute the elliptic arch denoted by 'E, of which the transverse semi-axis is 1, the eccentricity = I+' (=I +?,) and abscissa v V(J) /(e and then there must be a multiplication of this qua ltity by X (i + e), and, after that, a subtraction of eE + 2 from the product, to obtain the diffirence sought: all which labour is more than is required by the method described in the preceding article. Here, then, we have a striking instance (and a thousand more might be produced) of the inutility of rectifying the hyyperbola by means of two ellipses. R 4do lur. HELLIN on the RectJica'iol' I 7. But Mr. LANDEN discovered another and a better 'lee thod of computing the difference in question, which is briefly thisIf from C. the center of an hyperbola, CP be drawn perpendicular to DP, a tangent to the curve in D; and if the transverse semi-axis CA be = m, the conjugate semi-axis = n, the perpendicular CP = pl andiff be put= m n and Z-' 2M nJI) c I A B Pthen will the difference between the length of the tangent, DP and the arch AD be universally expressed by d the fluent of 2(nn+:zf zZZ)j where d is a constant quantity the fluent generated while z increases from o to mn.

Mr. LANDEN has no where, that I know of, exhibited the fluent of the above fluxion in series, but in the followiing manner,* Denoting the fluent of = generated * See his zd Memoir, Art. 5. f Itie Hyperbola. 125 vhle p i-,creases from o to m, by L, (which I denote by d,) he says ati, when the abscissa CE is x V( + m+n) (at wohich time the ordinate BD isit x n and IVe t-angrent PF =V(rnm + it)), then L, (or d,) is = DP -2AD + n -V(rmm+nn) n+V /(mm+it) 2AD. 1S.

The fluent of i e p n m {(mm pp) V(nn + pp) V ( n + /(m m+n being obtained in converging series, whatever be the ratio of m to n; let this particular value of it be denoted by (, (to distinguish it from the general value denoted by i,) and substituted in the general equation d = DP -AD, in Art. 17, and we shall have d= DPAD ; and this value of DP AD being substituted for it in the particular equation L d2DP -2AD+ nT _/(mm + an) in tbe same of the Hyperbola. 129 Article (in which equation DP= / (mm+nn),) we have d= ad -2 + nV(mm + nn), and hence L d -2 + V (mm + un) -n, which is the difference, or quantity sought. 23. 1 come now to make a comparison of Mr. LANDEN'S last mentioned method of computing the difference in question with some of my own methods. We have already seen in Art. 20, that, when the conjugate axis of the hyperbola is greater than the transverse, LANDEN'S method is not wanted, since the operation by the old series will, in general, be easier. The comparison therefore, now to be made, is only in cases when the conjugate axis is -equal to, or less than, the transverse axis. It appears from Art. 9, i , and 17 of this Paper, that, when m is put= 1, and x is taken =m V(i + m the value of Es UU is the powers of which fraction form, the geometrical progression which will have place in the series denoted by G, from which LH, or the arch AD is quickly obtained. And, with these values of m and x, we have, by Art. 19, 1-= _-,-the powers of which fraction form the geometrical progression which will have place in the series denoted by (. When n is taken = i, the former of these algebraic fractions is the latter is As the one fraction increases with n, and the other decreases, it is easy to find that value of n which shall make them equal, viz. n _ V(2 + V20) = o0786, &c.; and, with this value of n, each of these fractions is = o381966, &c. Thus it appears, that, n having any value greater than ? V(2 + MDCCCXI. S 130 Mr. HELLINS on the Rectification I~~~~~~~~~ ,/9o ),the fraction ,+nn+,,V(' nf) viii be less than -and less than o'381966; and consequentiy that the hyperbolic arch AD mav be more easily obtained from the Series denoted by G, in Art. i1i, than by either of" those denoted by c in Art. i8. And hence we may derive another expresssion of the value of d, in the following manner. W * * ~~~~ee xx ee Since zu 'is universally ee Xx-_ CC (see equation r1i in 4 ~~~~~~~~~ee xx) Art. 5, where e denotes the eccentricity ;) by putting xx = 1 + V('n) and writing i + Lnu instead of ee, we shall have V(' +nn) UU I gU ) and a&e ftu --a ee='snnn) Let the n+V(I-mnn) C~ee i-nnnj n) value of G, corresponding to these values of u and e, be denoted by r; then, by the equation ( a) in Art. 9, the hyperbolic arch AD = I, is = eV e. But, since V was put ux, (see Art. 5 and 6,) it will in this case be =, Writing therefore'e er for AD, and i for m, in the equation atthe end of Art. 17, we have d = n + / (t + nn) 2e + 9rP 2sr It now appears, that d, the difference between the length of an infinite arch of an hyperbola and its tangent, or asymptote, may be computed by means of one series converging swifter than the powers of -4, even in the most disadvantage. ous case; so that a dozen terms of it will be sufficient for all common uses: but, that a series of such convergency WAS attainable in this case, appears not to have been observed by either of the writers before, mentioned. 25. If the transverse and conjugate semi-axes of an hyperbola are denoted by a and i, respectively, the ordinate by y, and the arch by z; and if V(aa + ), the eccentricity, be oj the Hyper l1a. 31 put e, and if e be written instead of y, in Theorems II. and ,Ve IV. in pages 453 and 454 of the Philos. Trans. for 1802; then, (as appears by pages 466 and 467 of the same Vol.) the corresponding value of z may be obtained from either of the following equations, viz. 1. z_ A -B + A C 36 D + 2356, E, &c. 2. z + d=Fev(+ +) L+ e A 'B.3 + z.C.65 z..6.8c D', &c in the first of which equations A /(i + e) + LH.

Hence we have d = + e2Z, which is the very equation at the end of Art. 17, obtained by LANDEN'S method, the difference being only in the notation. It appears by this result, that the constant difference between the values of the ascending and descending series, here denoted by d, is equal to the difference between the lengths of the infinite arch and its tangent, as was observed in Art. 14, and may be briefly proved thus: by the notation specified at the beginning of this Art. and the property of the curve, as i : e :: y: ey, the length of a line drawn parallel. to the asymptote from the extremity of the ordinate to the transverse axis; which line, when y becomes immensely great, will coincide with the tangent drawn from the same point, and will be equal to the corresponding portion of the asymptote. And' it appears by Art. .1 of my former Paper on thle Rectification of the Hyperbola, (see Philos. Trans. for 1802, p. -461,) that the corresponding arch of the hyperbola, z, is = ey d. We therefore have, in this case, d the asymptote-the liZfinite arch. 26. Thus is LANDEN'S best theorem respecting the rectifi cation of the hyperbola obtained by the common application of Sir ISAAC NEWTON'S doctrine of infinite series. And I further observe, in transitu, that FAGNANI'S theorem, respecting the rectification of the ellipsis, is attainable in the same easy manner. These devices are indeed very ingenious ; but their ]'tH FELINSJ on the Rectcation utility appearts to me to be much less than has been Imagined. It has been represented even in these Transactions, for the year 1804, p. 236; that FAGNANI'S theorem is necessary to the investigation of EULER'S series for computingg the length of a quadrantal arch of an ellipsis ; yet, the fact is, that FAGNANI'S theore n is no more requisite on that occasion than LANDEN'S theorem is in the investigation of a siilar series for computing the difference between the lengths of an infinite arch of an hyperbola and its asymptote, which will be given in this Paper. 27. It appears by inspecting the values of z and z + d, exhibited in terms of e and 1, in Art. 25, that when y becomes equal to, or greater than, ..L Theorem IV. will be more ,Ve' eligible for arithmetical calculation than Theorem II. It is obvious also, from the same article, that no more than one of those values need be computed in order to obtain the value of d. Putting, therefore, (for the value of z corresponding toy -, and S L+2A .4B'+ 2.+ 5C&c. (Al, B', C', &c. being as there specified,) we have S = Sdo and this value being written for ' in the equation d t + e 2, it becomes d= 1 +e + 2d2S; from which we have d = 2S --e, which is another convenientformula for coinputing the value of d. 28. If the diagonal line of quantities in which I enters, either in the value of z or z + d, before referred to, were written by itself, and the remaining perpendicular columns summed in the manner by ne described in the Philos. Transfor 1798, p. 51,8 et seq. the value of d might be obtained in a pair of of the Hyperbola. 135 series, each of them converging by the powers of ee . But the advantage of computing by such a pair of series, instead of the single one above described, is less than might at first be imagined; for, in order to have a result true to the saine numbcr of figures, about the same number of terms must be computed, whether of the single series or of the pair. Since, thic efore, the advantage obtained by such a transformation lies not in the literal powers, it call have place only in the coefficients; arnd there it may be very considerable. I now proceed to the investigation of a pair of series for computing the value of the constant quantity d, each of which converges by the powers of I aa 29. If the transverse arnd conjugate Cemi-axes of an hyperbola ure denoted by a aiAd i, respectively, the ordinate by y, aced th corresponding arch by z; and if the eccentricity, Vlaa + -, be denoted by e, and i + eeyy be put : uu; then, as I h'ave she vn in the Philos.

Now, when y o, then z =on and u becomes i; and the value of the series, in this case, is the value of d; and this value, if the terms of the series are ranged one under another according to the powers of al, will stand as below, viz. d aa ~~A V1 + a] + A 3V(1+aa) 3A 2.42a 2 .4.-Jazz 35V( 1?

S. If we look back to Art. i8 and 20 of this Paper, we shall find that, when the transverse and conjugate semi-axes of an hyperbola are denoted by 1 and I respectively, (which hyperbola will be similar to that of which the semi-axes are a and 1,) the convergency of the first series, derived from LANDEN'S theorem, will be by the powers of the fraction I a A1 I VI a ),assisted by coefficients. And the same rate of convergency wvill obtain in the series given in Art. 29, by putting y = for then HU, by which the terms of that series are divided, will be = X + e, e being Vaas + 1: so that, when aa is less than 1 + Vlaa + I, the terms of the single series will decrease swifter than the terms of the pair of series; and consequently half as many terms of the former as, the latter will give a result equally near the truth. The two quantities aa and i + Vaa + 1 are equal when aa = -; and hence it appears, that the proper uise of the pair of series above found, is, when a is-considerably* See Philos. Trans. for 1804, p. Z35. of the Hyperbola 1 greater than V3e When a is a large number, about as many terms of the single series as of the pair must be computed to have the results true to the sai e number of figUres; yet the operation by th e pa-ir will be by much the easiest. . If both sides of the equation a A + B _C +} Dg e _ [ L a a as a7 Were divided by and if were put 'd, and -L b; then, (since H. L. of b would be 1,) we should have 'd, r t Abb + Bb4 _ C6 + Db3, &C. I x bb b4 + ybW &C. where 'd denotes the difference between the lengths of the infinite arch and the asymptote, (and the difference also between the values of the ascending and descending series for computing the arch,) of an hyperbola of which the seini-axes are 1 and b, respectively. 36. It vas observed in Art. 12, that the fluxion there given, of an Ihyperbolic archn, is as capable of transformation as that which has been commionly used fcr the rectification of an ellipsis: so also are those which I have used in the Philos. Trans. for 1802, p. 451 and 455, a'd from which series converging by the powers of &c. may easily be obtained; but to treat of suc h transformations is not only foreign from mny present design, but would extend this paper to a considerable Ieugth. I shall therefore o ly pomi t out, by a few examples, the great advantage, in mrtany cases, of computing by descending series, and then conclude. 37. Example i. The transverse and conjugzate semi-axes JIDCCCXx. U 150 Mr. IJELLINS on the RectJifcation of an hyperbola are 7 and 1, respectively; it -is requi Ied to find the lengths of thiree arches of Nvhich the three ordinates are lo, 2o, and 30. Setting aside the circuit-ous method of rectifyig the hlyper. bola by mneans of two elli'es,) if cie was to think of comput-. ing these arches by meins ef a sintiar hyplrbola, and by the theorem (g) given in Art. 9) ( vhich is a very usefui Jormiula wihini the limits specified in Art. 3,) he voUWI quicikly perceive, that the ascending series, by vhich the value of G is obtainedc, would converge very slowly; and therefore would make c oice of some other rict-tod. Theoremn IV. in my Tormer tract (see Philos. Trans. for 18o2, p. 4,54,) is a very ,onvenient form to be useid on this occasi ;n, and is as follNoss Retaining the notation used in the bf gnnin1g of Art. 29, re , LVify + y c -v '(yy+') _13 D _ -t/(Y?3 ) 5C &c. &c. frst part of the work may be to find the valu4e of d Nhich many easily be dS~ne by the pair of series given in .Art. 32; b~ut, since a comzputation of it was mrade by tw~o series, inl p. 466, 467, and 468 of the volume here referred to, the a cending series lbein-g =oQ6360768, the] ceesccndting se ics Oft eilyperboIa. 15' 7`4349912, and their difference, d, = 6 i989144; we need only to verify that work, w hich may easily be done by the FormuIe given in Art and , thus: denotiig t he value of the ascending series corresponding to the ordin'ate * by C, and the value of the des ending series correspondi'11 to tile Sanme ordinate by S, we hfave, ? ;= ~S-o7:to678 by Art. 25, d =2 ,J _ 7'.6 J 6-7989 I 40 > r6 1 39984 by Art. d .xS e, '9 8 o678 6-7989146; the difference in the last figures of the results arising from the inaccuracy of decimal fractions, and being wholly inconiderable.

And if seven more arches of this hyperbola, corresponding to the ordinates 4Lj), 50, Go, &c. to loo, were to be comnputed, this theorem would afbord a stiiking instance of the great utility of descending series. ,38. A second example might be, to find the lengths of ten arches of anr equilateral hyperbola, of which the semi-axis is 1, when the ordinates are a, 2,s 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, A, and io. These arches may be computed by the new theorem given in Art. 9 in which the value of G is always given in ascend-ing series; but that series, when y is much greater than i,, will converge very little faster than the powers of ?: whereas, by using the theorem given in the Philos.

In these examples the use and advantage of descending series appear: more examples of their utility might be given; and it might easily be shown, that there are. cases in which Mr. 1ELLINS On the IRect~icat on, ,c such series have the advat tage, even when the ascendiig series have a good rate of conver gency, I trust however, thaze enough has been done, in this Paper to satisfy all candid and competent juaures of the matter, that the Rectftcat olz ofq ihe Hjperbola by means of two E lkyses is more curious than usez ful; that the advantage of computing by descending series Is, in many cases, very great; and that such series will often answer the end of a transformation without the trouble of naking it.
