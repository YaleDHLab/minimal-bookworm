53 ] II. On the Attraction of the Himalaya Mountains, and of 'the elevated regions beyond them, upon the Plumb-line in India. By the Venerable JOHN HENRY PRATT, M.A., Archdeacon of Calcutta. Communicated by the Rev. J. CHALLIS, ALA., F. R.S. 8Sc. Received October 23,-Read December 7, 1854. 1. IT is now well known that the attraction of the Himalaya Mountains, and of the elevated regions lying beyond them, has a sensible influence upon the plumb-line in North India. This circumstance has been brought to light during the progress of the great trigonometrical survey of that country. It has been found by triangulation that the difference of latitude between the two extreme stations of the northern division of the arc, that is, between Kalianpur and Kaliana, is 50 23' 42" 294, whereas astronomical observations show a difference of 5? 23" 37"'058, which is 511.236* less than the former. 2. That the geodetic operations are not in fault appears from this; that two bases, about seven miles long, at the extremities of the arc having been measured with the utmost care, and also the length of the northern base having been computed from the measured length of the southern one, through a chain of triangles stretching along the whole arc, about 370 miles in extent, the difference between the measured and the computed lengths of the northern base was only 0-6 of a foot, an error which would produce, even if wholly lying in the meridian, a difference of latitude no greater than 0"006. 3. The difference 5"236 must therefore be attributed to some other cause than error in the geodetic operations. A very probable cause is the attraction of the superficial matter which lies in such abundance on the north of the Indian arc. This disturbing cause acts in the right direction; for the tendency of the mountain mass must be to draw the lead of the plumib-line at the northern extremity of the arc more to the north than at the southern extremity, which is further removed from the attracting mass. hence the effect of the attraction will be to lessen the difference of latitude, which is the effect observed. Whether this cause will account for the error in the difference of latitude in quantity, as well as in direction, remains to be considered, and is the question I propose to discuss in the present paper. 4. But if mountain attraction have any sensible influence at the stations on the arc, how is it that the geodetic operations are not affected by it? How is it that such a remarkable degree of exactness between the measured and computed lengths of the* This is the difference as stated by Colonel EVEREST in his work on the Measurement of the Meridional Arc of India, published in 1847. See p. clxxviii.MDCCCLV. 54 ARCHDEACON PRATT ON THE ATTRACTION OF THE northern base attests, it would seem, to the non-existence of any external disturbing cause ? For in observing the altitude or depression of one station in the triangulation as seen from another, the error on the plumb-line must come into the calculation. The answer is that these small errors occur in the calculation of the horizontal arc in very small terms not higher than the second order; whereas in the expression for the inclination of the two verticals at the extremities of the arc they occur in terms of the first order. This I will further illustrate. 5. Suppose the arc divided into n equal Fig. 1. portions: and let V0V1V2--.v, be the deflecX / tions of the plumb-line at the n+ 1 stations thus chosen. Let A be one of these stations, and B the next towards the south; Az, B Ax vertical and horizontal lines through A on the supposition that there is no mount -_M__ tain attraction; Az', Ax' the vertical and horizontal lines as affected by attraction. Draw BM and BM' perpendicular to Ax and Ax': let AM-a, BM=h, ZzAz'=v, Z BAM=ca. Then AM is the true horizontal distance between A and B, and AM' the calculated horizontal distance. Hence the calculation makes this portion of the arc too short by AM-.AM'=AM (I -Cos a a(tan a. sinv+ -cos v)h. v+ ia. P2 neglecting the cube and higher powers of P. Hence the whole arc is made too short by hroy+hip, + hr2+ .... + hnpv+2(p2+ +p2 +v 2.... +V2)j h0h1h2. .. k,, being the heights of the various stations of observation above the trne horizontal line. When the Station B is below A then h is negative. These heights are all extremely small compared with a, as the are lies through a comparatively flat country. Hence the expression for the error in the length of the arc is made up, as I said, of small terms of no higher order than the second; whereas the error in the difference of latitude (=vnj-o) has terms of the first order. 6. That this expression for the shortening of the arc is a minute quantity utterly inappreciable, may easily be shown by taking an extreme case. The quantities hohlh2..lht are some of them positive and some of them negative, in such a manner that their algebraical sum equals the difference of height of Kalianpur and Kaliana above the level of the sea. From Colonel EVEREST's work on the Indian Arc (published in 1847) 1 gather, that between Kalianpur and Kaliana there are forty-seven principal stations, or, including the two terminal ones, forty-nine: and the Survey HIMALAYAS ON THE PLUMB-LINE IN INDIA. 55 shows that in passing from north to south there are twenty-five elevations of one station above the level of the preceding one, amounting in all to 3901 *I feet and twenty-three depressions, amounting to 2965&2 feet (see pp. 269-273). The difference between these =935 9 feet, which is the height assigned to Kalianpur above Kaliana. I will take these, then, as the values of hohh12..h. in my present example; so that the sum of the positive quantities among hI0hh2...=3901-1 feet, and the sum of the negative =2965 2, and n=48. Now P. is the greatest and IP is the least of the quantities vs.. Hence it follows, that hovo0+hvj+.-..+hiv. is less than 3901V1vY-2 965 .2vo, and therefore, much more, less than 39011vY, feet. Now by the Survey v,,-v0=5`"236, or in arcs =0#000025; h.* h0o+hjv+... +hYv. is less than 390141 X0*000025 or 0'097527 foot. If in this extreme case of supposing the attraction to equal its greatest value at more than half of the stations, and that at stations where its effect would be greatest, the result is so insignificant, what must it be in the actual case*? The same may be shown with respect to the other term in the expression for the shortening of 1 n~~~~~~+1 the arc, viz. !a(vY+vd+... .v2). This quantity is less than +2 a.v2; or, if we reckon the distance between Kaliana and Kalianpur to be 370 miles, and therefore n.a=370 X 1760 x 3 feet and n=48, this quantity is less than 0 008 of a foot, which is utterly inappreciable. Hence mountain attraction may have a sensible value at the stations on the arc, and yet not affect the geodetic calculations in the slightest appreciable degree+. 7. I can see no ground, therefore, whatever for the process of dispersion which Colonel EvEREST describes at page clxx of the Introduction to his work, by which he distributes the error 5" 236 among the triangles. It appears to me to be unquestionable that the geodetic operations are in no way sensibly affected by mountain attraction, and therefore need no correction whatever on that account. It is the astronomical operation of observing the difference of latitude which requires the correction. That it is here that the correction must be applied appears again in attempting to determine the azimuths of the arc at seven stations astronomicalliy (see p. xlii). It is only when the plumb-line is brought into use to determine the vertical angles of stars that the effect of attraction becomes sensible; and never in the geodetic calculations, where only horizontal angles or extremely minute vertical angles (viz, the elevations or depressions of hoh.12...) are observed. 8. The importance of accounting satisfactorily for the difference between the geodetic * If the triangulation be carried into elevated regions some of the values of 1Z0411Z .-.. will be large-; and therefore the conclusion in the text will not in that case stand. t In this paper I show that the difference caused by attraction in the latitudes of the extremities of the northern division of the arc, viz. Kaliana and Kalianpur, amounts to 15tt885, which is more than three times the angle 5"t 236. But the conclusion arrived at in art;. 6. is still true. I 2 56 ARCHDEACON PRATT ON THE ATTRACTION OF TH E and astronomical results appears from the effect it must have upon the determination of the earth's ellipticity; an effect such, that unless this quantity be fully accounted for, it must render the great Indian Survey comuparatively useless in the delicate problem of the Figure of the Earth, however valuable it may be for the purposes of mapping the vast continent of I-hn(lostan. 9. The effect of a small error in the difference of latitude upon the determination of the ellipticity may be calculated as follows:Let s be the ellipticity, a quantity known not to differ mnuch from 300 A the amplitude of the arc; p the latitude of the middle point of the arc. Then by the usual formula length of are iI3sn o () equatorial radius: 26 But sink (j-62+.); X=-0 23' 37" for the arc between Kalianpur and Kaliana =0094 in parts of the radius, 62 -x=0 00147. Hence by putting X instead of sin X in the above formula, we shall be omitting a quantity of the order OX0 000441 cos 2pi, which is utterly insignificant, length of are -3-~cs equatorial radius 2 2 In the same way if L be the amplitude and M the latitude of the middle point of another arc, length of arc L / 1\ / 3 equatorial radius = 2 I c 2M) length of arc LL os 2M)V length of are LIA { 1-(cos 2fk-co2 Suppose the observed values of X and pA are subject to small errors owing to tnountain attraction; to find the effect on ? we must differentiate this expression, supposing the angles , p' and s variable and the other quantities constant, 0=-dA{ -2s(cos 2pbcos 2M)} +3Xs sin 2p(.dP,--X(cos 2pi-cos 2M)rd, 2 Ax 2 A 3 (cos 2-cos 2M)' neglecting extremely small quantities of the higher order. Now in the case before us, X= latitude of Kaliana latitude of Kalianpur, =29? 30' 48"-24? 7' 1 1"_5? 23' 37", HIMALAYAS ON THE PLUMB-LINE IN INDIA. 57 P= half the sum of these latitudes, =260 49'; cos 2p= 059295. Suppose dA= 1" only; then de= 2 50 23' 38" 3(0P59295-cos 2M) 1 2 58254 059295-cos 2M This will be smallest when 2M is chosen as nearly 1800 as possible. The great arc lately measured near North Cape is the one which will best meet this condition.Put therefore M= 700, cos 2M 0076604, and 1 2 58254 1,35899 39585 if we put for E. Hence for an error of 5" 236 in defect in the amplitude, the effect on the ellipticity 5*236 E will be to diminish it by 132 s2 nearly, or by nearly -W-th part of its whole value, under the most favourable circumstances. This is sufficient to show the great importance of endeavouring to account satisfactorily for the discrepancy brought to light by the Indian Survey; and that, not bv merely putting it down to mountain attraction, but by calculating that attraction by some independent means, with a view to see whether its amount actually corresponds with the observed anomnaly*. 10. To dissect and actually to calculate the attraction of the masses of which the Himalayas, and the regions beyond, are composed, appears, at the very thought of it, to be an herculean undertaking next to impossible. I am fully convinced, however, that no other method will succeed. It is upon this plan that the solution of the problem is conducted in this paper. It will be seen, that by selecting a peculiar law of dissection the calculation is very greatly simplified, and made to depend entirely and solely upon a knowledge of the elevations and depressions, in fact, the general contour of the surface. This information for some part of the mass is already supplied by the Maps of the Trigonometrical Survey. 11, In the following pages I propose, in the first place, to develope my method of calculation, and to deduce a formula by which the attraction can be determined with a precision corresponding to the degree of accuracy to which the contour of the surface is known. * If the effect of mountain attraction upon the northern division of the arc be what I make it, 15" '885, then the ellipticity as determined from this and the Russian arc would be too small by E, if mountain attraction is neglected. The error in the ellipticity in comparing the whole arc between Kaliana and Damargida with the North Cape arc will, under the same circumstances, amount even to 'E. This will appear from the sequel, and is here mentioned only to illustrate the importance of the subject under consideration. 58 ARCHDEACON PRATT ON THE ATTRACTION OF THE In the second place, I propose to reduce the formula to numbers, and so arrive at such ant approximate value of the attraction as the data I have been able to collect will allow. 12. This approximate value is, as will be seen, larger than 5" 236, the error brought to light by the Survey. I make various suppositions with a view, if possible, to reduce my result to this, but without effect. This leads me to look in another direction for an explanation of the cause of discordance, and I arrive at a conclusion which clears up the discrepancy, confirms the calculations of this paper, and illustrates the importance of not disregarding the influence of mountain attraction. I. Determination of a Formulafor calculating Mountain Attraction on the stations of the Indian Arc. 13. Let 0 be the centre of a circle AQ, AT the Fig. 2. tangent at A, QR a slender prism of mass M, being T the prolongation of the radius through the point Q. Then if AQUa, AR=b, 4 QAR=w, and Z AOQ=O, Q the following is true:Lemma.-The attraction of the prism QR on the point A in the direction AT cos 2{ +tan2tan2 For let P be any point of the prism, QP=z, QR=h, Z PAQ= , 1 dz mass of element of prism at P_ h 5 attraction of this on A in direction AP=M M PA2' attraction of this on A in direction AT=M d PA2cP Cos PAT-=cos 1 Cos 0 AP 2 h sin a EI+,1, C 1os 0 2 ~~~~2 z=QP=a (l =a(cos20tan (o0+%)-sin2 ) dz 1 4---a cosOsece'O'4i HIMALAYAS ON THE PLUMB-LINE IN INDIA. 59 Putting these values in the above expression, attraction of element at P on A in direction AT M / =bnXCos (2 ?-+)d+; =ab sin w co2 attraction of prism QR on A in direction AT a6M c{onstant-sin (I 0-A) } from ,=O to +=w; ab sin sin 2-?-sin (2 .-c3 2 =ab csin {1 blnwak M iF 1-cosw 1a "M 2 (ab cos 2{1+tan 2 tan 2d} 14. Corollary. The above formula will reduce itself to the following in the cases to which we have to apply it. M I Attraction of prism on A in direction AT= ci Cos 2. For in these cases AQ is the circumference, and 0 the centre, of the earth; QR the height of any point of the surface above the sea-level at A.

But w is never greater than 2? (=0-03488 in arcs), and when it has this maximum value, 0 is less than 2?; and as 0 increases, w decreases in a higher degree. Hence the second term within the brackets is of insensible importance, and the corollary as enunciated is true. 15. In order to calculate the attraction of the superficial crust of the earth upon the point A on its surface, I shall suppose a number of vertical planes to be drawn through A making any angles with each other, and thus dividing the surface through A, parallel to the sea-level, into a number of lunes all meeting again in a point in the antipodes of A. About A as centre suppose a number of concentric circles drawn on this surface; the -law of the distances of -these circles will be determined hereafter. In this way the whole surface will be divided into a number of four-sided compartments, two of the sides in every compartment converging to A, -and the other two being parts of circles concentric in A. 60 ARCHDEACON PRATT ON THE ATTRACTION OF THE Let ABB'andACC' be parts of two of Fig. 3. the great circles forming these lunes; A _ BCC'B' one of the four-sided compartments. Let Z BAC=j3, ZAOB=ea, ZBOB'=P; Q an element of the compartment; qQq' parallel to BC; ZQAN= 4, AN being a great circle bisecting the angle f, and AT a tangent to AN; AO=r, Z AOQ=; I distance of Q from AO=r sin d; and r sin 0 d+,, and rd4 are the sides of the element Q. Let k' be the height of R, the earth's surface, above Q; g the mean density of the superficial matter of the earth; mass of prism QR=ek'r2 sin 0 dd d4+; also chord AQ= 2r sin 4. Hence by the corollary in Art. 14, attraction of prism QR on A along the tangent to AQ k'r2 sin 0 dO d$ I 4r2 sin2 I & 2 attraction of prism QR on A along AT k'r2 sin 0 dO d+ 1 4r2 sin2 1 2 2 Integrating with respect to 4,, from 4=-2 3 to 3 attraction on A of the mass standing on qq' in direction AT g sin cos8d8 A2 g sin cos-8dA =, % 12 \k'cos ---n2! 2sin3.k very nearly, 4 sin2-? 0 4 siA2? 2 2 k being the average value of k' on the arc qq'; cos2 1 0 sin 0 16. The degree of error incurred in thus taking k for k' may be judged of by applying the formula to an extreme case. For example, let us suppose that the surface of HIMALAYAS ON THE PLUMB-LINE IN INDIA. 61 the earth at this part is a plane passing through the middle point of the elementary base qQq', and sloping upwards towards the side on which A lies. This is an extreme case; for the actual height will be extremely small near the middle of qq', that is, in parts where the variations of cos 4 are least; and the actual heights will be greatest towards q and q', that is, in parts where the variations of cos 4 are greatest. Hence the error incurred in replacing, the actual heights by their average will be much greater in this than in a more general case. Now in this extreme instance k'=(c-c cos 4') tan , c being the distance of qQq' from A, and v the inclination of the plane to the horizon. Hence the true value of the integral k' cos 4'd4'=c tan n (cos 4-cos' )d4 =c tan ;72sinip-P 2--sinp3 2 2~~~~~~12 c tan (2s ; j3-197si p) And the approximate value of the integral =2 sin 2-.k=2 sin 2 0 2 (c-ccos @'tan,7d; 7 -4 2c I ~ " = sin tan;7 (P-2 sin ) =c tan (A7 (35 3705+ )** Hence the ratio of the true value to the approximate value =1120 . If p=30, the width I intend to give to the lunes, this ratio differs from unity by the insignificant fraction 0 00228, which we may well neglect; and if this is the smallness of the error in such an extreme case, we may consider that the approximation will in the general case differ from the true value by an inappreciable quantity. 17. To find the attraction of the whole mass comprised within the compartment, the expression (1) in art. 15. should be integrated with respect to 0 from O=a to o=a+p. But to do this we ought to know what function k is of 0. There is, however, no known law of connexion between them. We must therefore resort to some other means. According to the law of dissection, which I shall in the end Cos2 GO2adopt, the value of-2 does not vary much within the limits of a single compartsin 0 ment, that is, between the limits O=oa and Oa+p-. Indeed its middle value, when 9=?6+2 0-, is only one-fifteenth part smaller than its greatest value, when O=a, and MnCCCLv. K 62 ARCHDEACON PRATT ON THE ATTRACTION OF THE only one-sixteenth part greater than its smallest value, when O=a+P. I shall therefore take this middle value instead of the variable value, and the expression (1.) becomes integrable. Suppose h is the mean value of k from O=a to O=a+p; then Attraction of whole mass standing on the compartment BBIC'C C08`2 (1a+gsinlj* (2. sin (a2+ By this approximation the attraction of the nearer and narrower part of the mass is made a little too small, and that of the further and wider part a little too large. These errors tend to counterbalance each other; and the residual error, if any, will be very trifling. In some of the compartments the compensation may be exact; in others, in excess; in others, in defect-according to the variations of k. So that taking all the masses on the lune, the probabilities are that the compensation on the whole will be perfect, and that no error will be incurred. Ico 18, TJhat the extreme values of 2 do not, differ more than one-fifteenth and sin 6 one-sixteenth from its middle value appears as follows:According to the law of dissection, which I shall soon adopt, P=i_0t1 when a is very small; =gos, when a is about 38?; @=g a, when M is about 520 30'; a, when a is about 650; a, when M is about 760; a, when a is about 840; a,, when aM is about 1300; and p has intermediate values for intermediate values of ez, and of course the smaller the ratio which p bears to a, the less will be the error in our approximation. Now out of 49 cases in which we have to use the formula (2.), HIMALAYAS ON THE PLUMIB-LINE IN INDIA. 63 a is less than 380, and p is less than 5acin 40 cases. I a is less than 52? 30', and p is less than a, in 3 cases. so is less than 65?, and ( is less than aos, in 2 cases. a is less than 765; and p is less than q, in 2 case. a is less than 847 and p is less than a in I case. a is less than 1300, and p is less than ?a in I case. 4, a is greater than 1300, and p is greater than ,a in I case. 49 Let us take, then, the extreme case of the first 40, viz. -=380 and p= a. Hence a+ p=40' 6', and a+p=42? 13'; and Diffeence. Ratio to Difference, middle value. Greatest value of CS2 -2746| sin!0 0'172 -lIth. Middle _=2574 0l156 -1-th.

Suppose that there are n such pairs, and that they form two series in arithmetic progression, -....O..0 and o ....+16 1 1+ n+1 The sums of these two series are . -? and +. -, 152 1-6 2 and hence the average error or the mean of these I 1 n4-1 I ~2n+2 1 j5-16 2 n F 960 2n+-1" 7960' when n is indefinitely increased. Hence the probable error in this extreme 40th case is in defect, and is about ---th part of the whole. The probable error in the 9 cases beyond the 40th will be greater than this; but for the 39 cases before the 40th far less and less. K a 64 ARCHDEACON PRATT ON THE ATTRACTION OF THE Hence in the whole lune we may fairly consider that no appreciable error will be incurred. 19. 1 now proceed to select the Law of Dissection, that is, the relation of the lengths of the respective compartments to their distances from, A. Upon this depends the simplicity and the success of the method of calculation now proposed. Let the relation between a and p be always such, that (11) \ = a numerical constant =c. Sin a+-0JI To fix the value of this constant I shall make p=10 a when p and as are indefinitely small. Hence, expanding in powers of p and a, 1 4 C-1 I1-+-1 and the Law of Dissection of the earth's crust is expressed by the equation Cos (2%+4i) 4 *n {I I\ 21 * * * * * * . (3.) This reduces the formula (2.) to the following :-Attraction of mass standing on any compartment =T4l esin 2PAk (4.) which depends simply upon the average height (I) of the surface of the mass above the surface through A, and not at all upon the distance of the compartment from A. 20. It is in this that the remarkable simplicity of the method consists. We have but to calculate the angles from the Law of Dissection (3.), and lay down the circles and the lines diverging from A upon a good map on which the elevations and depressions are marked, and the attractions of the several masses standing on the compartments thus marked out will be given by the formula (4.) at once, when we determine upon their average elevations. 21. Let D be the mean density of the earth, which has been finally fixed at 5*66 of distilled water by the recent experiments of the late Mr. BAILY; r the radius of the earth = 4000 miles ; g the measure of gravity; then 4 .x g= 3 r D3 HIMALAYAS ON THE PLUMB-LINE IN INDIA. 65 Hence formula (4). becomes,-Attraction of mass standing on any one compartment D sin -f.h 21 D 2 I p .1 ,4 _7 sin-.-.g 7D 2r Let h be expressed in parts of a mile; ? being the density of the superficial crust of the earth, we shall take =2 75, which is the density assigned to the mountain Schehallien; reducing to numbers, we have Attraction of mass standing on any one compartment -0000005523 xh sin2g. .g.(5.) This gives the attraction of each mass in terms of gravity. 22. We may from this easily deduce the deflection of the plumb-line caused by the attraction of the mass; for the tangent of deflection evidently equals the expression (5.) divided by g, by the simple law of the resolution of forces. Hence 1 Tangent of deflection = 0000005523 X h sin P 2 1 -tan (I "1392) x h sin -3; Deflection of the plumb-line caused by the mass standing on any one compartment -1" 1392 h sinI-. . . . . . . . . .

The equation which expresses the law cannot be solved directly; we must therefore resort to approximation or trial. All pairs of values we thus find for M and p must satisfy the equation expressing the law.

In short, we must see that the angle w in art. 14. is suffi. ciently small to be neglected in the formula therein deduced. If it be not, we must calculate the attraction of the nearer masses by a direct method.

Let, as before, the mass be divided by lunes, which for the parts now under consideration must be narrow; let w and wt be the angles which the highest and lowest points of a small vertical prism, reaching from any point of the surface down to the sea-level, makes with the horizontal line at the eye of the observer. Let 9 be the horizontal distance from the observer of the middle line of the prism, in degrees; 3 the width of the lune, in degrees; I the length of the compartment on which the prism stands, in miles; r the radius of the earth, in miles. Then the Lemma in art. 13. leads to the following exact formula 68 ARCHDEACON PRATT ON THE ATTRACTION OF THE 26. That the formula (8.) which I have been using to determine these values does not, thus far, lead to material error may be shown by substituting the 42nd pair of values in thetest given by formula (7.). In this case o&=38S"86, (p 40?314, 2 o+4 =20? 50=20? 30', and formula (7.) becomes P=log' r01I0379639 I 95443253 20(5822892 > 19-9431752 / 0,6391140J =40.356. Hence the error=40?356-40?314=00?042, and this equals 1T rd of the whole. If the same test be applied to the 40th values of a and p, the error is only 3-1th of the whole; and as we pass further back it becomes absolutely evanescent. 27. The remaining values of a and p, after the 42nd as above determined, we must find by solving equation (3.) by trial and testing the values by formula (7.).

So also as 0 is never made larger than 1?, or so large, in the application of this formula, cos ! 0 may be put = 1; and the formula becomes 2 Horizontal attraction of the prism on the station of the observer -=3 p e (sin w + sin w'). 4 Df 1 80 _r The values of I need not follow any law, but may be chosen in each lune according to the form of the vertical section; some values being long and some short, according as the variations of w and WI are slow or rapid. The angles w and w' must be found as follows :-The lune having been divided into compartments, the average height and depth of the top and bottom of the prism standing on each compartment, above and below the observer's horizon, must be divided by the horizontal distance of the prism from the observer. This will give the tangents of the angles cv and w', whence the sines may be found. The above expression must be thus calculated for all the compartments: the whole added together gives the attraction of the mass standing on the portion of the lune to which this method is to be applied. This sum, multiplied by the cosine and sine of the azimuth, will give the attraction in the meridian and in the prime vertical. The same being done all round the circle, the resultant attraction and the azimuth of the plane are easily found; whence the deflection is known, and the various angles of observation may be corrected. In using the method of the text for the parts beyond, the heights kkh2.....nmust be measured from the sealevel, and not from the surface, parallel to the sea-level, passing through the station of the observer. This is done in the text in the case of Kaliana, because it appears that below the level of that place there are no variations of surface sufficient to produce any sensible alteration in the attraction of the whole mass. This, howevter, will not be the case with stations in the mountains.

This, it will be observed, is the same whatever be the height of the station of observation. In fact, the horizontal attraction of the mass, situated so far off as 50 miles and more, upon any station, even though in the mountains, cannot differ in any appreciable degree from that upon the point where the vertical line at the station cuts the sealevel below.

But this is less than O,50 as above determined. Hence p50 will reach, as I have said, beyond the antipodes. The reason why the compartments increase in length with such excessive rapidity when they are more than 900 from A, is, not only the increasing distance of the attracting mass, but their convergency towards the antipodes and the consequent contraction of their width, and also the great angle at which the attraction acts with the tangent at A, and the consequent smallness of its resolved part along that line. 28.

These distances should be laid down and the circles drawn on a map or globe; and nothing remains to be done, but to ascertain the average heights of the masses standing on the compartments thus drawn. If the surface of any of these masses is very irregular, several vertical sections should be taken in directions most favourable for giving a fair average. OQe convenient method of using such sections is, after laying them down on a scale on good paper, to cut them. out, weigh them, and compare the weight with that of a portion of the samne kind of paper of known dimensions on the same scale. The resulting number divided by the aggregate length of all the sections will give the average height. It may be convenient to use different scales for the vertical and horizontal measures: this may be done if it be carefully attended to in carrying out this method. 30. It will be evident that mountain ranges will assume a less importance in this calculation as they are more distant from A, since they will stand on a larger compartment; and therefore when in imagination levelled down to cover the whole compartment and give the average height, they will stand at a much less altitude. It is for this reason that a knowledge of extensive table-lands of considerable elevation, and of the elevated channels of rivers, is of far more importance in this calculation-especially in the remoter parts-than of mountain peaks and mountain ridges. II. Approximation to the amount of mountain attraction at the two extremities and the middle station of the Great Indian Arc of the Meridian between latitudes 180 3' 15" and 290 30' 48". 31. The complete application of the method I have developed requires a full survey of the earth's superficies. In the absence, however, of sufficiently accurate and extensive information to make an exact calculation, I propose now to use such data as I have been able to gather-chiefly from books on geography and HUMBOLDT S works, as well as the -published Maps of the Indian Survey-to obtain an approximation to the amount of attraction on the plumb-line on the Indian arc. I regret that absence from India-which is the occasion of my finding leisure to draw up this paper-prevents my consulting HUMBOLDT'S Map of Central Asia (published in 1842), although extracts from his 'Aspects of Nature' will in part supply the want. 32. Fig. 4 represents an outline of the continent of Asia. A, B, C are the northern, middle, and southern stations of the Great Arc I am about to consider. These stations are Kaliana in latitude 290 30' 48", Kalianpur in 240 7' 11"., and Damargida in 180 3' 15". The longitude of the arc is about 770 42'. The polygonal figure DEFGHIJKLD, which for the convenience of a name I shall call the EnclosedSpace, marks out the boundary of an irregular mass, which is the only part of the earth's surface that appears to have a sensible effiect on the plumbL 2 72 ARCHDEACON PRATT ON THE ATTRACTION OF THE line in India. DEF is the Himalaya range, having a bend at E from north-west on the left to east by south on the right. FG is a range running to the table-land of Yu-nan in lat. 250 and long. ]03?. GH is the range of the Yun-Ling mountains in which there are many peaks of perpetual snow. HI is the Inshan range. IJ is the Khing-Khan range, very steep on the east side, not so on the west: the passes are said to be 5525 feet above the sea. JK is the Altai range, the highest peak of which is 10,800 feet, the average height is 6000: the range declines towards the east. KL was once thought to be a range of mountains, but it is now found to be Fig. 4. // I~~~~~~~A ThinoSC iA if a / w ~edoooi|N l~en-IllzeTL 1:fifzq lk 2 a line of broken country. LD is the Bolor range, rising to an elevation similar to that of the Hindoo Koosh. There are, besides these, two ranges of high mountains running east into the Enclosed Space, parallel to the Altai and Southern Himalayas, viz. LM, the Thian-Schan range, or Celestial Mountains, and NP the Kuen-Luen range, being a continuation of the Hindoo Koosh, which rises from an altitude of 2558 feet near Herat to about 20,000 near N, where it meets the Bolor range. It is with the elevation of the Enclosed Space itself that we are principally concerned, HIMALAYAS ON THE PLUMB-LINE IN INDIA. 73 since, as observed in art. 30, ranges of mountains have not so important an influence, when distant, as table-lands of elevation. 33, Before describing the country within these limits, I will give a general sketch of the parts which lie outside, from; which it will appear that we may confine our calculations to this Enclosed Space. As the elevation of the Station A. is about 1000 feet above the level of the sea, we shall take at this height the surface of reference parallel to the sea-level from which all altitudes are to be measured in our calculations. The stations Kalianpur and Damargida are higher than Kaliana. In making the Kaliana-level our basis, while we consider A to be the station Kaliana itself, B and C must be considered to be points vertically below Kalianpur and Damargida and situated on the Kaliana-level. So that our calculation of the attraction at the middle and south end of the arc will strictly speaking apply to these points. The difference, however, of the attraction at these points and the stations under which they lie will be utterly inappreciable, unless the country around B and C, which we have left out of the account as having no sufficient elevation, produce a sensible effect*. 34. HUMBOLDT says in his ' Aspects of Nature' that to the lowlands belong almost the whole of Northern Asia to the north-west of the volcanic range of the ThianSchan, the steppes to the north of the Altai and of the Sayan range, the countries which extend from the mountains of Bolor or Bulyt-Tagh, from the upper Oxus to the Caspian, and from Tenghir or the Balkhash Lake through the Kirghis steppe,towards the sea of Aral and southern extremity of the Ural Mountains. "As compared," he adds, " with high plains of 6000 and 10,000 feet above the level of the sea, it may well be permitted to use the expression lowlands for flats of little more than 200 to 1200 feet of elevation." Again, "c the plains through which the upper Irtish flows [rising near K in fig. 4 and running north towards the north sea] are scarcely raised 850, or at most 1170 feet above the level of the sea." The mountains about the river Aldan on the north-east and the Ural Mountains to the north-north-westthe former not averaging more than 2000 feet in height, and the latter 4000-can have no influence owing to their great distance, as well as small elevation. In short, the whole country to the north, northwest, and north-east of the Enclosed Space is of so inconsiderable a height above the sea, that it may be left out of our reckonings. The same may be said, of all to the west. Thus Sir ALEXANDER BURNES assigns to Bokhara an elevation of only 1190 feet. The level of the Caspian is 83 feet below the Black Sea, and is the centre of an extensive depression-the Caucasus excepted. The lIindoo Koosh runs off at N. a short distance to the west, but soon descends into the generally-plain country, and at Herat is only 2558 feet high. The only * The actual heights above the sea are thus given in Colonel EVEREST'S work:Height of Kaliana above the sea ........ 942-3 feet. Height of Kalianpur above the sea ...... 1878-2 feet. Height of Damargida above the sea, ......................... 2O9O C5 feet. 74 ARCHDEACON PRATT ON THE ATTRACTION OF THE great elevations in these parts are the Hindoo Koosh and the Caucasus; but these are of so small an extent and width, that when levelled down they will not sensibly raise the average height of the large compartments in which they stand. In Arabia I believe there are some moderately elevated table-lands. But their effect will be somewhat lessened by the intervening ocean, as its density is only two-fifths that of rock. Moreover the effect will be sensible, if sensible at all, only in the direction of the prime-vertical at the three stations, and not in the meridian, which is the only direction of importance to our calculation. The effect is also in part counterbalanced by those parts of the countries of Burmah, Malacca, Siani, and China, which lie outside the Enclosed Space, and are on the opposite side of the Indian Arc from Arabia. The effect of the Ghat Mountains on the west of India, and the table-land of Central and Southern India, will be counteracted in part by the extensive ocean beyond them. Their effect upon the northern Station A. will be inconsiderable; and with regard to B. and C., what effect they may have will be chiefly in the prime-vertical. So to the east of the Enclosed Space. The parts of China beyond it, in which there is only a mountain range on the sea-coast and of no considerable elevation or extent, will have but a feeble influence. Hence these regions around the Enclosed Space may be left out of the account. And those lying still further off and running to the antipodes may also be passed over, as the distance of their several parts is so great compared with the distances of A, B, and C from each other, that the resultant attraction of those regions, whatever high table-lands may occur in them, must be almost precisely the same at all three of the stations. It would not be difficult indeed to show that this resultant attraction is itself of imperceptible amount. We may fairly conclude, then, that the 'disturbing cause lies wholly in the enormous mass included within the Enclosed Space, which I shall now describe. 35. The Himalayas rise abruptly from the plains of India to 4000 feet and more, and cover an extensively broken surface some 100 or 200 miles wide, rising to great heights,perhaps 200 summits exceeding 18,000 feet, and the greatest reaching more than 28,000. The general base on which these peaks rest rises gradually to 9000 or 10,000 feet, where it abuts on the great plateau north of the range. The character of the country to the south of this plateau is much better known than that to the north. If a circle be drawn around A with a radius =5?`046 (the value of a,21), it will pass over the highest part of this plateau, just taking in Leh or Ladak within its compass. The general features of the country within this circle may be learnt from the Survey and other maps of Ildia. This portion, then, of the Enclosed Space I shall call the Known Region, and the whole that lies beyond it the Doubtful Region. By introducing an arbitrary factor into the calculations I shall be able to separate the effects of these two divisions, and to gather what influence our uncertainty in the Doubtful Region has upon the total result. 36. These two divisions join on the great plateau. On this plateau are H'Lassa, according to HUMBOLDT 9590 feet alove the sea; Gertrope, 10,500; and Leh or HIMALAYAS ON THE PLUMB-LINE IN INDIA0 75 Ladak, 9995; but this last is "'in a hollow, the surrounding plateau rising to 13,430 feet." Iskardo is 6300 feet; but "'south of Iskardo the plateau Deotsuh rises to 11,977 feet." "There are, properly speaking," HUMBOLDT observes, "; very few plains [in~this part of the Enclosed Space now under consideration]; the most considerable are those between Gertope, Daba, Schang-thung, the native country of the shawl goat, and Shipke (10,450 feet),-those around Ladak, which have an elevation of 13,430 English feet, and [as noticed above] must not be confounded with the depression in which the town is situated,-and lastly, the plateau of the sacred lakes of Manasa and Ravanahrada (probably 15,000 feet) ...... From many carefully collected measurements of elevation I think I may say," he adds, " that the plateau of Thibet, between 730 and 850 east longitude, does not reach a mean height of 1800 toises, or 1 1,51 0 English feet." In addition to these observations, I may add, that the Survey Map of India, No. 65, shows that the bed of the Sutledge at the point marked S in fig. 4 is 10,792 feet. As the result of these data, I shall take the elevation of the dotted line QR, marked in fig. 4, and passing through Leh and H'Lassa, to be 10,000 feet, the greater portion being i 11,000 or more, and the extremities somewhat less. This will be rather under the mark than above it. 37. With regard to the parts of the Enclosed Space further removed, HUMBOLDT observes,-" ,The mean height of this part of Gobi [between the sources of the river Selenga, lat. 500, long. 1020, and the great wall of China, 600 geographical miles] is barely 4,264 English feet ...... Enghi is half-way, and is only about 2558 feet." I shall therefore take the point M, which represents the situation of Enghi, to be 2560 feet. I gather from the general account of the country between the great plateau of Thibet and the parts about Enghi and beyond that place, that, although it varies in its surface, it has a general slope down to Enghi, and then a rise again to the mountains. In describing the parts to the north of NP, the Kuen-Luen range, HUMBOLDT states, that between that and the Thian-Schan ranges there is a considerable depression. "CARL ZIMMERMAN," he remarks, " has made it appear extremely probable, that the Tarim depression, that is, the desert between the mountain chains of Thian-Schan and Kuen-Luen, where the steppe-river Tarim-gol empties itself into the Lake of Lop, which used to be described as an Alpine lake, is hardly 1279 English feet above the level of the sea." Again, he informs us that the line KL (in fig. 4), though once supposed to be a chain of mountains, is a line of broken country; and the west of this line we know to be lowland. 38. Guided, then, by such data as I have been able to gather, I assume, as the best general representation of the facts, that the Doubtful Region of the Enclosed Space to the north of QR, and outside the circle about A which bounds the Known Region, slopes gradually from 10,000 feet down to 2560 at M, and then rises again at the same angle to J. And I shall assume that the parts of the same region to the south of QR, and not included in the Known Region, slopes at four times that rate. In 76 ARCHDEACON PRATT ON THE ATTRACTION, OF THE fig. 5 1 have laid down the Enclosed Space on a scale, and, for convenience of reference, drawn parallel lines over the whole of the Doubtful Regionl, marking the elevations of the various parts according to the assumed law. Fig. 5. 0,~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~t 39. The width of the lunes by which the enclosed space is to be traversed I shall make 3O0, as this will lead to no material error by making the compartments too wide to obtain a fair average of their height (see art. 16.). In a closer approximation, however, it would be desirable to make the lunes more numerous and narrower. At each of the station's A, B, C, I shall make the middle line of one lune coincide with the meridian. On the right and left limits of the Enclosed Space there will be lunes of a less width than 300. In short, the lunes will be as follows:At A, lune. I., width 3=24? azimuth of middle line =27? west. At A, lune II., width /=300, azimuth of middle line = 00. At A, lune III., width P=300, azimuth of middle line =30? east. At A, lune IV., width /3=300, azimuth of middle line =60? east. At A, lune V., width (3=20?, azimuth of middle line =85? east. HIMALAYAS ON THE PLUMB-LINE IN INDIA. 77 These will take in the whole Enclosed Space, both Known and Doubtful Regions. In like manner for the other stations At B, lune I., width i= 80, azimnuth of middle line =190 west. At B, lune II., width (3=30?, azirnuth of middle line = 0?. At B, lune III., width j3=30?, azimuth of middle line =300 east. At B, lune IV., width 13=300, azimuth of middle line =60? east. At B, lune V., width 03=10', azimuth of middle line =800 east. At C, lune I., width P3=300, azimuth of middle line = 0?. At C, lune II., width 13=300, azimuth of middle line =300. At C, lune III., width if=20?, azimuth of middle line =550 east. 40. By spherical trigonometry and an examination of the maps the following results have been obtained, from which it will be seen which of the quantities ho0/4 14 .... in the several lunes fall within the Enclosed Space (and therefore have any sensible effect), and which in the surrounding low country. STATION A. In tune I., from h, to h120 occur in Known Region, from h20 to h1, in Doubtful Region. In June II., from h4 to h20 occur in Known Region, from h2l to h35 in Doubtful Region. In lune III., from 12 to h20 occur in Known Region, from h2l to h37 in Doubtful Region. In lune IV., from 1, to h20 occur in Known Region, from h2, to h40 in Doubtful Region. In lune V., from h1 to h20 occur in Known Region, from h2, to h34 in Doubtful Region. STATION B. In tune I., only 1127 occurs in Known Region, from h28 to 134 in Doubtful Region. In lune IL., from 123 to h27 occur in Known Region, from 129 to h37 in Doubtful Region. In lune III., from 122 to h126 occur in Known Region, from 127 to 139 in Doubtf7l Region. In lune IV., none occur in Known Region, from h27 to h39 in Doubtful Region. In tune V., none occur in Known Region, from h32 to h,. in DQubtful Region. STATION C. In lune I., from h30 to h133 occur in Known Region, from h34 to h40 in Doubtful Region. In tune II., none occur in Known Region, from132 to 140 in Doubtful Region. In tune III., none occur in Known Region, from h33 to h38 in Doubtful Region. 41. The following is the method I have pursued to determine the heights of the masses standing on the successive compartments which fall within the Known and Doubtful Regions. For the Known Region, I marked out the lunes and their middle lines upon the Survey Maps, and such others as I could procure for regions beyond themn, by stretching threads upon them;, and for the Doubtful Region I used my own diagram, fig. 5, where maps were not available. I then marked on a slip of paper for each map or diagram, according to the scale of each, the distances from the PMDCCCLV. Mt 78 ARCHDEACON PRATT ON THE ATTRACTION OF THE attracted station of the middle points of the compartments of each lune, these distances being taken from the third column of numbers in art. 25 and 28. By laying the slip along the middle line of the lune, with one end at the station, with the greatest ease I dotted down on the map the centres of the compartments, and then by an inspection of the heights, recorded on the map, of ranges and especially of the beds of rivers, determined the average height of the mass on each compartment above the level of Station A. In using the diagram fig. 5, I counted the number of centres of compartments which occur, and marked the heights of the first and last lying on the slope, whence by summing an arithmetic series I obtained the sum of the whole heights, without taking the trouble of noting each of them down. The result of these measures is given in the following Tables. H. and H2 represent the sums of the heights in miles in the Known and Doubtful Regions. The line E at the bottom of each gives the correction which should be applied to the values of H sin 2 p cos Az, in any given lune, for either the Known or Doubtful Region, if the heights in that lune are all increased or diminished by 100 feet.

And the values of the deflections atB and C bear a far higher ratio to those at A than has been generally supposed. For even Kaliana was selected by Colonel EvEREsT in the expectation that it would be beyond the sensible influence of mountain attraction; whereas even at C the deflection in the meridian=6" 909, if the heights have been rightly assigned in this approximation. In the following articles I shall examine these values more minutely, and consider the effect of various hypotheses for reducing them. In the mean time I will write down the following results from these values for the deflections: 0 ? Total deflection at A=32 601, and in azimuth . . 31 18 East Total deflection at B=12-880, and in azimuth . . . 21 42 East Total deflection at C= 7A426, and in azimuth . . . . 21 31 East* 44. In attempting to reduce the amount of deflection deduced by these calculations, the first thought that comes to mind is, that the density of the'attracting mass may have been chosen too large. J have made it 2-75 of distilled water, which is that which was assigned as the mean density of the mountain Schehallien in the calculations of MASKELYNE. This can harcdly be too great; for, as I shall soon show, a very large share of the deflection is produced by the attraction of the elevated plateau which lies in Thibet and south of that country; and as this is on an average 10,000 feet or more high, the lower part of the materials must be denser rather than lighter than those of a mountain of inconsiderable altitude. If, however, we do reduce the density, say to 2#25, which is yielding much, still the deflections and their differences are reduced by only one-fifth part, and therefore this will not solve the difficulty. 45. The next thought is, that I mav have assigned too great a mass to the Doubt* Some idea may be formed of the amount of these deflections from the following representation. Conceive three hemispherical mountains of granite to exist close to the three stations A, B, C,, their bases being horizontal and just coming up to the stations, and the centres of the bases bearing respectively 310 18% 210 421' 21? 31t east of the north meridian. That the horizontal attraction of these hemispherical mountains on the plumb-line at the three stations may be equal to the attration of the Himalayas and the regions beyond, the diameters of their bases must be respectively 6, 2, 1+ miles very nearly. -MDCCCLV. N 86 ARCHDEACON PRATT ON THE ATTRACTION OF THE ful Region. This I will now examine. All the results which depend upon this part I will multiply by a factor 1 -x. If x=0, the results will stand as they do now. If x=1, this will amount to supposing the mass standing on the whole Doubtful Region to be non-existent, an hypothesis clearly impossible. By giving x any intermediate fractional value we shall be supposing that all the heights, and therefore the whole mass, are reduced in that ratio. Let A, B, C represent the deflections in meridian at the three stations A, B, and C. Then from art. 42. we gatherA=12'972+(1-x) 14881 =27X85314X881 x B= 3X219+(1 x) 8X749 -119688X749 x C= 1X336+(1-x) 5 573 6'9095 573x; A -B =15'8856X132 x A-C=20X9449X308 x B-C= 5'0593 176x. These show that the extravagant hypothesis of supposing x 1, or that the whole mass on what we have called the Doubtful Region is non-existent, will not reduce the difference of deflections at A and B lower than 9"753, which is greater than 5"'236 in the ratio of 13: 7. Nor will this even come down sufficiently if we reduce also the density of the remaining mass, that on the Known Region. 46. A third means of reduction may be looked for in the Known Region. By examining the results gathered together in art. 42, it will be seen that the chief part of the meridian attraction of the mass on the Known Region arises from the lunes II. III. and IV. for A, and lunes II. and III. for B. By attentively examining these columns in Tables I. and III. in art. 41, we see that a large portion of the attraction arises from the Great Plateau. The result I arrive at is, that of the deflection 12" 972 at A, as much as 8"772 arises from this plateau; and of the 3" 219 at B, as much as 2" 010 arises from the same cause. Hence if 1 -y be an arbitrary factor, A (Known Region)=4'200+(1 -y) 81772 B (Known Region)=1,209+(Iy) 2 010 AB (Known Region) =2'991 + (1 -y) 6'762. It will be necessary, then, to cut down the height of the plateau as much as 6000 feet, to make this come down to 5" 236; or, if we suppose that all the heights in the other part of the Known Region are twice too large, and if we therefore replace 2"1 991 by its half, 1" 496, even then y must equal 0,55, and the elevation of the plateau* above the sea be reduced from 10,000 feet to 6000 feet. And all this in addition to the hypothesis of the non-existence of the whole mass on the Doubtful Region! * I should mention to what extent I assume that this plateau is comprised within what I havre called the Known Region. Let four points be marked down on the map, viz. WV in lat. 340 and long. 76?, X in lat. 320 45f HIMALAYAS ON THE PLUMB-LINE IN INDIA. 87 It appears, in short, to be quite hopeless by any admissible hypothesis to reduce the calculated deflection so as to make it tally with the error brought to light by the Survey. -In the conclusion of this-paper, however, it will appear that such a reduction is not necessary for reconciling the discrepancy. 47. I will here write down the formulae in their most general shape. Let 1 -z be a factor (similar to 1 -x and -y) for the part of the Known Region not including the Plateau. Suppose also the whole of the heights of the Known Region are reduced by a hundreds of feet, and those of the Doubtful Region by b hundreds (in this way I bring in the correction E at the foot of the six Tables). Then A=(1z)4"-200+(1 -y)8"1'772+(1-x)14!h881 0 312a-(0"h260b. B=(l z) 209+( 1 ~-y)2"010+(1 -x) 8"`749-0" 059a-0"1586. C=(1-z)0" 729+ (1 -y)0"607+ (1 -x) 5"-573-0"'022a-0" 1oob. The method of using these arbitrary symbols is this. If it appear on examining the contour of the earth's surface more carefully, that the heights in the Known Region and south of the space I call the Plateau, ought to be reduced in a certain ratio, we have but to give the value of that ratio to z: the same is the case, as I have already shown, with y and the Plateau itself. If, on the other hand, we do not wish to reduce the heights in the Known Region in a certain ratio, but by the same given quantity, z and y must be put 0, and a= the number of hundreds of feet by which we wish to reduce. Thus if we wish to reduce the whole Known Region by 1 000 feet in altitude, we must put a=10. We may, moreover, combine these methods of reduction, and both reduce the general ratio of the heights, and afterwards cut these reduced heights down by a constant quantity by giving z, y, and a theproper values. The same things may be done for the Doubtful Region by assigning proper values to x and b: so that the formulae here given admits of adaptation to various hypotheses of reduction. 48. We may use these last formulke for comparing the masses which stand on the Known and Doubtful Regions with each other, and with the mass of the earth. In doing this I shall suppose that the heights have been rightly assigned in the present paper. Therefore z=O, y=O, x= 0. Then if a=4158, the part of A which arises from the Known Region is reduced to zero. Hence 4158 feet is the average height of the mass standing on that part. In the same manner, by making b=57 30, the part of A which arises from the Doubtful Region vanishes; and therefore the average height of the whole mass standing on-that portion of the Enclosed Space is 5730 feet. It will be observed that this is greater than the former. The obvious reason of this is, that the mass of the Known Region is highest at its furthest parts from A, whereas the reverse is the case with the mass of the Doubtful Region. The superficial extent of each and long. 760 451, Y in lat. 300 30' and long. 800, and Z in lat. 310 30' and long. 830. Join W and Z by a circle about Kaliana as centre, and join these and the other points by arcs of great circles of the sphere. I take the average height of the enclosed mass to be 10,000 feet above the sea, a mean altitude which I conceive is rather under than over the mark. N 2 Ss ARCHDEACON PRATT ON THE ATTRACTION OF THE of these two regions is found by the following formula of spherical trigonometry:Area of portion of a lune 7rj3r2 . = -0 (sin a,,-sin a.), the portion being bounded by arcs of great circles at distances am and M. from A, 3 the angle of the lune expressed in degrees, and r being the radius of the earth. The values of atm and a. for the several lunes are obtained from arts. 40. and 25. The results are, that the superficial extents of the Known and Doubtful Regions equal respectively 0 1679616 r2 and 0'7555430 r2 square miles, r=4000; and therefore putting the density = half that of the earth's mean density, and the respective heights =4158 feet or 0-7761 mile, and 5730 feet or 1P0852 mile, we have the following results:mass on Known Region 3 0-1679616 x 0'7761 mass of the earth 8r r = 0'000003890 mass on Doubtful Region 3 0'7555430 x 1'0852 mass of the earth 8 r r =0'000024367. mass on Doubtful Region Hence, also, mass on Known Region 6264, or the mass on the Doubtful Region is greater than that on the Known Region in a ratio higher than 25: 4. Also mass on whole Enclosed Space=000257 mass of the earth 0000028257. 49. By means of this last result we can determine at what distances from A, B, and C, the whole attracting mass must be imagined concentrated in a point, so as to produce the deflections at those three stations found in art. 43. If, instead of multiplying the totals in art. 42. by l"1"392, we multiply them by 0'000005523 g (see art. 21.), we shall have the attractions in terms of gravity. Hence attraction at A in meridian =24'452 X 0000005523g; attraction at A in prime vertical = 15'078 X 0-000005523 g; total attraction on A . . . =2872 XOO000005523g =z0'00015862 g. In the same way I find Total attraction on B . . . =0'00006245 g. Total attraction on C . . . =0'0000360 g. Hence distance from A of point of concentration radius of earth /attracting mass 1 mass of earth X 000015862 A /2 _422; 0V00015862 distance from A of point of concentration =1688 miles HIMALAYAS ON THE PLUMB-LINE IN INDIA. 89 In the same manner it may be shown that distance from B of the point of concentration =2692 miles; distance from C of the point of concentration =3544 miles. The differences of these two last from the first are far greater than the distances of B and C from A, viz. 50 23' 37" and 110 27' 33". From this it is easily inferred, what indeed did not need this proof, that the mass in no sense whatever, even an approximate one, attracts as if concentrated in a fixed point. 'Fig. 6. 50. It is extremely difficult to obtain a simple law y of attraction, even an approximate one, of such a mass as that under consideration. I have, however, arrived at one which appears to represent the facts with a considerable degree of exactness, and by which we can interpolate for the amount of deflection at any station of the arc intervening between Kaliana and Damargida. It depends upon the properties of the curve of which a4 the equation is y2= -x2. Let Ax, Ay be the axes of X and y, and Qaq be the curve; the axis of y is an asymptote, and the curve cuts the axis of x at right A N angles at a distance Aa=a. The property of this curve which I am about to use is as follows. The attraction upon A of any slender prism of matter Qq, parallel to the axis of y and terminated at both ends/ by the curve, is the same as if the mass of the prism were concentrated in the point a. This property is easily demonstrated. For by the process pursued in the proof of the Lemma (art. 13.), it can be shown that the attraction on A of the half prism QM in the direct tion AM mass of QM. AM.AQ| attraction of Qq on A in AM=m -aoQq9 mass of Qq mass of Qq = a= by the equation to the curve. This demonstrates the property. The same, then is true of any line parallel to y: and it follows easily that a mass of the form QRrq and of uniform thickness will attract the point A as if concentrated in a. But more than this; the property is true also for any prisms parallel to y and lying above the plane xty: so that the mass lyring on QRrq need not be of uniform thickness, but may vary in 90 ARCHDEACON PRATT ON THE ATTRACTION OF THE any manner whatever, so long as its height is always small and the same at the same distance from the axis of y. The property, then, in its most general form is this. If a mass lie on the space QRrq,, always of small comparative altitude and having its section perpendicular to the axis of y always the same (so far as it falls within the curve), the section itself being of any conceivable form whatever, then the attraction of the mass on A is precisely the same as if it were concentrated in the point a (I should mention that in drawing the figure I have for convenience made the dimensions in y one-third of the size they should be compared to those of x). 51. In the previous articles we have seen that by far the largest part of the attraction, at the three stations, arises from the elevated regions lying parallel to the line QR in figs. 4 and 5, running from west-north-west to east-south-east. If, then, we take A in the figure of last article to be Kaliana, and Ax in the north-northeast direction, we may make the parts of QRrq nearest A coincide as nearly as possible with the attracting mass of the Himalayas and the regions beyond, by giving the vertical section MN the right form: and the parts of this mass towards the extremities, and therefore furthest from A, will have a less and less effect in the direction Ax, both on account of their increasing distance and the larger angle at which they act with Ax. Hence we can easily conceive that such a form can be given to the transverse section MN as to make the mass on QRrq in its efJJct in the direction Ax a very fair representative of the actual mass, producing the deflection of the plumb-line at Kaliana. This being the case, the property I have demonstrated, together with the result arrived at in art. 49, shows that Aa, or a in the equation to the curve, =1688 miles. 52. By taking different values for a in the curve we may find curves differing in their dimensions, but possessing the same property. Fig. 7. In the accompanying figure (fig. 7) three such curves are drawn having a common HIMALAYAS ON THE PLUMB-LINE IN INDIA. 91 ordinate Pp, so that the three masses on QRrq, Q'R'r'q', and Q"R!'r"q" are of the same length and coincide precisely with each other, except in a very trifling degree at the two extremities. AB'C' are the three attracted points for the three curves: abc are the three points where the attracting mass may be conceived to be concentrated, corresponding respectively to AB'C'. ABC is the meridian through the three stations Kaliana, Kalianpur, and Darnargida. It is evident that the attractions of the mass on A, B, and C, in the direction parallel to Aa, will not differ from the attractions on A, BW and C' by any appreciable quantities. Let Aa=an B'b=-b, C'c=c. By art. 49, we have shown that a=1688 miles, b=2692, c=3544. 1 will now show the consistency of these results, as flowing from the property I have enunciated. The Trigonometrical Survey shows that AB=371 miles, and BC= 430. AB makes 22?l with AB', and cos 220 30'=0,92388. Hence AB'=343 miles, and AC'=740. Taking A as the origin of coordinates, and the axes as before, the equations to the three curves give (Am=x) a 4 Prn2=e _x2, Pm= (x +343)2 (x+343)2 arid Pm( 740) (x+ 740)2. If we put a=1688 and b= 2692 in the first and second of these and equate them, the equation is satisfied by x=222 miles. And when this value of x is put in the equation formed by equating the first and third values Of PM2, we obtain C V962J2168842 2222+9622} =3559 miles. The very close agreement of this result with that obtained from the calculations of this paper, and shown in art. 49. to be 3544 miles, shows how exactly the law here deduced represents the facts of the case. The value of x, viz. 222 miles, places the line Pp on the part we have called the Plateau, running W.N.W. and E.S.E. about thirty miles north of Gertope. 53. The law thus developed by aid of the curve enables us to interpolate the amount of the deflection of the plumb-line at any station of the arc between Kaliana and Damargida. Thus suppose X is the distance of the station from the fixed line Pp. and A the distance of the centre of concentration for that station. Then A4 a4 -X2=Pm, and this 22222, A4 X2 1 (X2-2222)2222] a4=222 + a4 Since X is never greater than 962, and a=1688, the second term within the bracket 92 ARCHDEACON PRATT ON THEB ATTRACTION OF THE will always be an etremely small fraction, which may be neglected; A2 X .*. >22; deflection of plumb-line at proposed station deflection of plumb-line at Kaliana attraction at the station a2 222 attraction at Kaliana A2 X But by art. 43, deflection at Kaliana =321 601; 7237",422 deflection at the station in question = If we had used the second and third values of Pm2 above, we should have obtained from the results for Kalianpur and Damargida given in art. 43., the following:deflection at the station in-question = 7 deflection at the station in question = 7143812 x These three form ulv are very nearly the same. I shall adopt the mean of them;and in taking the mean I shall give the three their respective " weights," which are as the numbers 76, 30, 17, as the deflections in art. 43. show. This leads to the following formula.Deflection of plumb-line, at a station the distance of which from Pp is X miles, l7235"1 54. We may obtain X in terms of the latitude. Let L be the latitude of the place, and I the latitude of Kaliana; then X-222+(I-L) cos 220 301X the number of miles in a degree of latitude at the centre of the indian Arc. The vlue of the multiplier of l-L which best suits my purpose is 63-06465. As this =69 cos 230 56., using this value shows that if the length of a degree in this latitude =69 miles, then the line Pp must run about the one-eighth of a point further from east and west than I have placed it, viz. W.N.W. and E.S.E. If the length of the degree be less than sixty-nine miles, then Pp will need a still smaller shift of position. Substituting the above value, we have deflection at any station of which the latitude is I-L degrees south of Kaliana 7235", 114"`712 63'06465(1-L) +222=-I-L+3-520 If we put I-L=0, 5' 23' 37', and 110 27' 33" corresponding with the latitudes of Kaliana, Kalianpur, and Damargida, this formula gives for the three deflections at those stations 32" 590, 12"-870, and 7"`668. These so nearly accord with the values in art. 43, that the above formula will represent very approximately the deflection at any station on the whole arc. HIMALAYAS ON THE PLUMB-LINE IN INDIA. 93 55. It may easily be shown from the results of the foregoing articles, that the formula above amounts to supposing, that the Himalayas and the regions beyond attract the three stations and all intermediate stations on the arc between Kaliana and Damargida, as a bar of matter would, running about W.N.W. and E.S.E. at a distance of 222 miles from Kaliana, the length of the bar being infinite, its transverse Section small, and its density such that the mass of the Himalayas and attracting regions beyond shall equal the mass of 1284 miles of its length. 56. In order to deduce from this formula for the total deflection the deflection in the meridian, which is the part of most importance, we ought to know the azimuth of the vertical plane in which the total deflection takes place. This is not the same for the three stations A, B, and C. By article 43. it appears that the azimuths at those three stations are 310 18', 210 42', and 210 31'. After various trials I find that the following formula represents the law with sufficient exactness. If 0 be the azimuth (measured from the north), then cosO@= cos310 18' 1 1sin ] O(l-L) When I-L=O, 50 23' 37"1, and 110 27' 33", this gives O=310 18', 210 35' and 19? 58'. This last differs by 1? 33' from the value in art. 43; but the second only by 7'. These are sufficiently near the truth, as the cosine in the extreme case will differ from, the truth by only about Ro-th part. The formula for the azimuth departs most from the truth when I-L=90, that is, at a point about half a degree south of the middle point between Kalianpur and Damargida. But the form of the function is so chosen, that it does not vary much along the whole arc between those stations; and the above-mentioned departure amounts to only one-seventieth part of the proper value. Between Kaliana and Kalianpur I think the formula will represent the azimuth very exactly, and although below that not with the same exactness, yet to a degree of approximation which will introduce no error of importance in the value of the deflection in the meridian. 57. We may show this by combining this formula with that deduced for the total deflection in art. 54. Thus Deflection in: the meridian at any place of which the latitude is 1= total deflection X cosO 114"'712 cos 310 18 -I-L+3,520 1sin1O(l-L) 98"'-016 (1-L +3 520)., -isin 10(1-L)} When I-L=O, 50 23' 37", and 110 27' 33", this gives for the meridian deflections 27"'845, I1"'965, and 7"`207. These quantities, as calculated from the attracting MiDCCCLV. 0 94 ARCHDEACON PRATT ON THE ATTRACTION OF THE mass in art. 43, are 27"`853, 1'V968 and 6"I909, which show how good an approximation the formula of this article gives. 58. Before proceeding to the conclusion of this paper I will gather together the formulae which I have arrived at. The deflections of the plumb-line at Kaliana, Kalianpur, and Damargida have been found to be as follows: In the meridian . 27'-853, 1 1"968, 6`h909 In the prime vertical 16"-942, 4"763, 2`723 Total deflections . 32"601, 12"-880, 7'"-426 In azimuths . . . 310 18' 210 42, 210 31'. The general formula including these results and the deflections for intermediate stations are,114n1712 total deflection=l-L+3*52o and the azimuth in which its acts is given by cosO= 31 I10 sin 10(1-L) . . . . ~~~~98"l 016 deflection in meridian = 32 in--(l-L?+3 52O){1-yO sin 1(-) The formulae for altering the deflections in meridian for any change in the heights of the attracting mass are brought together in art. 47. Similar formulae might easily be calculated for the deflections in the prime vertical. If any change be made in the heights of the attracting mass, these formulae will show what corrections unist be introduced into the expressions for the total deflections and their azimuths given above, and also into the constants in the general formulae. Conclusion. 59. Before an arc can be made use of in the problem of the figure of the earth, we, must know correctly two things concerning it,-its length and its amplitude. Of the two arcs I have been considering, viz. from Kaliana to Kalianpur, and from Kalianpur to Damargida, the correct lengths are known from the Survey; and, as shown in art. 6, these are altogether unaffected by mountain attraction. The same cannot be said of their amplitudes; and till they can be obtained correctly, the arcs can render no service to the great problem. But the amount of deflection in the plumbline caused by mountain attraction having been determined, the amplitudes obtained astronomically may be corrected, and the arcs may take their place-and a very important place, owing to their length and the accuracy of the geodetic operations-in the investigation of the earth's form. 60. When the length and amplitude of an arc are known, the formula which I give HIMALAYAS ON THE PLUMB-LINE IN INDIA. 95 in art. 62. establishes a relation between the two quantities on which the figure of the earth, supposed to be a spheroid of revolution, depends, viz. the semi-axis major and the ellipticity. As there are two quantities to be determined, a single arc is not sufficient to enable us to find them, unless the lengths and amplitudes of portions of the arc, as well as of the whole, are known. BEssEL, in a paper which has been translated in vol. ii. of TAYLOR'S 'Scientific Memoirs,' has shown from ten arcs measured on various parts of the earth and from portions of five of them, by an application of the principle of least squares, that the mean ellipticity _ and that the semi-axis major =3271953,854 toises, the length of the toise being to that of the fathom as 1-06576542 : 1. This result coincides almost exactly with the ellipticity which theory assigns, upon the supposition that the earth was once a fluid mass, its strata increasing in density from the surface to the centre, the density of the surface being that of granite, and the mean density being 51rds that of water-a fact which is generally considered to be a strong argument in favour of the original fluidity of the earth's mass. 61. But by the process described above, the peculiarities of the several arcs are all merged in the mean result. When the calculations for the separate arcs are examined, the values are found to vary on either side of the mean. This variety indicates that the several parts of the earth are not curved precisely according to the same elliptic law. Some may think that this militates against the original fluidity of the earth's mass. I do not think this is a fair inference. If the earth's surface ever were fluid, the science of geology shows us that it must have ceased to be so for many ages: and the interval affords time enough for the operation of that well-established law-that gradual changes of elevation and depression are unceasingly taking place in the surface, arising no doubt from chemical and mineralogical changes in the mass-to modify the original curvature of the various parts, making some greater and others less than before. The argument of the earth's original fluidity lies in the !fact, that the present mean form is that which the earth must have had when it was fluid. 62. I will conclude this paper by calculating the form of the Indian arc between Kaliana and Damargida and its two subdivisions. The result affords, I think, the only explanation of the discordance between the difference of amplitude as brought out in Colonel EvEREST'S work, and by my calculation of the amount of deflection. The lengths of the three arcs, Kaliana-Kalianpur, Kalianpur-Damargida, and their sum, Kaliana--Damargida (which I shall call arcs I., II., 1II.), are shown by the Survey to be 326859,52, 367154-37, and 694013'89 fathoms. From these the amplitudes may be deduced by assuming a form of the meridian. Colonel EVEREST assumes semi-axis major =20922931V8 feet, and ellipticity =300'8 o02 96 ARCHDEACON PRATT ON THE ATTRACTION OF THE The formula for thus calculating the amplitude is derived from the usual relation, arc dl I ,=(1 1-e2)X, I-e sine i}D axis major where I and L are the latitudes of the extremities of the arc, and e is the eccentricity of the ellipse. Let a be the semi-axis major; s the ellipticity; the amplitude of the arc; 4 the latitude of the middle point of the arc. Then e'=2s-s2 A-=I-L, 2p=I+L; and the above form leads to the following, arce / in X i .a -{1-2 ( 1 +3-ACO co2PJ16 2( 1-1 5 ACOSx os 4P)} a { 2 c A ) 1 sin X \21 sin,2_I +-?6((1+3 cos C?2{t +4(1-15 A cos X cos4Pf),J. If the values for arcs I., II., III. and a are put in the expression ae we obtain the three first approximate values of the computed amplitudes of the three arcs. They are 00937324, 0-1052876, and 01990201, or the same expressed in angles are 50 22' 13"t'715, 60 1' 57!h145, and 11? 24' 10Ih869. These must be put in the small terms on the right-hand side of the form for x above, and we have the second approximation to the three values viz.I=5O 23' 41`796, X"=60 3' 53"1286, I "=110 27' 361!300. A third approximation will not affect these results. Now the astronomically determined amplitudes are, as I gather from Colonel EVEREST S work ') 50 23' 37" 058, 60 3' 55" '973, and 1 10 27' 33"i-032. And in art. 43. 1 have found the differences of deflection of the plumb-line at the extremities of the arcs I., I, III., to be 151'%885, 5`059, and 2O'h944. * These will be found at pp. lxx, lxxi. Expressed in seconds they are 19417"t058, 21835"t973, and 41253ft"031. These are the amplitudes, given under the symbol Al in the Table of final results at the close of his work, and which form the data for the comparison of the Indian arc witharcs in other parts of the world, for the determination of the mean ellipticity of the earth. It is obvious that these values of Al are not correct as final data, if mountain attraction is to be taken account of. They should be increased by the differences in deflection in the plumb-line caused by attraction at the extremities of the arcs. HIMALAYAS ON THE PLUMB-LINE IN INDIA. 97 I shall use arbitrary factors with these to give the opportunity of introducing any changes in the deflections that may be thought necessary on a further examination of the contour of the surface of the attracting mass; so that 15" 885(1 -u), 5" 059( 1-v), and 20"`944(1 -w) will be the differences of deflection in the meridian at the extremities of the three arcs I., II., III. As the third of these must be the sum of the other two, we have the relation 20944w= 15 885ut+5 059v, or IV 0'7584u+0 2415v. 63. Also, by comparing the above values of the deflections with those in art. 47, we have the relations u=0 1 883z+0A4257y1+03861 x, v= 0r0949z+0-277V3.q+0 6278x, w-= O 1657z+0 3898y+017044x. 64. Before proceeding, I will remark that the amplitude of thle arc II. determined astronomically, as given above, is somewhat greater than that deduced by calculation from the length of the a1rc. Unless this can be accounted for by the form of the assumned ellipse, it intimates that there is some (listurbing cause north of Damargida which increases the inclination of the plumb-line to that at Kalianpur. Should this be the case, the correction for it may be effected by adding a small quantity to the deflection between Kalianpur and Damargida; that is, by increasing 5"h059(1 -v), or by diminishing v by somne quantity v'. 65. We mIIust uowv add the meridian (leflections to the 'astronlomical amplitudes. The results are the true amplitudes of the three arcs I., II., III., viz.5? 23' 52" '94315"I885u, (60 4' 1'"032-5" 059v, and 1 lO 27' 53"-976 20"'944w.

Put a =M, and substitute the value found above, and this becomes, after reduction, O=tz+O00005739-O0008 179u1 3880dC. In a similar manner we obtain the following equations: O=+o+00003548-()0002317v16095de, O=++00004284-0O0005076w1I5055dg. Eliminating a from the 1st and 2nd, the 1st and 3rd, and the 2nd and 3rd, we lhave the three following equations in de:O=0,0002191-0,0008179u+00(02317v+0 2215ds, o=00001455-0-0008179u+0'0005076w+OI 175de, and 0=00000736+0 0002317v-0,0005076w +0 1040de.

The method of least squares shows that the arithmetic mean of these is the nearest value; ds= (-0O002935+0011080u-0 003138v) =-0 000978+0 003693u-0 001046v. It is worthy of remark, theat the terms depending upon the calculated deflection, viz. those in which u and v enter, are very ilearly exactly the same in the mean value and the three separate values of de. Adding the mean value of ds to ? or I (which equals 0 003324), we have corrected ellipticity =0 002346+0 003693u-0 001046v; and by adding the three equations in a together, substituting for de its iiean value, and dividing by 3, we have = -0'0039737-0 0051426u+0 001688 1v; corrected semi-axis major =a(1 +i) =a{0'9960263-0 0051426u+0 00168SIv). 66. With regard to these results, I will first observe, that if mountain attraction be neglected altogether, or u= 1 and v= 1, ellipticity =0002346+0"003693-00001046 =0 005093_ l96 3. HIMALAYAS ON THE PLUMB-LINE IN INDIA. 99 This value coincides almost exactly with Colonel EVEREST'S determination of the 0 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~1 ellipticity from a comparison of the arcs I. and II. He makes it 6 (see the Table at the end of his work). 67. Let us next see whether, by altering the altitudes of the attracting mass, we can make the curvature of the Indian arc equal to that corresponding with the mean ellipticity. The above form will then give 3007 or 0 003324=0 002346+0 003693u-0'001046v; 3693u 1046v=978 978 + 1046v U= 73693 =0*265+0*283v. As v cannot be less than 0, u cannot be less than 0,265, or somewhat more than to satisfy this equation. Or the heights laid down in the Tables of art. 41. must be so far cut down as to diminish the difference of deflection at Kaliana and Kalianpur by one-fourth of its amount. Should it be necessary to allow for the larger astronomical amplitude of the arc II. (noticed in art. 64.), by diminishing v by a quantity v', then u=0 265-0 283v'+0-283v. The astronomical amplitude of arc II. is 2`687 larger than that obtained by coniputation from the arc; whereas it should be 111*509* smaller than that determined from computation, if it bear the same relation to the difference of deflections as in the arc I. If then we put = 2"687+ 1%''509 4 19608294 u =0*030+0a283v, and a reduction of the difference of deflections at Kaliana and Kalianpur by something more than Wth part, the difference in arc II. remaining unaltered, will bring the ellipticity out 3O07* There is, however, no reason for supposing either that the curvature of the Indian arc is precisely equal to the mean curvature of the whole quadrant; nor that the heights of the attracting masses have been made so much too great. 68. If these heights have been rightly assigned in this paper, that is, if u=0 and v=0, then the ellipticity of the Indian arc =00023461 which shows that the arc is more curved than it would be if it had the mean ellipticity. 100 ATTRACTION OF THE HIMALAYAS ON THE PLUMB-LINE IN INDIA. The degree of increased curvature may be judged of from this. The height of the middle point of an arc of which the amplitude is X, above the chord of the arc, ~a.X-{1 -Q+cos 2() 8 { 2 2 a p being the latitude of the middle point, and X sufficiently small to allow X4 to be neglected. In the arc between Kaliana and Damargida (which is about 800 miles long), X=0-2, cos 2p=0'67473, and a=4000 wiles. Hence height of middle point above the chord =20(1 1-512s) miles. For the mean ellipticity, this = 19'8992, miles. I1 For the ellipticity 3 this = 19'9290 miles. For the ellipticity this,= 19'8460 miles. The ellipticity, therefore, which results from taking account of mountain attraction raises the middle point of the arc by 0-0298 of a mile, or 157 feet; whereas the ellip.. ticity when mountain attraction is neglected depresses the are through 0,0532 of a mile, or 281 feet. These quantities are nearly in the ratio of 5: 9. Hence the consideration given to mountain attraction in this paper brings the curvature of the Indian arc nearer to the mean curvature than the neglect of mountain attraction does in the ratio of 5: 9 '. This is, as far as it goes, in favour df these calculations. 69. The conclusion, then, to which I come is, that there is no way of reconciling the difference between the error in latitude deduced in Colonel EVEREST'S work and the amount I have assigned to deflection of the plumb-line arising from attractionand which, after careful re-examination, I am decidedly of opinion is not far from the truth, either in defect or in excess-but by supposing, that the ellipticity which Colonel EVEREST uses in his calculations, although correct as a mean of the whole quadrant, is too large for the Indian arc. This hypothesis appears to account for the difference most satisfactorily. The whole subject, however, deserves careful examination; as no anomaly should, if possible, remain unexplained in a work conducted with such care, labour, and ability, as the measurement of the Indian arc has exhibited. * An increased curvature is, moreover, more in accordance with what might be expected, as the effect of the upheaving of the enormous mass of the Himalayas and neighbouring regions, than a diminished curvature.
