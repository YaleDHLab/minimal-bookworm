Mr. MARSDEN'S Correction of an Er.195ofthe cell, which is seldom done with wa:x alones but with a mixture; arld they sometimes cover the silk lining of the last chrysalis; but all this 1nakes such cells clumsy, in colnparison to the original ones. To CHARLES BLAGDEN, M. D. Sec. R. S. DEAR SIR IN a Paper on the Chronology of the HINDOOS, which the Society did lne the honour to pritlt in tlle LXXXth Volulne of their Transactions, I have said (p. S66 and 570) that the era of Bikrolmajit comlmences in the year 56 before Christ, and that tTle year 1846 corresponds with our year 1790 (frotn April) : but it appears frorn an examination of the nutubers of an original Benares allnanack, that I have calculated the elapsed time of that er-a one year short (by comparison with the era of Salab in, xrllicl1 being employed in astronomical computations is sufficiently ascertained), and that the year 184,7 not 184,6> bsh-ould correspond with 1790, and the columencement of the era with the year 57 before Christ, both from April. I tdS very desirous that this trror should be noticed as soon as possible, and request that the correction may have a place in the Volume nosv printiIlgo I am, dear Sir, &ce WM. M4RSDEN.
