NOTE, AT the end of p. 2125. the Reader is desired to add, to prevent all mistakes,what the Author of that Letter signified April 21.1671.to the Publisher since that was Printed, viz. That in a very sharp Frost the Bleeding is stop'd till the weather begins to change; but in a moderate Frost,though it stop in the night, yet in the day time, if the Sun shines out, the Trees will bleed, though the Frost continue. What we said in our Letter, Printed No.57.p. 1166.l.45. that Cold did not promote but hinder bleeding; we find holds true, if the Cold be without Frost. Besides, p.2126. at the end of Mr.Willoughby's Letter may be added, what he further imparted in the above said Letter of Apr. 21. viz. That since his last, he had made tryal upon Walnut and Sycamore as to the transmitting of Water, and found, that the water runs through both but nothing so fast as thorough Birch.
