XI. Extract of a Letter from Monsieur de Bremond, M. D. to Dr. Mortimer, concerning a File rendered Magnetical by Lightning. Translated from the French by T. S. M. D. F. R. S. IN No 437. of the Philosophical Transactions you have published, Sir, a Letter of Dr. Cookson, of Wakefield, on an extraordinary Effect of Lightning, which communicated Magnetism to several Iron Tools I have received a Letter from the Coast of St. Andre in Dauphine, dated Sept. 7. 1739. giving an Account of a Fact of the same Nature, which I here send you as I received it. ``Three Weeks ago the Lightning fell 30 Paccs ``from my House on that of a Clock-maker. I shall ``not enter into the Particulars of the Ravage it ``committed. Every-body knows how surprising ``the Effects of Thunder are: But here is one that is ``very singular. The Thunder broke one of the ``Clock-maker's Files, four Inches from the End; ``so that there still remained Seven Inches of it in the ``Handle; [615] `` Handle; and the Piece of Four Inches long, that `` was broke off, remained on the Shop-board. `` The next Day after the Accident, the Clock`` maker, observing that the remaining Part of this `` File might still be of Service to him, took it up, `` and worked with it. But he was much surprised `` to see, that Iron followed the End of his broken `` File. He applied this End to a Punch (or Drill), `` and the Punch was immediately attracted to the `` File. He called to me, and I made several Trials `` of this attractive Quality. I took the Piece of the `` File that had been broken off, and applied it to an `` iron Ring for hanging Keys; which it lifted up `` perfectly well, and held suspended as long as I `` thought proper. I doubted not but it was the `` Lightning that had communicated a magnetic Qua`` lity to this File; and I found, upon Trial, that this `` Quality was given only to the Inside of the File, `` and the broken Piece; for I applied Bits of Iron to `` every Side of it, without any Effect, the Virtue `` residing no-where but in the Place that was broken. `` I broke in two the same Piece of Four Inches; and `` one of the Two Pieces attracted Iron at both Ends, `` the other only at its broken End. I rubbed the `` Point of my Knife on one of these two Bits of `` the File, and it communicated to my Knife a De`` gree of Magnetism sufficient to raise Needles, and `` hold them suspended. '' I wish, Sir, this Observation may prove agreeable to you: It will serve at least to multiply the odd Effects of Lightning, and the Wonders of Magnetism. I ~ [616] I have the Honour to be with all possible Esteem and Respect, S I R, Your most humble and Paris, June 4. N. S. 1740. most obedient Servant, De Bremond, of the Royal Academy of Sciences.
