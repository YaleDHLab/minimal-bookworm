This Computation is made from Tables * which give the ascending Node of Mercury at the Time of this Transit 6~ 17~ too forward, according to the Result of very accurate Observations made of that in the Year 1723, by Dr. Halley, Dr. Bradley, and Mr. Graham. Therefore making the Calculation with this Correction of the Place of the Node, the Times of the several Circumstances of the Transit will be as follows: * Philosophical Transactions, No 386. The [237] h ~ ~ The first exterior Contact. 8 29 21 Oct. 25. in The first interior Contact. 8 31 05 the MornThe nearest Approach of the 10 46 6 ing. Centres..... The last interior Contact. 1 01 7 Afternoon. The last exterior Contact. 1 02 51 This Transit may be very aptly compared with that which happened on the 24th Day of October 1697 *; as happening at the End of a remarkable Period in Mercury's Motion, by which he is nearly in the same Situation, with respect to the Sun, at every Completion of it. Dr. Halley in his Series of Moments, in which Mercury is joined to the Sun, etc. (published in the Philosophical Transactions, No 193.) makes the Middle of this Transit at 11~ past Six in the Morning the 24th Day, or the 23d Day at 18h 11~ p. m. and the Distance of the Centres of the Sun and Mercury 10~ 04~. It may not be amiss to examine and compare these Numbers by such Observations as were made of this Transit, and may be depended on, and thereby to collect the Difference between Computation and Observation; and whatever Error arises in Excess or Defect by a proper Application to the Transit of 1743. it is imagined, will foretel it with a greater Degree of Exactness, than a Calculus from any Theory whatsoever. There was only the Egress of Mercury in the Transit of 1697. capable of being observed in Europe ~; * Mean Period 46 Years 1d 5h 43~ 42~. ~ Flamstead's Hist. Caelest. Lib. II. Fol. 32. which [238] which was done at Nuremberg in Germany, by Mr. Wurtzelbaur, and at Paris by Monsieur Cassini: At Greenwich Clouds prevented it. At Nuremberg Mr. Wurtzelbaur observed Mercury to go off of the Disk of the Sun * at 8h 45 1/2 mane about 73 1/2 Degrees from the Vertex of the Sun to the Right Hand; and Monsieur Cassini observed the same accurately at 8h 10~ 24~ mane; therefore from the known Difference of Meridians of these Places, the Egress must have happened at Greenwich at 8h 1~ mane. The Observation of Mr. Wurtzelbaur will greatly avail at coming at the Duration of the Transit. It is mentioned, that Mercury left the Limb of the Sun 73~ 30~ from his Vertex to the Right. Now at that time at Nuremberg, the Angle of the Ecliptic with the Vertical passing through the Sun's Centre, was 42~ 3~ 5~; therefore the last Point of Contact on the Sun's Limb was observed 31~ 26~ 55~ from the Ecliptic to the South, and consequently his Latitude was 8~ 28~ South at that time. To find the Point on the Sun's Limb of the Ingress, in order to come at the Duration of the Transit, we must be beholden to Computation, and the Theory of Mercury's Motion: I have therefore, from the Tables from which the above Times of the Transit of 1743 are drawn, carefully computed his Motion along his Path crossing the Disk of the Sun, and find that he moved along it after the Rate of 5~ 53~ 1/4 in an Hour, and the Difference of Latitude in 5 Hours 4~ 21~, and his Elongation 29~ 7~: Therefore the Angle of his * Vertex to the Right, it says, a Nadir Solis ad dextras; but it is a manifest Mistake, as any one upon Trial may find. visible [239] visible Way was 8~ 29~ 50~, which, doubled, and added to 31~ 26~ 55~, gives 48~ 26~ 35~, his Distance, on the Limb of the Sun from the Ecliptic also to the Southward at his Ingress on it; therefore the nearest Approach of his Centre to that of the Sun was 10~ 19~, and the Length of the Path run during the Transit 25~ 14~, and consequently the time of running it 4h 17~, the half of which 2h 8~ 1/2, subtracted from 20h 1~, the End of the Transit at Greenwich, gives the Middle there at 17h 52~ 30~, earlier by 18~ 1/2 than the Series of Moments, ~c. give it. Now as the said Series makes the Middle of the Transit of 1743, at 11h 2~ mane, and as it corresponds with that of 1697; and the Computation of that is 18~ 1/2 too late by the Series of Moments, ~c. it may be reasonably expected, that the same Computation for this of 1743 will be so much too late too; and if so, the Middle may be put down at 43~ 1/2 past 10, or 44~ at farthest, October 25th in the Forenoon. By Computation from the Tables above-mentioned, with the Correction of the Node, I make the Distance of the Centres at the nearest Approach in 1697, to be 10~ 33~, but by the Observations of Mr. Wurtzelbaur it turns out only 10~ 19~, less by 14~. Should therefore their Distance in 1743 computed in the same manner at 9~ 10~ be as much diminished, the Duration of the Transit will be protracted no less than 5~ 24~, and the first Contact will be 2~ 42~ earlier, and the last so much later, than the Times abovementioned for them. N. B. In the Computation of the Transit of 1743, the Semidiameter of the Sun is supposed 16~ 14~ 1/2, and that of Mercury 4~ 1/2; but in that of 1697, have taken [240] taken Mercury's only 3~ 1/2, imagining the precise Moments of the first and last exterior Contacts are not observable; but that the Ingress is seen some little time later, and the Egress sooner, than the true times thereof. I have all along spoke of the Motion of Mercury, without mentioning that of the Sun, whereas, in Reality, it is that of them both jointly; but as we may suppose the Sun to stand still during the Transit, it will then be considered as the apparent Motion of Mercury alone for that Time.
