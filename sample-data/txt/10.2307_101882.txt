[281] Part of a Letter from Mr. William Cole of Bristol to the Publisher, about the Grains resembling Wheat which fell lately in Wilt-shire. This City and Country round about, is filled with Reports of Raining Wheat about Warminster, and other Places within Six or Eight Miles of it, and many believe it; I have procured several Parcels of it, and carefully examined them, and find it to be the seeds of Ivy-Berries, which from Towers and Churches, Chimneys, Walls and high Buildings, were lately by very fierce Tempests of Wind and Hail, driven away from the holes, chinks and other parts where Birds had brought them, especially Sterlings and Choughs: It were to little purpose to tell you the Prodigious Stories which have been made of it; among many others, it was confidently affirmed (and backt by several, who affirme they had seen it) that those Grains were found in the Hail, as Seeds in Comfits: I do here acquaint you with it (upon Notice I had of some who have sent several Parcels of it to your Society, with strange Relations of it) to the end you may inform them of the Truth; For I have by all the ways I can Imagine examined and compared them with the Seeds of Ivy Berries, by the tast, smell, size, and Figure; with the assistance of Magnifying Glasses, viewing them in both the superficial and inward Parts. This perhaps they may have discovered before this comes to their Hands, if they desire farther Satisfaction concerning it, I shall be ready to serve them, &c. William Cole.
