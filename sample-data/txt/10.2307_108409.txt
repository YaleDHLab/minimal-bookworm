[ 483 ] XX. Additional Observations on the Djffusion of Liquids. (Third Memoir.) By THOMAS GRAHAM, Esq., F.R.S., F.C.S. &yc. Received March 27,-Read May 22, 1851. THE experiments on diffusion to be presently described are in continuation of those detailed in my last publication on the subject, the same method of observing being followed without change. The diffusion is generally made from solutions in four different proportions, so as to exhibit pretty fully the characters of the property in question for each salt, so far as is possible at a constant temperature. The salts operated upon are of two bases only, potash and soda; but the acids are considerably varied, so as to include hydrates, carbonates, sulphates, sulphites, hyposulphites, sulphovinates, oxalates, acetates and tartrates. Salts of almost every class of acids come thus to be represented, either in the present or former series of experiments on diffusion, while at the same time much information is elicited respecting the diffusive relation of the two important bases named. Comparison of Salts of Potash and Soda. Hydrate of Potash.-Time of diffusion 4-041 days. The usual number of eight cells of the 1 and 2 per cent. solutions of this substance were diffused, and four cells of the 4 and 8 per cent. solutions. The whole diffusates of each proportion were then mixed together, and the quantity of hydrate of potash diffused for two cells determined by an alkalimnetric experiment, which was always repeated twice. 1. One per cent. of hydrate of potash, density 100978, diffused at 63? 4, gave 6-56 grs. of hydrate of potash for two cells. 2. 2,005 per cent. of hydrate of potash, density 1*01878, diffused at 63?,4 gave 12,88 grs. for two cells; calculated for 2 per cent., ]2'84 grs. of hydrate of potash in two cells. 3. 4,01 per cent. of hydrate of potash, density 1-0366, diffused at 63N4, gave 12,56 grs. for one cell; calculated for 4 per cent., 12,52 grs. of hydrate of potash in one cell. 4. 8*02 per cent. of hydrate of potash, density 1-07069, diffused at 63.4, gave 26,20 grs. for one cell; calculated for 8 per cent., 26,12 grs. of hydrate of potash in one cell. 484 PROFESSOR GRAHAM ON THE DIFFUSION OF LIQUIDS.

The usual number of eight cells of the I and 2 per cent. solutions were diffused, and four cells of the 4 and 8 per cent. solutions. The whole diffusates of each proportion were then mixed together, and the quantity of hydrate of soda diffused for two cells determined by alkalirnetric experiments. 1. 1043 per cent. of hydrate of soda, density 1 01256, diffused at 630.3, gave 6-06 grs. for two cells; calculated for I per cent., 5-81 grs. of hydrate of soda in two cells. 2. 2'087 per cent. of hydrate of soda, density 10242, diffused at 630.3, gave 11-58 grs. for two cells; calculated for 2 per cent., 11 '09 grs. of hydrate of soda in two cells. 3. 4-177 per cent. of hydrate of soda, density 1-04666, diffused at 630., gave 10'90 grs. for one cell; calculated for 4 per cent., 10-43 grs. of hydrate of soda in one cell. 4. 8-35 per cent. of hydrate of soda, density 1P08846, diffused at 630.3, gave 21-10 grs. for one cell; calculated for 8 per cent., 20,22 grs. of hydrate of soda in one cell.

PROFESSOR GRIAHAM ON THE DIFFUSION OF LIQUIDS. 485 Carbonate of Potash.-Time of diffusion 8-083 days, or double the time of hydrate of potash. The usual number of eight cells of the 1 and 2 per cent. solutions were diffused, with four cells of the 4 and 8 per cent. solutions, and the diffusates of each proportion determined by alkalimetric experiments as with the preceding alkaline hydrates. 1. 1 002 per cent. of carbonate of potash, density 1'00957, diffused at 630.7, gave 6 15 grs. for two cells ; calculated for I per cent., 6-13 grs. of carbonate of potash in two cells. 2. 2*005 per cent. of carbonate of potash, density 1P01843, diffused at 6307, gave 1 95 grs. for two cells; calculated for 2 per cent., 1 1-92 grs. of carbonate of potash in two cells. 3. 4'01 per cent. of carbonate of potash, density 1 03577, diffused at 6307, gave 1 148 grs. for one cell; calculated for 4 per cent., 11.44 grs. of carbonate of potash in one cell. 4. 8#02 per cent. of carbonate of potash, density 1P06935, diffused at 6307, gave 22*79 grs. for one cell; calculated for 8 per cent., 22'72 grs. of carbonate of potash in one cell. 5. 2 005 per cent. of carbonate of potash, density 1P01843, diffused at 680.2, gave 12'64 grs. for two cells; calculated for 2 per cent., 12*62 grso of carbonate of potash in two cells.

Carbonate of Soda.-Time of diffusion 9'8994 days. The usual number of eight cells of the I and 2 per cent. solutions of this substance were diffused, and four cells of the 4 and 8 per cent. solutions, and the diffusates determined by alkalimetric experiinents. MDccc:LI. 3 u 486 PROFESSOR GRAHAM ON THE DIFFUSION OF LIQUIDS. 1. 1*003 per cent. of carbonate of soda, density 1P01120, diffused at 63? 4, gave 6*04 grs. for two cells; calculated for I per cent., 6'02 grs. of carbonate of soda in two cells. 2. 2-007 per cent. of carbonate of soda, density 1*0216, diffused at 634, gave 1 1*74 grs. for two cells; calculated for 2 per cent., 170 grs. of carbonate of soda in two cells. 3. 4-015 per cent. of carbonate of soda, density 1-04156, diffused at 63O'4, gave 10*74 grs. for one cell; calculated for 4 per cent., 10171 grs. of carbonate of soda in one cell. 4. 8*03 per cent. of carbonate of soda, density 1,0800, diffused at 630.4, gave 19'93 grs. for one cell ; calculated for 8 per cent., 19 87 grs. of carbonate of soda in one cell. In the two following additional experiments the diffusate was treated with hydrochloric acid, and estimated from the weight of chloride of sodium produced. 5. 2'007 per cent. of carbonate of soda, density 1 02166, diffused at 680 1, gave 12,06 grs. for two cells; calculated for 2 per cent., 12'02 grs. of carbonate of soda in two cells at 680.1. 6. 2*13 per cent. of carbonate of soda, density 1P02246, diffused at 590.6 in eight cells, 11212, 1P34, 11*17, 11 58; mean 11-38 grs. for two cells; calculated for 2 per cent., 10'65 grs. of carbonate of soda in two cells at 590.6.

Sulphate of Potash.-Time of diffusion 8083 days. The solution of diffused salt was evaporated to dryness and weighed. I. 1*005 per cent. of sulphate of potash, density 1'00844, diffused at 60 3, in eight cells, 611, 621, 6*12, 6'32; mean 6*19 grs. in two cells; calculated for I per cent., 6f 16 grs. of sulphate of potash in two cells. 2. 2*01 per cent. of sulphate of potash, density 1-01653, diffused at 60O'3, in eight cells, 1161, 11I58_ 11S50, 1197; mean 1166Pgrs. in two cells; calculated for 2 per cent.,e 160 grs. of sulphate of potash in two cells. 3. 4,02 per cent. of sulphate of potash, density 1'03240, diffused at 60O'3, in four cells, lO-S0, 1 P33, 11-20, 12'07 ; mean I P35 grs. for one cell; calculated for 4 per cent. 1 135 grs. of sulphate of potash in one cell. 4. 8'04 per cent. of sulphate of potash, density 1 06306, diffused at 600 3 in four cells, 21'91, 21'93, 22'00, 22'47; mean 22#08 grs. for one cell; calculated for 8 per cent., 221'96 grs. of sulphate of potash in one cell, Diffusion of Sulphate of Potash in 8'083 days at 60'-3; two cells.

The numblers for the sulphate of potash and hydrate of potash (p. 412) would probably correspond 3a2e 488 PROFESSOR GRAHAM ON THE DIFFUSION OF LIQUIDS. closely at the same temperature, the times of diffusion of the two substances being taken as 2 to 1. Sulphate of Soda.-Time of diffusion 9 9 days. The diffusate was evaporated to dryness and weighed. 1. One per cent. of sulphate of soda, density 100940, diffused at 590.9, in eight cells, 6,31 6 47, 6-21, 6-32; mean 6'33 grs. for two cells. 2. 1*995 per cent. of sulphate of soda, density 1*01832, diffused at 590.9, in eight cells, 12*02, 12'10, 11'66, 12'16; mean 11,98 grs. for two cells; calculated for 2 per cent., 12 00 grs. of sulphate of soda in two cells at 590.9, 3. 3.99 per cent. of sulphate of soda, density 1'03594, diffused at 590.9, in four cells, 10,00, 10'80, 11-53, 11P53 ; mean 1096 grs. for one cell; calculated for 4 per cent., 10'98 grs. of sulphate of soda in one cell at 590.9. 4. 7'98 per cent. of sulphate of soda, density 106960, diffused at 590.9, in four cells, 20,50 21'36, 20-01, 20-68; mean 20'64 grs. for one cell; calculated for 8 per cent., 20,69 grs. of sulphate of soda in one cell at 590.9.

The assumed relation in the times of equal diffusion for salts of potash and soda appears to derive support from' the sulphates, particularly in the lower proportions of salt. Comparative Diffusion of Sulphate of Potash in 8-083 days at 600.3, and Sulphate of Soda in 9-9 davs at 590?9. From solutions of 1 per cent. 2 per cent. 4 per cent. 8 per cent.

The preceding times of diffusion were observed. 5. 2'013 per cent. of sulphate of potash, diffused at 590.8, in eight cells, gave 1 1'90, 1 1'94, 1 1 *41, 1 171; mean 1 1'74 grs. for two cells ; calculated for 2 per cent., ] 1 *67 grs. of sulphate of potash in two cells. 6. Two per cent. of sulphate of soda, density A0l846, diffused at 590.6, in eight cells, gave 1 1*58, I 1 56, I 1 94, 1 1 ~97; wean 1 1-76 gus. of sulphate of soda in two cells. PROFESSOR GRAHAM ON THE DIFFUSION OF LIQUIDS. 489 The present results, from 2 per cent. solutions of these salts, are as follows Sulphate of potash in 8,083 days at 590.8 . . . 1 167 100 Sulphate of soda in 9 9 days at 590.6 . . . . 1176 10094 The diffusion in the selected times appears therefore to be, as nearly as possible, equal at the present temperatures. Another experiment may be recorded at present, of which the object was to ascertain the influence of free sulphuric acid upon the diffusion of sulphate of soda. 7. Sulphate of soda, 2 02 per cent., to which an equivalent quantity of sulphuric acid was added, had the density 1,02703. This solution, diffused into pure water, in eight cells, at 590.6, for the same time as the preceding sulphate of soda, gave a diffusate of 9170, 10*06, 10#17 and 10 29 grs. of sulphate of soda; mean 10-05 grs. in two cells; calculated for 2 per cent., this diffusate becomes 9 95 grs. The presence of one equivalent of sulphuric acid appears therefore to diminish the diffusion of sulphate of soda considerably, namely, from 1 176 to 9 95 grs., or from 100 to 84,61. The free sulphuric acid diffused in the experiment was not determined. Suiphite of Potash.-It was curious to observe how far this and other salts of the oxygen acids of sulphur correspond with the sulphates. Time of diffusion 8083 days. The diffusate was treated with sulphuric acid and estimated in the form of neutral sulphate of potash. 1P90 per cent. of sulphite of potash, density 1'01753, diffused at 590.5, in eight cells, gave 11P36, 10'72, 11 22 and 10-90 grs. in two cells; mean 1105 grs. in two cells; calculated for 2 per cent., 1 1,63 grs. Making the comparison for 2 per cent. solutions we haveSulphate of potash at 600 3 . . . 1 1-60 100 Sulphite of potash at 590?5 . . . 1 163 100 26 The two salts appear to have the same diffusibility. Sulphite of Soda.-Time of diffusion 9.9 days. The diffusate was estimated in the same manner as the preceding salt. 2*26 per cent. of sulphite of soda, density 1,02330, diffused at 59.6, in eight cells, gave 12,93, 13-35, 13,56 and 13-62 grs. in two cells; mean 13,37 grs. in two cells; calculated for 2 per cent., 1 183 grs. The comparative diffusion of the sulphites of the two bases is as follows:Sulphite of potash in 8,083 days at 590?5. 1 163 100 Sulphite of soda in 9 9 days at 590.6 . 11 83 100'72 The sulphites of potash and soda appear therefore to exhibit the usual relation of these two bases. Hyposulphite of Potash.-Time of diffusion 8-083 days. The diffusate was evaporated to dryness with sulphuric acid, ignited and estimated from the sulphate produced. 490 PROFESSOR GRAHAM ON THE DIFFUSION OF LIQUIDS. 1925 per cent. of anhydrous hyposulphite of potash, density 1*0150, diffused at 590.8, in eight cells, gave 1 1'66, 1 IP67, 12,01 1*26 grs.; mean 1 IP90 grs. for two cells; calculated for 2 per cent., 12*37 grs. of hyposulphite of potash in two cells. Comparing this salt with the sulphate of the same base, we haveSulphate of potash at 600-3 . . . 1 160 100 Hyposulphite of potash at 5908. 12'37 106,44 A slight error in excess may possibly have been introduced from the circumstance that the hyposulphite of potash employed was not absolutely free from sulphate. Hyposulphite of Soda.-ATime of diffusion 9.9 days. The diffusate was estimated in the same manner as the preceding salt. 2#136 per cent. of anhydrous hyposulphite of soda, density 1'01778, diffused at .590.9, in eight cells, gave 13,11, 12*77, 12*92, 11'99 grs.; mean 12`0 grs. for two cells; calculated for 2 per cent., 1 89 grs. of hyposulphite of soda in two cells. The comparative diffusion of the salts of potash and soda appears thus: Hyposulphite of potash in 8-083 days at 590.8 . 12-37 100 Hyposulphite of soda in 9#9 days at 590.9. 1 1*89 96*21 The relation of the sulphate and hyposulphite of soda appears still closer. Sulphate of soda at 5906 . . . 1176 100 Hyposulphite of soda at 590.9 . . 1 1'89 101 10 Sulphovinate of Potash.-Tinme of diffusion 8#083 days. The diffusate was evaporated to dryness and ignited with sulphuric acid. 1-966 per cent. of sulphovinate of potash, of density 1-00977, diffused at 590.8, in eight cells, gave 12-57, 12'48, 12*12 and 12 39 grs.; mean 12-39 grs. for two cells; calculated for 2 per cent., 12-60 grs. of sulphovinate of potash in two cells. The diffusion of this salt appears in excess when compared with sulphate of potash. Sulphate of potash at 600.3 . . . 11'60 100 Sulphovrinate of potash at 590.8 . . 12#60 108-62 Suiphovinate of Soda.-Time of diffusion 9,9 days. The diffusate was estimated in the same manner as the preceding salt. 2'063 per cent. of sulphovinate of soda, of density 1 00944, diffused at 590.6, in eight cells, gave 13*32, 13-50, 13-78 and 13-15 grs.; mean 13*44 grs. for two cells; calculated for 2 per cent., 13'03 grs. of sulphovinate of soda in two cells. Comparing the two sulphovinates together, we haveSulphovinate of potash in 8-083 days at 590 8 . . . 12 60 100 Sulphovinate of soda in 99 days at 59? 6 . 13,03 103,41 Neither of these sulphovinates appeared to suffer decomposition in the act of diffusion, at least to any considerable extent. But the experiments on both of these salts are less precise than usual, from the difficulty of obtaining them entirely free from sullphates. PROFESSOR GRAHAM ON THE DIFFUSION OF LIQUIDS. 491 Oxalate of Potash.-Time of diffusion 8'083 days. The diffusate was evaporated to dryness, ignited, and then converted into chloride of potassium. 1. 0 981 per cent. of anhydrous oxalate of potash, density 1P00775, diffused at 590-, in eight cells, 6'24, 6'22, 5'91, 5'97; mean 6'08 grs. for two cells; calculated for 1 pet cent., 6'20 grs. of oxalate of potash in two cells. 2. 1 92 per cent. of oxalate of potash, density 1P01463, diffused at 590.9, in eight cells, 1 1P54, 11x63, 1 1-94, 11'63; mean 1 1-68 grs. for two cells; calculated for 2 pet cent., 12'17 grs. of oxalate of potash, in two cells. 3. 3^84 per cent. of oxalate of potash, density 1-02864, diffused at 590.9, in four cells, 1110, 1 1'16, 11'09, 10'92; mean 1 1'07 grs. for one cell; calculated for 4 per cent., 11P52 grs. of oxalate of potash in one cell. 4. 7'68 per cent. of oxalate of potash, density 1'05604, diffused at 590.9, in four cells, 20'45 20'63, 20'995 20-15 mean 20,55 grs. for one cell; calculated for 8 pet cent., 2141 grs. of oxalate of potash in one cell.

Sulphate of potash .100.. 100 100 100 100 Oxalate of potash ............ 100-65 104'91 101'50 97'47 The sensible excess in the diffusion of the 2 pet cent. solution of oxalate of potash is, I believe, to be accountedfor by this proportion having been estimated in the form of carbonate of potash instead of chloride of potassium. Oxalate of Soda.-Time of diffusion 9e9 days. The diffusate was evaporated to dryness, ignited and then converted into chloride, as with the preceding oxalate of potash. 1. 0925 per cent. of oxalate of soda, density 1 00882, diffused at 590.9, in eight cells, 5.99, 5 81, 5569, 5.59; mean 5-77 grs. for 2 cells; calculated for 1 per cent., 6'24 grs. of oxalate of soda in two cells. It was found impossible to form a 2 per cent. solution of this salt from its sparing solubility, so that the observations respecting it are limited to the lowest proportion of salt. 492 PROFESSOR GRAHAM ON THE DIFFUSION OF LIQUIDS.

But a parallelism still holds between the acetate and sulphate, and the diffusion of the two salts would probably coincide if that of the acetate were observed at a temperature 30 or 40 lower than the sulphate.

(p. 486). The double 7artrate of Potash and Soda afforded an interesting instance of decornposition produced by diffusion. Instead of the usual diffusion cells, a single plain cylindrical jar was employed about 5 inches in diameter and 10 inches in height. A portion of a 4 per cent. solution of Rochelle salt, amounting to 5000 grs. of liquid, was covered over by nine times as much pure water, in this jar, and the salt allowed to diffuse upwards for three weeks at 560. The upper third of the fluid column, amounting to 17,000 grs. of liquid, was then drawn off, evaporated to dryness, and the salt ignited and converted, by the addition of hydrochloric acid, into chloride, which weighed 3-14 grs. The salt proved to be a mixture of the two chlorides in the proportion of 2-43 grs. of chloride of potassium and 0171 gr. of chloride of sodium. This gives the following as the composition of the diffusate: Tartrate of potash. . 368 Tartrate of soda . 1 . . . 117 4*85 It hence follows that the proportion of potash, or of tartrate of potash, in the diffusate is nearly three times greater than existed in the original Rochelle salt. It will be recollected that the salt decomposed is, strictly speaking, a bibasic tartrate of potash and soda, and not a double tartrate of potash and soda. The diffusate was observed to be exactly neutral to test-paper. This mode of diffusing upwards in water from the lower part of a deep jar obviously gives the greatest degree of separation attainable in consequence of unequal diffusibility. I may confine myself at present to the conclusion that of the nine pairs of potash and soda salts, of which the diffusion is compared in this paper, the potash salt uniformly exceeds in diffusibility the corresponding soda salt; that the ratio between the two classes is always sensibly the same, or exhibits only a small range of variation at the temperature of the experiments, which was near 600; with the peculiar exception of the hydrates of potash and soda,
