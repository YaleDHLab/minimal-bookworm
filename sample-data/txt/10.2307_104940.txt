An Account of a remarkable Echinus: By Gustavus Brander, Esq; F. R. S. T H I S echinus is of a very singular species. It appears to me to be of a middling nature between the echinus and the star-fish. It comes from the island of Bourbon in the East-Indies; and I cannot learn, that it is any where described.
