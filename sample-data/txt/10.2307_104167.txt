T A K E of Litharge parts iij. of Sand or calcined Flint p. i. pound and mix these very well together, then run them into a yellow Glass with a strong Fire. Pound this Glass, and grind it into a subtile Powder, which moisten with a well saturated Solution of Silver, make it into a Paste, which put into a Crucible, and cover it with a Cover. Give at first a gentle Degree of Fire, then increase it, and continue it till you have a Glass, which will be green. Pound this Glass again, and grind it to a fine Powder; moisten this Powder with some Beer, so that by means of an Hair Pencil you may apply it upon the Vessels, [or any Piece of Earthen-ware]. The Vessels that are painted or cover'd over with this Glazing, must be first well heated, then put under a Mussle, and as soon as the Glass runs, you must * smoak them, and take out the Vessels. * Afflare debes fumum.
