E 623 3 XXVII. On the Meteorology of the Lake District of Cumberland and Westmoreland, including the Results of Experiments on the Fall of Rain at various heights, up to 3166 feet above the sea-level.-Fourth paper, for the year 1850. By JOHN FLETCHER MILLER, F.R.S., F.R.A.S., Assoc. Inst. C.E. 8&c. Received February 21,-Read March 13, 1851. Introductory Remarks. IN the month of December last I visited the Lake District, chiefly with the view of ascertaining approximately, the heights above the sea of some of the mountain gauges which I have hitherto been obliged to estimate. The heights of these stations were taken by means of an excellent aneroid barometer (previously compared with a standard), and a standard barometer read simultaneously, or nearly so, at the sealevel. By this method I found the height of Cockermouth above the sea to be 127 feet, Keswick 253 feet (Crosthwaite 258 feet), Bassenthwaite Lake and Lowdore (measured from Keswick) 214 and 224 feet respectively; Seathwaite (mean of two observations calculated from Lowdore) 368 feet; from Wastdale IHead, 399 feet; and taken direct from the sea-level, 389 feet. I find the summit of Seatollar Common to be about 1590 feet, and the gauge 1388 feet above the sea, assuming the elevation of Seathwaite to be 368 feet; the gauge on Sprinkling Fell or the Stye, 948 feet, measured from Wastdale, and 936 feet by a simultaneous barometrical reading at the coast. Two distinct observations taken on the 16th and 17th of December, show the gauge near the top of Stye Head Pass to be 1443 and 1448 feet above the sea respectively, supposing the height of Wastdale Head village to be 247 feet. Mr. OTLEY states the summit of the Pass to be 1250 feet above the valley, or, taking Wastdale Head at 247 feet, 1497 feet above the sea, and an observation of Dr. DALTON'S from the same base, gives 1506 feet, both of which correspond very nearly with my own results, as the gauge is somewhat below the highest part of the road leading over the Pass. I have hitherto stated the height of this station to be 1250 feet, but it appears I have misinterpreted my authority (Mr. OTLEY), whose calculation represents the height above the valley, not above the sea. rrhe gauges on Brant Rigg and on Liugmell appear to be 924 and 1778 feet respectively above the sea. At the latter station, the barometer fell to 27 00 in., while in the valley it stood at 28 67 in., and at Whitehaven at 28 86 in. Temperature in the valley 480; at 1778 feet, 3208, wet bulb 320 2, heavy rain falling. I was prevented from ascending to any of the higher stations by the unfavourable state of the weather; indeed the barometrical observation at Brant Rigg, and also a second reading on Stye Head were taken at night, after 4L2 624 MR. J. F. MILLER ON THE METEOROLOGY OF THE LAKE having been confined to the valley the whole of the day by torrents of rain; I have consequently not had an opportunity of ascertaining the altitude of Sprinkling Tarn, but in 1812 Dr. DALTON states it to be 1860 feet; and another observation either by DALTON or OTLEY, gives 1943 feet above the sea. I have therefore allowed the elevation of 1900 feet, previously given in my tables, to remain unaltered for the present. A complete and authentic table of the heights of our principal lakes and mountains is much wanted. Of the elevations given in the Guide Books to the Lake District, some are probably not far from the truth, but others are undoubtedly very erroneous; thus, Ennerdale Lake, by the Whitehaven Waterworks' Survey, proves to be 356 feet above the sea, instead of 246 feet, as stated in one of these treatises, showing an error or miscalculation of 110 feet. This is, no doubt, an extreme instance; but the altitudes of several of our lakes and mountains are yet unknown; and a careful measurement or remeasurement of the whole of them with accurate instruments and under favourable circumstances is very desirable, as the results would be more or less interesting and valuable both to the meteorologist and the geologist, the botanist and the tourist.

The mercurial thermometer got deranged in August, and a duplicate sent to supply its place was also found to be separated in the column on its arrival at Seathwaite, and consequently useless. Considerable delay took place before the instrumnents were adjusted, and the registrar did not receive them again till the middle of December. From about the middleof August till the 17th of December, the maxilmulrU1 was obtained by frequent examination of the spirit thermnometer in the course of the day; the mean of the mnaximum for 1850 is in consequence about 10.5 too low. The mercurial thermometer, prior to its getting out of orders was considered to be nearly free fromt index error, and the night thertmometer has been compared with it throughout the scale, and reduced to the miercurial as a standard.

At Seathwaite, the thermometer on grass is a common spirit thermometer on a boxwood scale. Naked thermometers were used for a year or two, but the observations were so frequently interrupted by breakage, that it was deemed preferable to employ a less fragile instrument. DISTRICT OF CUMBERLAND AND WESTMORELAND., 629 Remarks. The fall of rain throughout the Lake District in 1850, is slightly above the average of the six preceding years. At Seathwaite, the depth is 1P77 inch over the average of this period. The largest daily falls in 1850, at the three principal stations, are grouped as under:Wastdale. Langdale.

At Whitehaven, on the west coast, seventeen miles distant in a direct line, bearing W.N.W. from Seathwaite, the mean of the maximum for the same period is 54?`18; mean of minimlum, 440.25; average mean temperature, 490?22. The mean difference between the two places is, in the maximum, 10.86; in the rminimum, 10.82, and in the mean 10.84, the temperature at Whitehaven being higher than at Seathwaite by these quantities. The mean temperature at Whitehaven fromt eighteen years' observations is 490; at Greenwich, the mean for seventy-eight years is 480 3; and at Somerset House for sixty-nine years, 490.5. The radiation of heat from the earth's surface at night, as indicated by self-registering thertnometers fully exposed to the sky on grass, appears on the whole to be greater in the mountain valleys than at the coast, and particularly in summer; but, occasionally in the winter months, the results are strangely and unaccountably anomalous. Thus, in November 1850, the mean amount or effect indicatedwas only 00.90, and in December the mean reading of the thermometer on the grass was identical with that at 4 feet above the surface. At Whitehaven, the amount in those months was 50.25 and 50.86. Yet the same instrument (which has been in use at Seathwaite since 1846) in nearly all the other months of 1850, shows a greater extent of radiation than at Whitehaven. Results almost equally abnormal were presented in the winter of 1846 and 1847, and as such they were omitted from the Tables for that year*. I have examined the'thermometer employed at Seathwaite for indicating the direct effect of terrestrial radiation; the column is perfect, and I am satisfied it has no material index error, and that it is correctly read off; moreover, it is exposed in the same place throughout the year. The cause of its occasional anomalous indications in the winter months must therefore be left unexplained for the present.* Philosophical Transactions, Part I. 1849, p. 85.MDCCCLI. 630 MR. J. F. MILLER ON THE METEOROLOGY OF THE LAKE The Mountatin Gauges.-The phenomena exhibited by the mountain gauges in the year 1850, do not seem to call for any particular comment, as the results are very generally in accordance with the deductions embodied in former papers which have appeared in the Transactions of the Royal Society; and at the present filme I am, more anxious to eliminate new facts and to accumulate a mass of accurate observations and well-digested results made and obtained both in normal and abnormal seasons and under various modifying circumstances, than to theorize upon or draw from them inferences or conclusions which extended experience may modify, contradict or destroy. The following Table shows the excess or deficiency per cent. of the principal mountain gauges over or under the quantity of rain received by the adjacent valley of Wastdale, both in the summer and winter months, in each year since the instruments were erected in 1846. The positive sign signifies that the quantity is greater, and the negative sign that it is less than the fall in the valley in the same period. Summer Months.

DISTRICT OF CUMBERLAND AND WESTMORELAND. 631 of the Lake District. The increase in the per-centage in the winter months of 1850 is doubtless attributable to the fact of the deposition being almost entirely in the form of rain, the fall of snow on the mountains having been unusually small both in the early and latter months of the past year. The most interesting and important circumstance connected with the experiments in 1850, is the discovery of a mountain station which promises to yield nearly oniethird more rain than the celebrated hamlet of Seathwaite in Borrowdale, hitherto, and with good reason, considered to be the wettest spot in Great Britain. The new station is about a mile and a half distant from Seathwaite in a south-westerly direction, and 580 feet above it, or 948 feet above the sea-level, at the extreme southern termination of the valley; it is on the shoulder of Sprinkling Fell or the Stye, about 100 yards south of the road leading over the Stye Pass to Wastdale. The actual quantity of water measured on Sprinkling Fell in eleven months of 1850, is 174-33 inches; but the receiver was found running over on four different occasions, by which I calculate 5 or 6 inches at least must have been lost to the instrument; hence, if we add 5-67 inches for overflow, and 9'49 inches for the computed depth in January (7 34 inches at Seathwaite), the result is 189*49 inches for the fall on the Stye in 1850, with 143^96 inches at Seathwaite*. The wettest year since the commencement of the experiments is 1848, when 160*89 inches fell at Seathwaite; and, computing the fall at the new station for that year in the same proportion which the two localities bear to each other in 1850, we have 211 #62 inches for the depth of rain on the Stye in 1848. An inspection of the following Table, which exhibits the fall at the coast during the last eighteen years, will show that the period (1844-50) over which the Lake District gauges have been in operation, has been far from a wet one.

J. F. MILLER ON THE METEOROLOGY OF THE LAKE At Whitehaven, the average annual fall from 1844 to 1850 inclusive, is 43 543 inches; but in the eleven years preceding 1844, the average is 4853 inches; and the average of the last eighteen years, from 1833 to 1850 inclusive, is 46-58 inches. And if we analyse the period of seven years comprehended between 1844 and -1850, we find that only three of those years have exceeded the average; while of the remaining four, one year is characterized by drought, and the other three by unusual dryness. Even in the year 1848, when 161 inches fell at Seathwaite, the depth at Whitehaven was only 47,34 inches, or -fths of an inch above the average of eighteen years; whilst in 1835 , th e fall was 5 4 13 inches; itI 1836, 5 8'97 inc hes; and in 1841, 5597 inches. It is not pretended that the gradation in quantity between Seathwaite and Whitehaven in any particular year will tbe the same in other single years, or that the differential iilean of one term of vears will correspond precisely with that of other terms of equal length, although I conceive that the proportion found to obtain for a group of ten consecutive years, will never be very widely departed from in future decennial periods; but we may, at least, fairly assume that a wet or a dry season at either station will bear a similar character at the other; and sufficient evidence has been adduced to show that the mean annual fall of rain in the Lake District has yet. to be determined, by the incorporation of a future tern of wet years with the comparatively dry period already on record. And this remark applies with still greater force to the maximum fall, as, judging from the records kept at the coast during eighteen years, no one of the last seven, during which the Lake District gauges have been in action, has any pretension to a character for excessive wetness. Hence, the maximum annual depth in the mountainr district of Cumberland may far exceed the computed fall of 211 inches at the Stye in 1848, enormous and almost incredible as is the quantity for a climate situated in the heart of the temperate zone. I may observe that the fall of rain at the coast in one year is rigidly comparable with any other year; the gauge having been in the same spot, or at least within a few feet of it, from the year 1832 up to the present time. Moreover, the same gauge and the same glass metre (graduated to the yo-1th part of an inch) have been used from the first; and the rain has been read off daily throughout the period. In my paper printed in the Philosophical Transactions for 1848 (Part I[.), allusion was made to the difference in the receipts of rain gauges within 100 yards of each other, when placed near the head of a valley. A still more remarkable instance is presented in the past year, but in this case the gauge is considerably elevated above the valley. On the 31st of Aug-rust 1849, the gauge on Seatollar Commnion, 1338 feet above the sea, was removed 90 yards to the south-westward, nearly in a direct line, the difference in height between the old and new station being only 5 feet.
