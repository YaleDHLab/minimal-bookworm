IV. A Letter from Mr. John Dove to Edmund Halley, LL. D. F. R. S. and Reg. Astrom. at Greenwich, containing an Account of a Comet seen on February 29, 1731/2. From on Board the Monmouth, James Montgomery Commander, in Table-Bay, March 17, 1731/2. S I R, I Had the Honour to wait on the Governor the 8th of February, in Latitude 33~ South, where he parted with us for St. Hellena. The 29th of February, at about half an Hour past Ten at Night, I judge (having a good Observation at Noon) we were in Lat. 34~ 28~ South, and Long. 12~ 35 West from Cape Bonne Esperance, the Moon shining very bright, being near the Full, we saw something very bright rise about West, which I judge to be a Comet: It set about East, passing from West to East in about five Minutes, between the Moon and our Zenith, and to the Southward of Spica Virginis; it carried a Stream of Light after it about 40~ (394) 40~ long, and 10 or 10 1/2 broad; the Brightness of the Moon outshined the Comet as it came near it. Please to excuse the Trouble of this by the Way of Holland; but knowing your Curiosity in Astronomy, and viewing your Synopsis of the Astronomy of Comets, I thought it might be in some measure acceptable, though we had not Conveniency to take a very exact Observation of it. I am, S I R, Your most humble Servant, J O H N D O V E. P. S. Variation per Azimuth, a. M. about four or five Leagues West from this Bay, by two Compasses, 16~ 23~ West; and by eight Observations in this Bay, Azimuths and Amplitudes, the Medium 15~ 56~ West.
