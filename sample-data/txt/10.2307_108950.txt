[ 309 ] XV. Researches on Acids of the Lactic Series.-No. I. Synthesis of Acids of the Lactic Series. By E. FRANKLAND, F.R.S., Professor of Chemistry in the Royal Institution of Great Britain and in the Government School of Mines; and B. F. DUPPA, Esjr. Received February 14,-Read March 1, 1866. WITH the exception of the acetic series, no family of organic acids has excited so much interest amongst chemists, and been the subject of such numerous researches, as that represented by lactic acid. Its character, intermediate between the monobasic and dibasic acids, its close relations to the acetic and acrylic families, and the numerous important transformations which it undergoes, have all contributed to render this family an attractive subject for experimental inquiry and a fruitful source of theoretical speculation. These inquiries and hypotheses have contributed greatly to the elucidation of the habits of these acids, and still more to the general progress of organic chemistry. Nevertheless there are two circumstances which have materially interfered with their complete success; these are, the comparatively small number of the known members of this series, and the absence of any synthetical proof of the nature of their constituent radicals. These obstacles to a more satisfactory conception of the internal architecture of the acids in question we have endeavoured to remove by the production, according to purely synthetical methods, of a number of new members of this series, a brief notice of which we have from time to time had the honour of submitting to the Royal Society*, and the more complete history of which we propose to develope in the following pages. Our general method for synthetically producing the acids of the lactic series depends upon the replacement of one of the atoms of dyad oxygen in oxalic acid, or rather in the ethereal salts of oxalic acid, by two atoms of monad alcohol radicals. Such a replacement at once transforms dibasic oxalic acid into a monobasic acid of the lactic series. The nature of this transformation. as well as the relations of oxalic acid to the lactic family, is clearly seen from the following comparison of the formulae of oxalic acid and of its derivative, dimethoxalic acid: 'O Q W(C H3)2 0 H COllo f CMe2Ho C2' . 0? or {C I__ :_t C2 _ or lo C o t0 C0Ho Oxalic acid.

In this reaction ethylic oxalate * was mixed with rather more than its own volume of -pure zincethyl; the temperature of the mixture gradually rose, and large volumes of gas were evolved. This gas, which, as the following analyses prove, consists of about equal volumes of ethylic hydride and ethylene, was passed through a U-tube immersed in ice, and subsequently through sulphuric acid, and was then collected over mercury. It was found to be soluble in an equal volume of strong alcohol, and gave the following numbers on analysis: 1. Ilillimetres of mercury. Temperature. Pressure of gas used .2372 14-0 C.

After trying the numerous methods which have been recommended, we found the following process to give the largest product:1500 grammes of oxalic acid, thoroughly dried at 100? C., are placed, together with 1000 grammes of absolute methylated spirit, in a capacious retort, which is then very slowly heated by an oil-bath to 1000 C., at which temperature water begins to distil over; when the thermometer has risen to 1050, a steady stream of absolute methylated spirit is conducted to the bottom of the retort at the rate of about 80 grammes per hour, the temperature being allowed to rise very slowly to 1250?130? C., care being taken on the one hand that alcohol shall not distil over, in which case the temperature should be raised, and on the other that the heat is not so great as to cause the generation of gas. At this rate it requires about twelve hours to make the addition of 1000 grammes of alcohol; after which the retort must be gradually heated to the boiling-point of ethylic oxalate, and the remainder of the distillate, which is the pure oxalic ether, collected apart. By fractional distillation the first portions afford a considerable additional quantity of the pure product besides ethylic formate. During the final operation, in consequence of the presence of some unconverted oxalic acid, a quantity of gas is always evolved; nevertheless, in frequently repeated operations, we have obtained an amount of pure ethylic oxalate equal in weight to the dried oxalic acid employed.

DUPPA'S It is therefore evident that this gas results from the decomposition of ethyl according to the following equation, {C2H5 C2115} + C2H Ethyl. Ethylic hydride. Ethylene. and that for the attainment of the desired result of the reaction it is best to prevent this secondary decomposition as much as possible. This we succeeded in doing by preventing the temperature from rising beyond 60? C. or 70 C., until the operation was considerably advanced. Afterwards it was necessary to heat to 1000 C. to complete the reaction. The mixture generally continues fluid, but assumes a light straw-colour and a thick oily consistency. On being heated to 130? C. in a retort, no distillate passes over. If, after cooling, its own volume of water be very gradually added, torrents of ethylic hydride are evolved, and, on subsequent distillation in a water-bath, weak alcohol containing an ethereal oil in solution passes over; and a further quantity of the oil may be obtained by adding water to the residue in the retort, and continuing the distillation on a sand-bath. By repeated rectification the alcohol can be approximately separated from the water and oil, whilst the latter may then be removed by a separator. The oily product so obtained was submitted to rectification, when its boiling-point rapidly rose to 1 750, at which temperature the whole of the remaining and very large proportion of the liquid distilled over. The composition of this liquid is determined by the following analyses:I. '2872 grm. gave *6261 grm. carbonic anhydride and *2710 grm. water.

IV. *3223 grm. gave -7070 grm. carbonic anhydride and *2917 grm. water.

The first of these equations expresses the action of zincethyl upon ethylic oxalate, by which ethylic zincmonethyl diethoxalate is formed*. The second shows the action of water upon this compound, by which the zincmonethyl (Zn C2 H5) becomes replaced by hydrogens. Although we have not been able to isolate the body ethylic zincmonethyl diethoxalate from the other product of this decomposition, yet we have proved its existence by forming it synthetically, as described below. Ethylic diethoxalate is a colourless, transparent, and somewhat oily liquid, possessing a peculiar and penetrating ethereal odour, and a sharp taste. It is insoluble in water, but readily soluble in alcohol or ether. Its specific gravity is *9613 at 18'-7 C.; it boils at 1750C. and distils unchanged.

Chimique, 1864, p. 116); and we have since confirmed it by the synthetical production of ethylic zincmonethyl diethoxalate, as described below. t The final result of this reaction is exactly homologous with the production of glycollic acid by the action of nascent hydrogen upon oxalic acid, described by SCIHULZE (Ann. de Chim. et de Phys. t. lxvii. p. 366), {aoxO + X4 = { 2 + H120. Oxalic acid. Glycollic acid, 314 MESSRS. E. FRANKLAND AND B. F. DUPPA'S When zincethyl is added to ethylic diethoxalate previously cooled in a freezing-mix ture, each drop of the zinc compound, as it comes into contact with the ether, hisses like phosphoric anhydride when dropped into water. Torrents of ethylic hydride are evolved, and the mixture finally solidifies to a white tenacious mass which fuses on the application' of heat, and does not distil below 1000 C., at about which temperature a violent action sets in; a great quantity of gas is evolved, and the residue solidifies to a pitchlike mass, which on treatment with water and subsequent distillation yields about one-fourth of the ethylic diethoxalate employed. If the above-mentioned white mass, instead of being heated, be mixed with water, it effervesces strongly, zinc hydrate is formed, and pure ethylic diethoxalate separates in quantity nearly equal to that originally employed. In a quantitative experiment 12-93 grms. of zincethyl were treated with ethylic diethoxalate, excess being avoided; 15X67 grms. of ethylic diethoxalate were required to saturate the above quantity of zincethyl, and the weight of ethylic hydride evolved, which was carefully determined, amounted to 3 08 grms. These numbers closely agree with those deduced from the following equation:{C Elt2 Ho + Zn" Et2 ~C Et2 (0 Zn` Et) +Et H, C OEto 2 COEto Ethylic Ethylic zirnemonethyl diethoxalate. diethoxalate. as seen from the annexed comparison: Theoretical.

Ethylic zincmonethyl diethoxalate combines energetically with iodine, an ethereal solution of the latter added to it is almost instantaneously decolorized, and a large quantity of ethylic iodide is produced. In continuation of the above quantitative experiment the following results were obtained. Theproduct of the action of 12-93 grms. of zincethyl upon 15 67 grms. of ethylic diethoxalate decolorized an ethereal solution containing 23'75 grmns. of iodine, the quantity required by the following equation being 25'04 grms.

It was obviously impossible to collect in a state of purity the ethylic iodide thus set at liberty without considerable loss; but the quantity of the pure iodide actually obtained was 12 grms. The above equation requires 14 6 grms. On the removal of ether and ethylic iodide, the mixture of ethylic zincodiethoxalate and zincic iodide forms a transparent gummy mass easily soluble in ether, carbonic disulphide, or caoutchoucin, but totally incapable of crystallizing from any of its solutions. All our attempts to separate these bodies have hitherto proved abortive; and it is by no means improbable that they are chemically combined. The existence of monad organo-zinc radicals, such as zincmonethyl, receives further support from the slow action of oxygen upon zincethyl, which clearly shows that there are two distinct stages in the process of oxidation. These stages have indeed already been indicated by one of us in describing the reactions of this body*. When a current of dry oxygen is made to pass through an ethereal solution of zincethyl, dense white fumes continue to fill the atmosphere of the vessel, until about one-half of the total quantity of oxygen necessary for the complete oxidation of the zincethyl has been taken up. Then the white fumes entirely cease, showing the absence of free zincethyl, and at the same moment the liquid, which up to that time had remained perfectly transparent, begins to deposit a copious white precipitate, and the latter continues to increase until the remaining half of the oxygen is absorbed. If the process of oxidation be arrested when the white fumes cease to be formed, the product effervesces violently when mixed with water, owing to the escape of ethylic hydride; but when the oxidation is completed, the white solid mass produced consists chiefly of zincethylate, and does not in the slightest degree effervesce in contact with water. The two stages of this reaction depend essentially upon the successive linking of the zinc with the two atoms of ethyl by means of dyad oxygen. The first stage of oxidation is expressed by the following equation, ZnI Et2 + 0 = Zn" Et Eto. Zineethyl. Zincethylo-ethylate.

IUPPA'S atom of that element; and it is this further absorption that constitutes the second stage above referred to, resulting in the production of zincic ethylate, Zn" Et Eto + 0 = Zn" Eto2. WANKLYN * was the first clearly to point out the probable existence of zincmonethyl, or rather its homologue zincmonomethyl, indicating at the same time its radical function, when he ascribed to the crystalline compound obtained in the preparation of zincmethyl the formula ZnMeC In the same memoir he also represented this compound as the analogue of mercuric methiodide, Hg"j Me I BUTLEROW+ has also prominently drawn attention to this behaviour of organic zinc compounds, and has succeeded in obtaining zincmethylo-methylate, Zn" Me Meo in a condition approaching to purity by passing a stream of dry air through a solution of zincmethyl in methylic iodide. BUTLEROW'S success in obtaining this body, and his failure in converting it into zincmethylate, are both probably due to the comparative insolubility of zincmethylo-methylate in methylic iodide, owing to which the first product of oxidation was to a great extent protected from the further action of oxygen. When, however, ether is used as the solvent in the case of zincethyl, the oxidized product remains in solution till the first stage is passed, after which zincethylate is gradually precipitated until the second stage is completed. Indeed, as has been shown in the memoir above referred to (Philosophical Transactions, 1855, p. 268), the oxidation, instead of stopping at the first stage, proceeds even somewhat further than the second, and the final product formed does not possess a composition in any degree approaching that which BBUTLERow asserts it to have. This is evident from the following numbers, and from the circumstance that it does not effervesce in the slightest degree when mixed with water: Percentage composition according Percentage composition according C2H to mean of analysesH to BuTrnow's formula, Zn' to0 mea of anlss 2 1 C . .34.53 25-43 H . . . 7-20 5*32 Zn 46-76 4204 O . .11-51 27 21 10000 100-00 When ethylic diethoxalate is treated with solution of baric hydrate, it gradually* Journ.

DUPPA'S Diethoxalic acid is very soluble in alcohol or ether, and somewhat less so in water. By the spontaneous evaporation of its aqueous solution, it crystallizes in minute prismatic needles; but if a small quantity of dilute sulphuric acid be added to the solution, the crystals are deposited in magnificent anorthic prisms, which frequently attain a length of 1 inch and a thickness of 1 inch. IDiethoxalic acid is greasy to the touch, like stearic acid; it fuses at 740.5 C., and slowly sublimes at the same temperature, but is decomposed before reaching its boiling-point. It has a sour taste, reddens litmus strongly, and expels carbonic acid from bases. It forms an extensive series of salts, which are all soluble in water. In addition to the barium-salt described above, we have examined the silver, copper, and zinc salts. Argentic diethoxalate is readily prepared by boiling an aqueous solution of the acid with excess of argentic carbonate. On filtration and evaporation in vacuo, the salt crystallizes in brilliant needles, radiating from centres standing up freely from the capsule, and containing half a molecule of water, which is not expelled at 1000 C.

Two determinations of the solubility of this salt in water at 160 C. gave the following results: I. One part of the salt dissolved in 291 parts of water. II. One part of the salt dissolved in 312 parts of water. Its solubility in boiling water is not much greater. Although so difficultly soluble in pure water, it dissolves very readily in a solution of zincic iodide. The method of producing ethylic diethoxalate above described involves the previous preparation of considerable quantities of zincethyl; but we have found that the process may be much simplified by generating the zincethyl during the reaction, which is effected by gently heating a mixture of granulated zinc, ethylic iodide, and ethylic oxalate for several hours. After long experience in the production of this and other homologous compounds described below, we have found the following process for the preparation of ethylic diethoxalate to give a maximum product. 600 grammes of a mixture consisting of one molecule of ethylic oxalate and two of ethylic iodide, were placed in a capacious flask with such a quantity of well-dried granulated zinc that the latter rose above the surface of the liquid. An inverted Liebig's condenser was attached to the flask. It is preferable to use zinc which has been employed in a previous operation, as it not only acts with greater rapidity, but also at a much lower temperature. The flask was immersed in water maintained at a temperature of about 30? C. After a period of time which varies in each operation, but which is usually from twelve to twenty-four hours, an energetic action sets in, which must be checked by lowering the temperature of the water-bath. The reaction once commenced is usually completed in from twelve to eighteen hours, the temperature of the waterbath being maintained at about 300 C. until it is nearly concluded, when it may be raised to 1000 C. The operation may be regarded as complete when the hot liquid assumes the consistency of honey, and solidifies to a more or less crystalline mass on cooling, although a considerable quantity of the mixed ethers is still unacted upon. Water being now gradually added until it equals three times the volume of the crystalline mass, with which it must be well mixed by agitation, a copious effervescence takes place; zincic oxalate and oxide are formed in abundance, whilst, on the application of the heat of an oil-bath, alcohol, accompanied by ethylic diethoxalate, distils over together with the ethylic iodide that has not been acted upon. This distillate is then treated in exactly the same manner as that already described for the separation and purification of 2 X2 320 MESSRS. E. FRANKLAND AND B. F. DUPPA'S ethylic diethoxalate prepared by means of zincethyl. In the operation above mentioned with 600 grammes of the mixed ethylic iodide and oxalate, 86 grammes of pure ethylic diethoxalate were obtained, the theoretical amount being 105 grammes. II. Action of Zinc upon a Mixture of kMethylic Iodide and Metkylic Oxalate. Two atoms of methylic iodide were mixed with one of methylic oxalate, and placed in contact with an excess of granulated zinc at 30? C. in a flask as above described. At the conclusion of the reaction the liquid solidified to a crystalline mass, which, on distillation with water, yielded methylic alcohol possessing an ethereal odour, but from which no ether could be extracted. The residual magma in the flask, consisting of zincic iodide, zincic oxalate, and the zinc salt of a new acid, was separated from the metallic zinc by washing with water. It was then treated with an excess of baric hydrate, and boiled for a considerable time; carbonic anhydride was afterwards passed through the liquid until, on again boiling, the excess of baryta was completely removed. To the filtered solution recently precipitated argentic oxide was added until all iodine was removed. The solution separated from the argentic iodide was again submitted -to a current of carbonic anhydride, boiled, and filtered. The resulting liquid, on being evaporated on the water-bath, yielded a salt crystallizing in brilliant needles, possessing the peculiar odour of fresh butter. This salt is very soluble in water and in alcohol, but nearly insoluble in ether, and perfectly neutral to test-papers.

It boils at about 2120 C., and distils unchanged. Dimethoxalic acid reacts strongly acid, and unites with bases, forming a numerous class of salts, several of which are crystalline. In addition to the barium-salt above mentioned we have examined the silver-salt, which is best formed by adding argentic oxide to the free acid, heating to, boiling, and filtering, when the salt is deposited in starlike masses of nacreous scales as the solution cools.

Judging, however, from our subsequent success in obtaining ethylic dimethoxalate as described below, we believe that the methylic ether would probably be obtained by repeatedly agitating with ether the aqueous distillate obtained from the crude product of the original operation, methylic dimethoxalate being evidently like ethylic dimethoxalate, miscible with water in all proportions. Assuming the formation of this ether, its production from the mutual action of zinc, methylic oxalate, and methylic iodide, followed by that of water, would be expressed in the following equations:fCOMeo + Z11+4Me1= C Me2(OZn" Me) +Zn"MeMeo+2Zn"12 ICO0Meo lCO0Meo Methylic Methylic zinemonomethyl Zinemethylooxalate. dimethoxalate. methylate. {CO~eo + 2H2 O= iCMe + He} + Zn" Ho2.

This reaction was performed in exactly the same manner as the last. On the addition of water, the product yielded, on subsequent distillation, a considerable quantity of an ethereal body, which distilled over together with the ethylic iodide that had not been acted upon. The addition of water to the distillate effected an approximate separation of the ethereal from the alcoholic portion; the former was then decanted and distilled for the purpose of separating alcohol and ethylic iodide. When the temperature of ebullition rose to 100? C., the liquid left in the retort was placed over calcic chloride for twelve hours, after which it was again submitted to distillation, when its boiling-point almost immediately rose to 165? C.

The silver-salt of the latter crystallizes, as above described (page 318), in brilliant needles radiating from centres standing freely up from the capsule, and containing half a molecule of water, which is not expelled at 1000 C. This salt also further differs from that just described by being rapidly discoloured when exposed to the heat of a steam-bath. In a future communication we hope to be able to throw additional light upon this apparent isomerism. IV. Action of Zinc upon a Mixture of Ethylic Iodide, Methylic Iodide, and Ethylic Oxalate. Having proved in the foregoing reactions the possibility of replacing one atom of oxygen in ethylic oxalate bytwo atoms of either methyl or ethyl, we thought it desirable SYNTHETICAL RESEARCHES ON ACIDS OF THE LACTIC SERIES. 327 to ascertain whether the same replacement could be effected by an atom of each of two different monad alcohol-radicals. We endeavoured to accomplish this by acting with zinc upon a mixture consisting of one atom of ethylic oxalate and one atom each of the methylic and ethylic iodides, by which we hoped to obtain an acid of the following composition, CEtMeHo COt~Ho C5 H10 3O HoO Experiment completely proved the practicability of this reaction; and its result even exceeded our expectations, since not only was the ether corresponding to the above acid formed with the greatest facility, but it was produced almost to the complete exclusion of the ethers of diethoxalic and dimethoxalic acids. 200 grammes of ethylic oxalate were mixed with the proper atomic proportions of methylic iodide and ethylic iodide, and were digested with granulated zinc for several days at a temperature of from 350 to 400 C., until the supernatant liquid became oily, and solidified to a crystalline mass on cooling. Water being now added till effervescence ceased, the whole was submitted to distillation in an oil-bath. With the exception of a small quantity of the mixed ethylic and methylic iodides that had escaped decomposition, the distillate consisted of a homogeneous liquid composed of water, ethylic and methylic alcohols, and an ethereal body, which last was separated by repeated agitation with large volumes of ether and subsequent rectification. In this manner there was obtained a large quantity of a liquid which boiled constantly at 165?-5 C., and yielded on analysis numbers very closely corresponding with the formula Car H,4 ={ CEtMeHo 7 1 3 CO0Eto I. *2843 grm. gave 5990 grm. carbonic anhydride and *2498 grm. water.

A not inconsiderable amount of the ether thus formed in this and in the analogous reactions described above, appears to be decomposed by the zincic hydrate; at all events an appreciable quantity of the zinc-salt of the derived acid is always obtained from the residue left after distillation of the ethereal product. Ethylic ethomethoxcdate, as we propose to name the new ether, is a colourless, transparent and mobile liquid, possessing a penetrating 'ethereal odour much -resembling that of ethylic diethoxalate. It is very soluble in water, alcohol, and ether, and' has a specific' gravity of '9768 at 13'C. It boils at 1650-5 C.; and a determination' of its vapourdensity gave the following results.

Ethylic ethomethoxalate is readily decomposed even by aqueous solutions of the alkalies and of baryta, yielding alcohol and a salt of the base. By this means baric ethomethoxalate was prepared.

When a mixture of equivalent proportions of ethylic oxalate and amylic iodide is digested with granulated zinc at 700?C., the zinc is gradually dissolved, while much 330 MESSRS. E. FRANKLAND AND B. F. DUPPA'S amylic hydride and amylene are given off. The mixture finally assumes a viscous or semisolid condition, and when treated with water produces a further quantity of amylic hydride, which distils off at a gentle heat. On the subsequent application of a higher temperature, water accompanied by amylic alcohol, amylic iodide, and an ethereal liquid distil over, the three latter forming a mixture the separation of which into its component parts presents rather formidable difficulties. After drying with calcic chloride, the oily mixture begins to boil at about 1320 C.; the product first passing over consists principally of amylic alcohol mixed with amylic iodide. Afterwards the thermometer rapidly rises to 200' C., between which temperature and 205' C. a considerable section of the remaining liquid, which we will call A, passes over. There then occurs a further rapid rise of temperature until the thermometer remains stationary between 2220 and 226?C. The section collected between these points we will call B. Finally, the temperature rises to 2600 to 264?, between which points the remaining liquid (C) passes over. By repeated fractional distillation, the larger portion of the section A was obtained at the nearly fixed boiling-point of 2030 C.

We have not attempted to give a name to the body from which ethylic amylhydroxalate is directly produced by the action of water, as shown in the last of the foregoing equations. The resources of chemical nomenclature, already too severely taxed, would scarcely be able to elaborate a rational name for this body, which consists of ethylic oxalate wherein an atom of oxygen is replaced half by amyl and half by zincmonamyl, whilst a second atom of zincmonamyl is substituted for an atom of ethyl. Ethylic amylhydroxalate is a somewhat oily, transparent, and slightly straw-coloured liquid of specific gravity 9449 at 13? C., possessing a pleasant aromatic odour and burning taste.

We found, it is true, a remarkable depression of temperature, amounting to 90.3 C. on mixing one atom of ethylic oxalate with one of amylic iodide; but on submitting the mixture to distillation, the thermometer rose to the boiling-point of amylic iodide (1470) before ebullition commenced, thus showing that none of the much more volatile ethylic iodide had been formed. No transfer of radicals therefore takes place when ethylic oxalate is heated with amylic iodide; and consequently no zincethyl can be formed when this mixture is acted on by zinc.

SYNTHETICAL RESEARCHES ON ACIDS OF THE LACTIC SERIES. 3338 Ethylic ethyl-amylhydroxalate is a straw-coloured oily liquid, possessing an aromatic but somewhat amylic odour and a burning taste. Its specific gravity was found to be '9399 at 130 C. It boils between 224? and 225? C.

It is, however, a thicker oil, and flows less readily, and has the lowest specific gravity of any ether belonging to this series, its density at 130 0. being only *9137.

The investigation of these ethers has revealed a tendency to dissociation, increasing with the weight of the atoms replacing the atom of oxygen in ethylic oxalate.

The first is obtained by decomposing ethylic amylhydroxalate with baryta, treating the solution of the barium-salt thus obtained with excess of sulphuric acid, and then dissolving out the organic acid with ether. On evaporating the ethereal solution, the acid remains as a thick oil which does not crystallize after several days' exposure over sulphuric acid in vacuao. The calcium-salt forms a white crystalline mass soluble in water.

The formula {CAyHHo C14 H26 Ba!' 06 or C Bae CAy HHo requires 32'08 per cent. of barium. We have also obtained a beautifully crystalline acid of the same composition as the above, from its zinc-salt contained in the residue remaining after the distillation of the three ethers above described. Amylaydroxalic acid prepared from this zincsalt is but sparingly soluble in water, from which, however, it crystallizes in magnificent nacreous scales that fuse at 60.50 C., but afterwards remain liquid for some time even at ordinary temperatures; they are very unctuous to the touch, and readily soluble in alcohol and ether.

The acid is afterwards liberated by the addition of sulphuric acid in excess, and may then be dissolved out of the mixture by ether. On the evaporation of the latter, the acid remains as a thick oil gradually solidifying to a crystalline mass, which, however, did not appear to be in a fit state for the determination of its fusing-point.

SYNTHETICAL RESEARCHES ON ACIDS OF THlE LACTIC SERIES. 337 The acid of the third ether (diamyloxalic acid) is best prepared by decomposing the ether with boiling baryta-water. After removing the excess of baryta in the usual manner, baric diamyloxalate crystallizes on evaporation in minute elastic needles, which, when dry, have the appearance of wool. It is moderately soluble in hot water, but sparingly so in cold. Two determinations of barium in this salt gave the following results: I. *2139 grm. of baric diamyloxalate gave *0875 grm. baric sulphate. I. *2155 grm. gave *0771 grm. baric carbonate.

If baric diamyloxalate be dissolved in hot dilute alcohol and excess of sulphuric acid be added, the liquid after filtration contains diamyloxalic acid in solution.

This acid is remarkable for its high melting-point, 1220 C., in which respect it surpasses any of the acids of this series. Its melting-point is very sharply defined, and it solidifies immediately on a very slight reduction of temperature. Heated more strongly, it sublimes and condenses on a cold surface in white crystalline flakes like snow. 338 MESSRS. E. FRANKLAND AND B. F. DUPPA'S VI.

The reaction proceeded with extreme sluggishness, and was not completed before the expiration of a week.

Amylic diethoxalate is a colourless, transparent, and slightly oily liquid, possessing a fragrant odour of a somewhat amylic character.

They are, however, at once distinguished by the products of their decomposition with alkalies, ethylic ethyl-amylhydroxalate giving ethylic alcohol and a salt of ethyl-amylhydroxalic acid, whilst amylic diethoxalate yields amylic alcohol and a salt of diethoxalic acid. VII. Action of Zinc upon a Mixture of Amylic Iodide and Amylic Oxalate. When equivalent proportions of amylic iodide and amylic oxalate are gently heated in contact with zinc, a brisk reaction soon sets in. After evolving much amylic hydride and amylene, the whole solidifies to a gum-like mass, which, on distillation with water, yields an oily liquid resembling that obtained when ethylic oxalate is employed. We have every reason to believe that the same series of ethers as those described under No. V. are here produced, with the difference that they are amylic instead of ethylic ethers. This difference of base, however, renders the separation of these ethers from each other a very difficult operation, and we have therefore left this reaction comparatively unexplored. Two of these ethers were, however, collected; the one boiling at about 280?-290?

The second ether mentioned above boiled between 2150 and 2200 C.; it was decomposed by alcoholic potash; the potash-salt so obtained, heated with dilute sulphuric acid, yielded to ether an oily acid possessing the characteristic odour of caproic acid. This acid, boiled with argentic carbonate suspended in water, gave on filtration magnificent nacreous plates of a silver-salt which were very sparingly soluble in water, only slightly acted upon by light, in fact possessing all the properties of normal silver caproate, and differing markedly from the isomeric silver diethacetate recently described by us Submitted to analysis this salt yielded the following results: *1517 grm. gave *1776 grm. carbonic anhydride, *0685 grm. water, and *0729 grm. metallic silver. These numbers agree closely with those calculated from the formula of silver caproate, as seen from the following comparison:C6 H1l Ag 02, or fC 112 or C Ay O Ago. (C 0 Ago, Calculated. Found.

We have stated that it boiled between 2150 and 220?. The boiling-point of amylic caproate is not known; but ethylic caproate boils, according to FEHLING, at 1620 C.; consequently the boiling-point of amylic caproate ought to be, according to Kopp's law, 2160 C., a number which lies between the points observed in the ether under consideration. It is thus evident that the three variations in the action of zincamylide upon an oxalic ether, described above as giving rise to amylhydroxalic acid, ethyl-amylhydroxalic acid, and diamyloxalic acid, do not exhaust the fertility of this reaction; and the pro-* Philosophical Transactions, vol. clvi. p. 37. SYNTHETICAL RESEARCHES ON ACIDS OF THE LACTIC SERIES. 341 duction of caproic acid, as above described, shows that the action of these substances upon each other is susceptible of yet a fourth modification, in which the molecule of amylic oxalate appears to divide into its two constituent atoms of amyloxatyl (C 0 Ayo), which then unite with amyl to form amylic caproate. {COoAYo + Ay2 = 2CAyOAyo, or 2{cluH2 Amylic oxalate. Amyl. Amylic caproate. The source of the amyl in this reaction is not difficult to discover; for, as above stated, torrents of the usual products of its transformation (amylic hydride and amylene) were evolved during the operation; in fact it was obvious that no inconsiderable portions of the zinc and amylic iodide were occupied in the formation of zincic iodide and amyl, a considerable proportion of the latter being as usual transformed at the moment of separation into amylic hydride and amylene. 2Ay I+ Zn"= Zn" 12+Ay2. Meeting with this reaction, as we have done, only at the close of the above investigation, we have not been able to ascertain whether or not it is one of general occurrence. It is true that we have not observed the formation of the fatty ethers in any of the foregoing reactions in which zinc and the iodides of the radicals were employed; but the comparatively low boiling-points of these ethers might easily have led to their having been overlooked. We consider, however, this reaction of so much importance, that we shall at once endeavour to ascertain whether or not it occurs in the other homologous cases, giving rise to acetic ether in the case of methylic iodide, and to propionic ether where ethylic iodide is employed. We have already stated that the constitution of the acids of the lactic series has been the subject of fruitful controversy amongst chemists. In this discussion widely different opinions have been advanced: some have assigned to lactic acid the formula (C6 H12 06), and attributed to it a dibasic character; some have reduced this formula to C3 H6 03, still retaining for the acid the same degree of basicity; whilst others, again, have regarded it as monobasic, and assigned to it the lower formula. This controversy respecting the constitution of an acid so intimately related to several of the most important families of organic compounds, has been the incentive to numerous and highly important researches, which have thrown valuable light not merely upon the structure of the lactic series itself, but also upon that of organic families allied with this series. Amongst the experimental investigations which have contributed to the elucidation of this subject, we beg leave to refer to those of WURTZ *, ULRICHI , STRECKER 4, BRiINING ?, PERKIN, and DUPPA ||. Again, WURTZ, PERKIN, KEKULEI, and especially KOLBE, have, by their acute theoretical speculations, most ably supplemented direct investigation.* Comptes Rendus, vol. lii. p. 1067. + Ann. der Chem. und Pharm. vol. xci. p. 352. t Ann. der Chem. und Pharm. vol. cix. p. 271. ?

DUPPA'S Unfortunately these researches and discussions were, to a great extent, limited to two members of this series, viz. lactic and glycolic acids, and this circumstance necessarily furnished a comparatively small basis upon which to build purely theoretical speculations. We are therefore not without hope that, with the addition of the numerous members of this series described in the foregoing pages, and with the light thrown upon them by their synthetical production, we have reached a new stage in the inquiry, whence a more extensive prospect may be obtained. Before proceeding to take a survey of the new field thus opened up, it is necessary first to call special attention to a negative or chlorous organic radical intimately connected with the compounds above described. The Rladical Oxatyl. An inspection of the above and following formulae for acids of the lactic series shows that, through all the changes of the lactic acid type giving rise to the various species of acids mentioned below, the group C 0 Ho remains unaltered. We have also shown that the same group maintains its individuality unimpaired throughout the acetic and acrylic series of acids; in fact it is the presence of this group which impresses upon an organic compound the acid character. We believe, therefore, that its claims to be considered a compound radical are at least equal to those of any other group of elements to which that term has been applied. We propose for this radical the name oxatyl*-a word recalling at the same time its acidifying power, and its connexion with oxalic acid, which is the isolated molecule of this radical, COHo COHo Oxalic acid. We have, in fact, experimentally proved above, that when ethylic oxalate is acted upon by nascent amyl, it is converted into ethylic caproate, CCOEto + CBu H2 2jCBuH2 C Eto LCBuH2 C O Eto Ethylic oxalate. Amyl. Ethylic caproate. Oxatyl is closely related to cyanogen, the two radicals passing into each other in a host of reactions; hence the production of cyanides from the ammonium salts of the fatty acids on the one hand, and the synthesis of acids from certain cyanogen compounds on the other-a reaction first pointed out by KOLBE and FRANKLAND j, and which has of late yielded such magnificent results in the hands of MAXWELL SIMPSON4p and of KOLBE and HuGo MfLLER?.* Oxalyl would obviously be the most appropriate name for this radical, had it not already been applied to the two compounds C 0 and C 0?. Whilst this paper is passing through the press we find that the radical oxatyl has already been fully recognized by BUTLEROW. t Memoirs of Chem. Soc. vol. iii.

The researches of these chemists prove that the introduction of cyanogen into an organic compound, and its subsequent transformation into oxatyl, converts that compound into an acid, or, if already an acid, increases its basicity by unity for each atom of oxatyl so developed, this result being apparently quite independent of the position of the oxatyl in the molecule. The atom of oxatyl, as the above molecular formula shows, may be regarded as methyl (C 13) in which two atoms of hydrogen have been replaced by one of oxygen, and the third by hydroxyl (Ho). The individualizing of this group confers upon the formulak of most of the great families of organic compounds a simplicity hitherto unattainable without ignoring their atomic constitution. The passage from one organic family to another thus becomes a mere substitution of the hydroxyl contained in oxatyl by other radicals, either simple or compound. When, for instance, it is replaced by the peroxide of a metal, the acid of which the oxatyl is a constituent becomes converted into a salt: thus Sodic acetate .C3 lCONao {CH3 Baric acetate .1ao".

All compound radicals are purely conventional groupings of elements, intended to simplify the expression of chemical change; and in this respect we believe the group oxatyl, entering as it does into the constitution of nearly every organic acid, has as valid a claim to a distinct name as the most universally recognized radicals. Its admission renders possible the following very simple expression of the law governing the basicity of nearly all organic acids: SYNTHETICAL RESEARCHES ON ACIDS OF THE LACTIC SERIES. 345 An organic acid containing n atoms of oxatyl is n-basic. Classification of the Acids of the Lactic Series. We propose classifying all acids of the lactic series at present known, or which could be obtained by obvious processes, into the following eight divisions:1. Normal Acids. 5. Normal Olefine Acids. 2. Etheric Normal Acids. 6. Etheric Normal Olefine Acids. 3. Secondary Acids. 7. Secondary Olefine Acids. 4. Etheric Secondary Acids. 8. Etheric Secondary Olefine Acids. 1st. Normal Acids.-A normal acid of the lactic series may be defined as one in which an atom of carbon is united with oxatyl, hydroxyl, and at least one atom of hydrogen. The general formula of these acids is therefore CRHHo COHo In this formula R may be either hydrogen or any monad alcohol radical; and the number of acids possessing the same atomic weight, and belonging to this division, is determined by the number of isomeric modifications of which the alcohol radical is susceptible. Thus, of the acids containing two, three, or four atoms of carbon, there can be only one of each belonging to this division, because these acids cannot contain an alcohol radical higher in the series than ethyl, which is not susceptible of isomeric modification; but a normal acid containing propyl can have one isomer in this division, the two acids containing respectively propyl (C Et 12) and isopropyl (C Me2 E).

Etheric Secondary Acids.-These acids stand in the same relation to the secondary as the etheric normal to the normal acids; they consequently contain a monad organic radical in the place of the hydrogen of the non-oxatylic hydroxyl.

The number of isomers in this division will obviously depend, first, upon the complementary variations of R and (C H2)n; secondly, upon the isomeric modifications of which R is susceptible; and thirdly, upon the isomeric modifications of (C H2)fl 6th.

Etheric Secondary Olefine Acids.-These acids are related to the secondary olefine acids in the same way as the sixth division to the fifth. No member of the seventh or eighth division has yet been formed. Isomerism in the Lactic Series. The members of the lactic series may be defined as acids containing one atom of oxatyl, the fourth bond of the carbon of which is united with the carbon of a basylous group containing one atom, and one only, of hydroxyl, or of the peroxide of a radical, either alcoholic or acid. The following examples, expressed in the graphic notation of CRUx BRowN*, will serve to illustrate this definition, Acids of the Lactic Series. @-@~~~~~~~~ He Lactic acid. Methyl-lactic acid. Aceto-lactic acid. The synthetical study of the acids of this series affords an insight into numerous and interesting cases of isomerism, which have hitherto received, at best, but a very imperfect explanation. Commencing with the lowest member of the series, we have for glycollic acid . 0.* Edinburgh Phil. Trans. for 1864, p, 707. It is much to be desired that chemists should employ these graphic formula in all cases where they wish to express the mode in which they suppose the elements of a chemical compound to be combined. It is often extremely difficult to trace in symbolic formulae, the exact meaning which the author attaches to the grouping of letters; in graphic formulae no such difficulty can arise;MDCCCLXVI. 3B 350 MESSRS. E. FRANKLAND AND B. F. DUPPA'S An inspection of this formula shows that glycollic acid admits of no isomeric modification, except with a total change of type, unless a different value be assigned to the individual bonds of an atom of carbon. The part of the formula below the dotted line represents oxatyl, which, as we have already shown, cannot be altered without sacrificing the acid character of the compound; there remains therefore only the part of the formula above the dotted line, which admits of the following modification:The acid represented by the formula so modified no longer comes within our definition of the lactic series. It is carbomethylic acid, and differs essentially from glycollic acid and the lactic series in general, inasmuch as the carbon of its chlorous radical, oxatyl, is linked to the carbon of the basylous radical by oxygen*. There being no decisive evidence that homolactic acid differs from glycollic acid, experiment and theory both agree in asserting that the formula C2 H4 03 represents only one acid in the lactic series. Proceeding now one step higher in this series, we have in the formula of lactic acid an expression capable of the following three variations without quitting the lactic typeand we therefore think that the use of these formule, where constitutional expressions are intended, will greatly tend to clearness and precision. It is scarcely necessary to repeat CRaut BtRowN's remark, that such formulaX are not meant to indicate the physical, but merelythe chemical position of the atoms. For the purpose of rendering the graphic more easy of comparison with symbolic fornulke, we have sometimes dissected the former into their constituent radicals by dotted lines, as above. This dissection, whilst assisting the eye in reading the formula, cannot fail to suggest the, for the most part, purely conventional character of such radicals. * Bearing this constitution of carbomethylic acid in mind, we have only to go one step further in order to perceive the constitution of carbonic acid itself, and the anomalous basicity of that acid; for if, in the above graphic formula, for carbomethylic acid we replace the methyl by hydrogen, we have Carbomethylic acid. Carbonic acid. It is thus evident that our radical oxatyl, when united with hydroxyl, has sufficient chlorous power to produce a feebly dibasic acid, but inasmuch as carbonic acid is not included in the category of organic acids, it forms no exception to the law above enunciated.

COxu BRowN has already pointed out this relation between lactic and paralactic acids, as well as the formula of ethylene given below.-Edinburgh Phil. Trans. for 1864, p. 712.3B2 352 MESSRS. .

By the action of nascent hydrogen, both isomeric chlorides will obviously produce the same propionic acid. The cause of the isomerism of methyl-glycollic acid (No. 3, page 351) is so obvious as to require no further explanation.

The third of the above formulae is obviously that of HEINTZ'S ethyl-glycollic acid*. The origin of WURTZ's butylactic acid, which was prepared by an analytical process, does not permit of any safe conclusion being drawn as to its constitution. Of the possible acids containing five atoms of carbon, only one (the ethomethoxalic acid described above) is knownt.

WAAGE* states that zincic leucate requires 300 parts of water at 16? for its solution, whilst we find that zincic diethoxalate requires 302 parts at 16 (C. Doubtless the study of the products of the transformation of these acids will reveal the difference existing between them: we are at present preparing leucic acid for this purpose. We have also mentioned in the experimental part of this paper that diethoxalic acid prepared from methylic diethoxalate yields a silver-salt which differs from that obtained with the acid from ethylic diethoxalate; and we have even noticed indications of a third synthesized isomer; but we reserve the further inquiry into the nature of these acids for a future communication. On the Proximate Analysis of the Acids of the Lactic Series. The investigations recorded in the foregoing pages show that the division of acids of the lactic series which we have termed secondary acids, is derived from oxalic acid by the substitution of two atoms of monad alcohol radicals for one atom of oxygen in that acid. This substitution destroys one of the atoms of oxatyl in oxalic acid, thus reducing the latter from a dibasic to a monobasic acid. This theory of the structure of the secondary acids, so unmistakeably indicated by the mode of their formation, we have also extended to the normal acids, which are thus regarded as derived from oxalic acid, by the replacement of one atom of oxygen in the latter, either by hydrogen alone, as in glycollic acid, or by one atom of hydrogen and one of a monad alcohol radical: COHo CH Ho ICMeHHo COHo C OHo iCOHo Oxalic acid. Glycollic acid. Lactic acid. Hitherto we have advanced only synthetical evidence of this constitution; but the question presents itself, if the radicals indicated by our hypothesis really exist in these acids, can they not be again disentangled from the complex molecule, either in the condition in which they entered it, or, at all events, in the form of well recognized derivatives Such analytical evidence, although possessing far less weight than synthetical, may still be of service as corroborative testimony. We will therefore show how such a proximate analysis of these acids may be accomplished, and for this purpose will first endeavour to demonstrate that if in a chain of carbon atoms any two be united by two bonds of each, the remaining atoms being united to each other by one bond only, the chain is more liable to rupture at the point of double junction than at any other. We have shown how in dimethoxalic acid a weak link of this kind can be developedf; for if dimethoxalic ether be treated with phosphorous chloride, it is transformed into ethylic methacrylate, the acid of which contains two atoms of carbon in the condition just indicated. The nature of this transformation and the link in the chain which is thus weakened are shown in the following graphic formulae:-* Ann. der Ch. und Pharm. Bd. cxviii. S. 295. t Journ. Chem.

SYNTHETICAL RESEARCHES ON ACIDS OF THE LACTIC SERIES. 359 We beg to append the following summary of conclusions to which our investigations have conducted us: 1. All acids of the lactic series are essentially monobasic. 2. These acids are of four species-, viz. normal, secondary, normal olefine, and secondary olefine acids; and each of these species has its own etheric series of acids, in which the hydrogen of the hydroxyl contained in the positive or basylous constituent of the acid is replaced by a compound organic radical, either positive or negative. 3. The normal acids are derived from oxalic acid by the replacement of one atom of oxygen, either by two atoms of hydrogen, or by one atom of hydrogen and one atom of an alcohol radical. 4. The secondary acids are derived from oxalic acid by the replacement of one atom of oxygen by two atoms of monad alcohol radicals. 5. The olefine acids are derived from oxalic acid by a like substitution of two monad positive radicals for one atom of oxygen, with the insertion of an olefine or dyad radical (Cn Hl2) between the two atoms of oxatyl. 6. The acids of the lactic series stand to the acids of the acetic series in the very simple relation first pointed out by KOLBE, viZ. that by the replacement, by hydrogen of the hydroxyl, ethoxyl, &c., contained in the positive radical of an acid of the lactic series, that acid becomes converted into a member of the acetic series. 7. The acids of the lactic series stand in an almost equally simple relation to those of the acrylic series as is seen on comparing the following formulah: C(C H13)H Ho fC(C H12)" H COHo WCOHo Lactic acid. Acrylic acid.
