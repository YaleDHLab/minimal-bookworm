S. concerning the use which may be made of the following History of the Weather, made by him at Oxford through out the year 1684. Sir. IT would be needless to acquaint you with the Universal approbation, your new and easy invention of observing the rise and fall of the Mercury in the Barometer(by parallel lines drawn from every decimal part of each month of its whole extent,) was received in our Philosophical Society at Oxford: since I here send you the Observ. of a full year made by their order,not only of the rise, and fall of the Quicksilver,(~markt by the wandring prickt line in the figure belonging to each month,) and the weather; but also how the wind stood each day throughout the whole year, except the Month of Jan. which was not thought of at first; though (if we respect the use of such Observations,) as material a part as any whatever: for when once we have procured fit persons enough to make the same Observations in many forreign and remote parts, how the winds stood in each, at the same time, we shall then be enabled with some grounds to examin, not only the coastings, breadth,and bounds of the winds themselves, but of the weather they bring with them; and probably in time thereby learn, to be forewarned certainly, of divers emergencies (such as heats, colds, dearths,plague,and other epidemical distempers,) which are now unaccountable to us; and by their causes be instructed for prevention, or remedies: thence too in time we may hope to be inform'd how far the positions of the planets in relation to one another,and to the fixt starrs, are concerned in the alterations of the weather,and in bringing and preventing diseases,or other calamities; [931] lamities; for by this means it is doubtless, that the Learned Dr. Goad of London, has arrived to that pitch of knowledg, he already has, in predicting weather, &c. i. e. by making such old Almanacks as this for many years, in stead of new ones; which if once faithfully done in divers parts of the world (as it is now happily begun,) we shall certainly obtain more reall and usefull knowledg in these matters in a few years, then we have yet arrived to, in many Centuries: which no question was the opinion of the industrious Walter Merle Fellow of Merton Coll. who thus observed the weather here at Oxford every day of the month, seven years together viz. from Jan. 1337 to Jan. 1344; the MS. Copy of which Observations are yet remaining in the Bodleyan Library; and doubtless 'twas some such consideration as this, that moved Erasmus Bartholin to make Observations of the weather every day of the month through the whole year 1671 which are printed inter Acta Medica Tho Bartholini. Now Sir if these worthy Gent. thought it worth their while, laboriously to make such Observations without the helps that you have afforded us; how supine had we been, if we had forborn to prosecute it; I am sure I could not have thought my self otherwise, had I neglected it, after I had received the commands of so judicious a Society; and the rather because then too, I should have rudely slighted an Invention of yours, who have always afforded me the inesti mable Character of Your most faithfull Freind Rob. Plot. P 3 A heme [932] Observations of the Wind, Weather, and height of the Mercury in the Barometer, throughout the year 1684;taken(after Dr. Listers method,) in the Musaeum Ashmoleanum, at the request of the Philosophicall Society of Oxford; by Robert Plot, LLD.
