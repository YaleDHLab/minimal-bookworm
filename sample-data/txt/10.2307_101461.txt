Of the richest Salt-Springs in Germany. An Account having been desired of those two chief SaltSprings in Germany, at Hall and Lunenburg, it was lately transmitted thus: The Salt-Springs at Hall in Saxony are four, called Gutiaar, the Dutch-Spring, the Mettritz, and the Hackel-dorn; whereof the three first hold near the same proportion of Salt; the last holds less, but yields the purest Salt. The three first hold about seven parts of Salt, three of Marcasit, and fourteen of Water: They are, besides their Oeconomical use, employed Medicinally to Bath in, and to draw a Spirit out of it, exhibited with good success against Venom, and the putrefaction of the Lungs, Liver, Reins, and the Spleen. The Salt Water at Lunenburgh, being more greenish then white, and not very transparent, is about the same nature and hold with that of Hall. It hath a mixture of Lead with it,whence also it will not be sod in Leaden Pans;and if it held no Lead at all, it would not be so good, that Mettal being judged to purrifie the Water: whence also the Salt of Lunengurgh (137) nenburg is preferred before all others, that are made of Salt.
