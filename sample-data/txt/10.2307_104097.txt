S. concerning an extraordinary large Horn of the Stag Kind, taken out of the Sea on the Coast of Lancashire. I N C L O S E D is a Sketch of an Horn, which I thought of an extraordinary Size, the Dimensions whereof are exactly set down, as I took them myself, by laying a String along the Surface. Vid. Fig. 4. Part of the left Horn of a Stag. a e the Length 30 Inches. b b the Circumference above the third Branch, 7 Inches. c the Circumference above the second Branch, 8 Inches. d d the Circumference between the Brow and second Antler, 11 Inches. e e the Circumference 10 Inches. d e the Circumference of the Brow-Antler, 63/4 Inches. e f the Length of the Antler, 163/4 Inches. This Horn was drawn out of Raven's Barrow Hole, adjoining to Holker Old Park, by the Net of a Fisherman, on the 20th of June, 1727. The Tide flows constantly where it was found, and the Land is very high near it. This Horn is now in the Possession of Sir Thomas Lowther, Bart. of Holker, in Cartmell in Lancashire. S I R, Your Humble Servant, J. H O P K I N S. L l 2 Several (258) Several Horns of this Kind, and extraordinary Size, have been frequently dug up in Bogs in Ireland, but I never met with an Account of any being found in the Sea before. I shall refer the Curious to the Account of the large Horns found under Ground in Ireland, communicated to the Royal Society by Sir Thomas Molyneux, M. D. F. R. S. which is printed in these Transactions, Numb. 227,p.489,&c. and to the Description of the Moose Deer by the Honourable Paul Dudley, Esq; F. R. S. Numb. 368, p. 165, &c. VIII.
