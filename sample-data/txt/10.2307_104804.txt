[192] IV. An Account of a Bristle that was lodged in a Gentleman's Foot, and caused a violent Inflammation: In a Letter from Mr. Arderon. F. R. S. to Mr. Baker, F. R. S. JOHN WOOD, Esq; of the City of Norwich, being afflicted with great Pain, and a violent Inflammation, in one of his Feet, applied to Mr. Castil, an eminent Surgeon, for his Assistance; who, upon strict Examination, perceived a few ~ Hairs sticking out, not far above the Setting on of the little Toe. Their Thickness, and particular Manner of standing out, A B put him upon taking hold of them with his Forceps; when, to his great Surprize, he extracted a large Hog's Bristle, of the Size shewn in the Margin, where the prick'd Line A B denotes how far it was buried in the Flesh. Read May 15. 1746. The Gentleman had immediate Ease, and grew well in a few Days, without any other Assistance. And he can't give the least Guess how the Bristle got into his Foot; unless by some Accident it slipped into his Stocking, and from thence worked its Way in. Had Mr. Wood deferr'd his Application to a Surgeon, till the Bristle had been intirely buried in his Foot, how miserable might he have been? What dreadful Operations in Surgery might he not have undergone, without the least Probability of having [193] having his Malady found out, or obtaining a Cure for it? 'Tis not unlikely, that many desperate Cases in Surgery may arise from such Accidents as this. V.
