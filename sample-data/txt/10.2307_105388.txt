[466] XLII. Observations on the same Comet; by the Rev. John Michell, M. A. Fellow of Queen's College in Cambridge. In a Letter to Mr. James Short, F. R. S. Dear Sir, THough in all probability you will have seen the comet, which is now apparent; yet, lest you should not, I was not willing to omit this opportunity of informing you of it. I received a message last night from Dr. Mason, who, as far as I find, was the first here, that discovered it. We did not suspect at first, that its apparent motion was so great, as it appeared to be on examination; or else should have taken more observations. Very luckily, however, I took its distance from four principal stars, between a quarter and half an hour after nine, which was as soon as I saw it; and, about an hour and a quarter after, finding that it had manifestly moved, to the naked eye, I took other observations of it, every quarter of an hour, or twenty minutes, till very near two o'clock, when it ceased to be visible, on account of its being too low in the mud. Read Jan. 10, 1760. The first observations gave its distance from K Orionis, 3~ 29~; from Rigel, 11~ 46~; from Betelgeuse, 17~ 10~; and from Syrius, 12~ 56~. All these observations were made between a quarter and half an hour past nine, and, as well as I could recollect, in the order I have set them down; which, not imagining [467] gining it was material, I had not been careful to mark to single minutes. At 1h 22~, its distance from Rigel was 7~ 6~; at 1h 24~, from Betelgeuse 15~ 53~; and at 1h 36~, its distance from Sirius was 17~ 36~. This will be sufficient for you to find its place by. The observations, together with above twenty others, were made with a little Hadley's quadrant, and may most of them, I believe, be depended on to about two or three minutes; but some perhaps may err four or five minutes. I am, Sir, Your obedient servant, John Michell. Cambridge, Jan. 9, 1760. XLIII.
