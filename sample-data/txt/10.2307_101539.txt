A Relation Of the loss of the Way to prepare the Bononian Stone for shining. Though several Persons have pretended to know the Art of preparing and calcining the Bononian Stone, for keeping a while the Light once imbibed; yet there hath been indeed but one, who had the true secret of performing it. This was an Ecclesiastick, who is now dead, without having left that skill of his to any one, as Letters from Italy and France, some while since, did inform. There is no substance, in Nature, known to us, that hath the effect of this Stone; so that (to the shame of the present Age) this Phaenomenon is not like to be found any where, but in Books, except some happy Genius light upon the same or the like skill*. [* It is hoped notwithstanding (which also a late Letter from abroad does hin:) that some or other of the Italian Vertnosi at Florence have secured this Secret.]
