5 1a7 ] VII. On the Theory of Definite Integrals. By W. H. L. RUSSELL, Esq., B.A. Communicated by A. CAYLEY, Esq., F.R.S. Received October 30,-Read November 23, 1854. I PROPOSE in the following paper to investigate some new methods for summing various kinds of series, including almost all of the more important which are met with in analysis, by means of definite integrals, and to apply the same to the evalnation of a large number of definite integrals. In a paper which appeared in the Cambridge and Dublin Mathematical Journal for May 1854, I applied certain of these series to the integration of linear differential equations by means of definite integrals. Now Professor BOOLE has shown, in an admirable memoir which appeared in the Philosophical Transactions for the year 1844, that the methods which he has invented for the integration of linear differential equations in finite terms, lead to the summation of numerous series of an exactly similar nature, whence it follows that the combination of his methods of summation with mine, will lead to the evaluation of a large number of definite integrals, as will be shown in this paper. It is hence evident that the discovery of other modes of summing these series by means of definite integrals must in all cases lead to the evaluation of new groups of definite integrals, as will also be shown in the following pages. I then point out that these investigations are equivalent to finding all the more important definite integrals whose values can be obtained in finite terms by the solution of linear differential equations with variable coefficients. Again, there are certain algebraical equations which can be solved at once by LAGRANGE'S series, and by common algebraical processes ; the summation of the former by means of definite integrals affords us a new class of results, which I next consider. A continental mathematician, M. SMAASEN, has given, in a recent volume of CRELLE'S Journal, certain methods of combining series together which give us the means of reducing various multiple integrals to single ones. The series hitherto considered are what have been denominated "factorial series"; but, lastly, I proceed to show that analogous processes extend to series of a very complicated nature and of an entirely different form, and for that purpose sum by means of definite integrals certain series whose values are obtained in finite terms in the 'Exercices des Math6matiques' by means of the Residual Calculus. The total result will be the evaluation of an enormous number of definite integrals on an entirely new tvpe, and the application of definite integrals to the summation of many intricate series.

If the series to be summed is of the nature of both the kinds of series we have been discussing, we must combine the two methods of summation together. Now consider the following differential equation: u+@(D)C'ou=0, where s=x. This equation can always be satisfied when the factors in the denominator of P(D) are real and unequal by a series of the form alp+~/f~7I.

Then the sum of this series by means of definite integrals can always be found by the preceding theorems. Now Professor BOOLE has given, in the mnemnoir I have before mentioned, the conditions which are necessary in order that the equation u+p(D)S'u=O may be integrable inl finite terms, which are therefore the conditions that the sum of the above series, and consequently the value of any definite integral equivalent to it, may be found in finite terms. I shall now give some instances of the evaluation of definite integrals by the application of these principles Let us consider the symbolical equa' tion 2E20u u ( D( _4 =()-, where so-x, (D-1)(D-4)and assume for its solution 0 so that u=(D-2)v, whence vC1X6'+C2xeC.

I have introduced them here partly for the sake of system, and partly because we shall require the series which they represent on other occasions. 162 MR. W. H. L. RUSSELL ON THE THEORY OF DEFINITE INTEGRALS. We may extend this process, by performing operations with respect to the quantity (s). Thus we may operate on any of the integrals we have obtained by such a symbol as F(dp), where F is any rational function; and if it is an entire function, we have merely differentiations to perform. If it is a rational fraction, and the factors of the denominator are real and unequal, we may decompose it into simple rational fractions, each of which may, in its turn, be transformed into a simple integral. If we apply this operation to any of the results we have obtained, we immediately have a definite integral f..PYQF(Q) dv... dd... expressed in a series of single integrals, where the integrations are performed with respect to (p), and (p) may be taken between any limits. But (p) must in no case pass through zero, as the definite integrals, on which we operate with respect to (s), cannot be found for that value of p by the processes we have been investigating. There are many other operations of a similar nature, which it is easy to imagine. I am now come to the second part of this memoir, the investigation of those new methods of summation, and of the definite integrals corresponding to them, to which I have before alluded. Let us consider the series e S~~~~~~I where (+) is an integer. The following integral is known: dO Sacoscos(a sin d)cos nd=*.i3 1 dO --*ac,) dos acos (a sin 4)s 6Ii.

W. H. L. RUSSELL ON THE THEORY OF DEFINITE INTEGRALS. Thie use of this integral will give an important extension of the method I have employed for expressing the integrals of differential equations by means of definite integrals. For in order to the success of that method, it is necessary, as is shown in my paper in the Cambridge Mathematical Journal before alluded to, that the magnitude of the factorials (if any) in the numerator of each term of the series to be summed, should be less than that of the corresponding factorials in the denominator; whereas this integral enables us to sum series in which the reverse is the case. I shall now apply the series, whose sum we have just found, to the evaluation of definite integrals, using series VI. and VII.

I shall now offer a few observations on the nature of the integrals we have been discussing. The preceding investigations appear to be equivalent to a solution of the following problem:-" To find the definite integrals, whose values can be determined in finite terms by the solution of linear differential equations with variable coefficients." It should seem that the definite integrals, which we have considered in this paper, are the most general ones of any importance, whose values can be found in this way, for the following reasons:-If we expand any definite integral, which is a solution of a differential equation, and its equivalent in terms of the principal variable, and equate like powers of that variable, we obtain a series of definite integrals of a simpler kind, each equal to a fraction whose numerator and denominator consist of factorials, and can therefore be expressed by the products of Eulerian integrals, or to the sum of such fractions. Now I have employed all the more important definite integrals of this class, which are yet known, in the summation of the series which satisfy the differential equation (ax + dxY+ (a'xn-' + b 1) +&c.=; and as the properties of the Eulerian integrals have been much studied, and the integrals whose values are dependent on them consequently well known, it is probable that the definite integrals, which we have considered in this paper, embrace all the more important ones whose values can be determined in finite terms by the solution of the above equation. Were we to employ equations of a more general form, we should find that the successive terms of the series which express their solutions, would be given by equations of finite differences, in which the members equated to zero would each consist of more than two terms. Consequently we should be unable in the general case to sum the resulting series by means of definite integrals; and in those cases in which we might find this possible, the integration of the differential 2 A2 168 MR. W. H. L. RUSSELL ON THE THEORY OF DEFINITE INTEGRALS. equations in finite terms would be practicable in very few. cases. The following method of determining a well-known definite integral is here added, to show the connexion between previous investigations relative to definite integrals, and those given in the present memoir. r4t 6 We know that 1-r +_._ ._+ = 2 or I2 (2r)4 1.3(2r)6(3 1. 35 +&c =? 1.22 1.2.3.4 22 1.2.3.4.5.6 2 Hence remembering that fdz z2"'.-o= 1.3..2n-1 2" 2 we find ecos 2rz=-,rl. .30 2 I shall now enter on some investigations connected with LAGRANGE'S theorem.

The fundamental idea of the preceding calculations, as will be readily seen, is as folb lows: to reduce every term of the series proposed to besummed by means of definite integrals to the form of the general term of the series whose sum is given by the common exponential theorem, and then to find the sum of the whole quantity contained under the signs of integration by means of that theorem. The factorials in the numerator of each term may be taken in any order we please relative to those of the denominator, provided that the same relative order is observed in every term throughout the whole series;a moreover, we may use different integrals to expresas the MR. W. H. L. RUSSELL ON THE THEORY OF DEFINITE INTEGRALS. 173 same factorials, so that we can deduce the value of many definite integrals from one series. I shall now give an example of the summation of a factorial series of a somewhat different nature. Consider the series1lA a +j 2?2+(a2+2 (2+ + (q2 + 2r (a + 42) ...

In the 'Exercices de Math6matiques,' CAUCHY has proved that if z be a quantity of the form ?(cos p+i sin p), and zp(z) continually approach zero as g indefinitely increases whatever be p, then the residue of @(z) is equal to zero, the limits of ? being o and (x ), and those of n, r and -r. From this theorem he deduces the sums of certain series, which I shall presently consider; but must first give certain results which will be useful in the sequel.

Lastly, Vn= j f-fdv Hence, combining these integrals together, and substituting for 52X_ -, as before, we are able to transform the above series into one which can be summed by the ordinary rules.

Wherefore, combining these integrals, and transforming the other elements as before, we may find its sum by means of definite integrals. We may resolve n, into its partial fractions, and then find the sum of the series, which would be simpler. The transformation of so which I have used above, is due to Professor KuMM ER, who has applied it in the seventeenth volume of CRELLE'S Journal, in a paper to which I am indebted for many ideas relative to the connexion of definite integrals with series, to the expression of the series 1+q+q4+q9+ &c. and others of a similar nature by means of a definite integral. The integral SSi~nPtZ dZ was first applied to the summation of series, whose terms involve elements of the form _ by POISSON in his Memoir on the Distribution of Electricity in two electrized spheres, which mutually act upon each other. He proves that the cal178 MR. W. H. L.

The definite integral of POISSON given above occurs in the solution of a functional equation; and it is probable that series similar to those I have been discussing in this paper, may be useful in enabling us to express the solutions of other functional equations by definite integrals.
