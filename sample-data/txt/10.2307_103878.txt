English Settlements, NEWENGLAND, of which his Father the Honourable John Winthrop, Esq; the Elder, was the first Governor. T H E Fatigues of this great Undertaking took up too much of his Time, to allow him all that Leisure that was wish'd for by his learned Friends in Europe, for his publishing many curious Pieces which they had Reason to expect from him. His distant Abode from London, and his not putting his Name to his Writings, made him not so universally known as the Boyle's, the Wilkins's, or the Oldenburg's of his Days, nor his Name handed down to us with such general Applause. In Concert with these and other learned Friends, (as he often revisited England) he was one of those, who first form'd the Plan of the Royal Society; and had not the Civil Wars happily ended as they did, Mr. Boyle * and Dr. Wilkins, with several other learned Men, would have left England, and, out of Esteem for the most excel* As may appear in Letters from Mr. Boyle, Dr. Wilkins, Sir K. <inferred>Digby</inferred>, &c. to Mr. Winthrop. lent D E D I C A T I O N. lent and valuable Governor, JOHN WINTHROP the younger, would have retir'd to his new-born Colony, and there have establish'd that S O C I E T Y for promoting Natural Knowledge *, which these Gentlemen had formed, as it were, in Embryo among themselves; but which afterwards receiving the Protection of King CHARLES II. obtain'd the Style of R O Y A L, and hath since done so much Honour to the British Nations, as to be imitated by the several European Princes, who desir'd to be esteem'd the Patrons of Learning. W H E N the Royal Society was thus founded, it was his constant Care to shew a peculiar Regard to promote the Design of its Institution, by sending over many Specimens of the curious natural Productions of those Countries, and by communicating in Writing his Remarks upon them; some of which grace the earliest of our Transactions: And by a Letter from Mr. Oldenburg, written by Order of the Royal Society, Mr. Winthrop * Which not taking p'ace, his Father first founded the College at Cambridge in New-England, sinco known by the Name of Harvard-College. b 2 was D E D I C A T I O N. was in a particular manner invited to take upon him the Charge of being the chief Correspondent of the Royal Society in the West, as Sir Philiberto Vernatti was in the East-Indies *. Y O U, Sir, have imitated the Example of your worthy Ancestor: Your Regard to the Royal Society shew'd itself from your Youth; you having sent to England many rare Curiosities for the Museum of the Royal Society, which, although by the Disingenuity of the Pilot they miss'd their Port, and were not laid up in the intended Repository, are some of them to be seen in a recent Museum now at Cambridge.

Since Mr. Colwall, the Founder of the Museum of the Royal Society, you have been the Benefactor who has given the most numerous Collection; and it is to be hoped your generous Example will be followed by some of the present Members, by which means our Repository may soon become one of the most conspicuous in Europe.
