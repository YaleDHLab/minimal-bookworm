XII. An Account of the Discovery of the Remains of a City under-ground, near Naples; communicated to the ROYAL SOCIETY by William Sloane, Esq; F. R. S. A T Resina, about four Miles from Naples, under the Mountain, within half a Mile of the Seaside, there is a Well in a poor Man's Yard, down which about 30 Yards there is a Hole, which some People have the Curiosity to creep into, and may afterwards creep a good way under-ground, and with Lights find Foundations of Houses and Streets, which, by some it is said, was in the Time of the Romans a City called Aretina, others say Port Hercules, where the Romans usually embarked from for Africa. I have seen the Well, which is deep, and a good Depth of Water at the Bottom, that I never cared to venture down, being heavy, and the Ropes bad. This City, it is thought, was overwhelmed by an Eruption [346] Eruption of the Mountain Vesuvius, not sunk by Earthquakes, as were Cuma, Baia, Trepergola, &c. Naples, March 7. 1731-2. Signed, William Hammond. S I R, In pursuance to your Desire, the above Account is transmitted me by my Partner, about the City you mentioned under-ground near Naples. I am very respectfully S I R, Your most humble Servant, John Green.
