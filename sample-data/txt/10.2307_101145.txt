An Advertisement about a New size of Globes rectified. There is lately set forth a New sze of Globes about 15 Inches diameter, Celestial and Terrestial. In the former, not only the Right Ascensuns and Declinations of several Stars are rectified; but the Constellations are so saintly and curiously represented, that the Fixt Stars appear much more conspicuous, than in any other extent: In the extant: In the latter there is scarce any part of the Earth, wherein a considerable alteration hath not been made; so that Asia and America are in a manner new, and much different from what hath-been hitherto drawn upon a Globe: The Eastern part of Asia rectified more than 10 degrees; and many places in Europe, Africa and America more than 5 degree: many eminent Towns inserted, that were wholly omitted in others: The Longitudes and Latitudes of most places being now corrected and adjusted not only by late Discoveries, but also by Trigonometrical Calculation, and the more accurate Clerical Observations of modern Authors; the names of whom, together with a further account of the Reasons of such differences and alterations, shall be more at large expressed in a Treatise designed for the Use of these Globes by R. Morden, at the Atlas in Cornhil, and William Berry at the Globe between York-house and the NewExchange in the Strand, London; who are the two persons that sent in this Advertisement.
