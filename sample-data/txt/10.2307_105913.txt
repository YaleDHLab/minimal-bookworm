[502] XLI. Observations of Immersions and Emersions of Jupiter's first Satellite, made at Funchal, in Madeira, with a reflecting Telescope of 18 Inches Focus, made by Mr. Short. The Time was sound by taking equal Altitudes, with a Quadrant of 12 Inches radius, made by Mr. Bird, and with the help of a good Pendulum Clock made in London. By the late Thomas Heberden, M. D.
