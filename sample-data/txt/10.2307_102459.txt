(192) IV. A Post-script of a Letter, bearing Date August the 4th. 1694. from Warrington in Northampton-shire. ON Wednesday last (being the first Instant) there happened here, betwixt the hours of One and Two of the Clock in the Afternoon, a very terrible Whirl-wind amongst the Shocks of Corn, in that part of Acrement Close, which is in the Possession of Mr. Holt, and took up into the Air about 80 or 100 Shocks, carried a great deal quite out of sight, the rest it scattered about the Field, or on the tops of the Houses or Trees thereabouts. I have seen of the Corn, which was carryed a Mile distant from the Field; and it is reported by Persons of good Credit, that some was carryed four or five Miles distant. The Whirl-wind continued in Acrement Close full half an hour; I my self, and several other Persons saw at least three or four Waggon-Loads of Corn all at once whirled about in the Air. The Letter was written to a Reverend Divine now in London, from an Inhabitant of Warrington, a very Sober and Credible Person. L O N D O N: Printed for Sam. Smith, and Benj.
