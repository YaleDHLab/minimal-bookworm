Francisci Dele Boe Sylvii PRAXIS MEDICAE Idea nova, Lib. I. The Variations Of the Magnetick Needle predicted for many years following. THe Doctrine of the Magnet and Magnetical Motions is yet so obscure, that what hitherto hath been discoursed and written upon that Subject, proves very unsatisfactory to Men, Tttt that (790) that consider the various Phaenomena and effects of that Body. Whence we presume, it cannot be un-acceptable to Philosophical Men, to be still furnisht with new conjectures, and fresh occasions, serving to excite new thoughts, and to make farther Inquiries concerning this matter. For which purpose we shall here communicate to the Curious a Table, directing them to make Observations for the future, whereby a certain Hypothesis is designed to be confirm'd, which an Intelligent Mathematician and Teacher of Navigation in England (Mr. Henry Bond) entertains, but thinks not yet fit to declare to the World: 'Tis by vertue of that Hypothesis, that he hath Calculated the following Table; shewing, How the Variations of the Magnetick Needle will fall out for the years therein specified; which he conceives to be now Westward, and to have been so for some few years last past; whereas they were formerly Eastward. This Philosophical prediction is here made publick, to the end that Inquisitive Men may every where from time to time make Observations accordingly, either to verify or to invalidate the pretended Theory.
