MATTHIESSEN, P. .5., Lecturer on Chernistry i b St. Mary's lobsital Medical School, and G. C. FOSTER, B.A., Professor of Physics in Untiversity College, London. Received lay 23,-Read June 20, 1867. ABOUT four years ago we had the honour of communicating to the Royal Society a paper entitled " Researches into the Chemical Constitution of Narcotine, and of its Products of Decomposition"@, and we now desire to lay before the Society some results obtained in the further prosecution of the same inquiry. We are fully aware that our present communication is in many respects very incomplete, but as we have no prospect of being able to resume the investigation conjointly, we venture to present the results already obtained as they are. In the previous paper it was shown that narcotine and its principal derivatives, opiuanic acid, meconin, hemipinic acid, and cotarnine, are decomposed when heated with hydrochloric acid or hyciriodic acid into iodide or chloride of methyl, and one or more other products. W ith the exception, however, of those obtained from hemipinic acid and cotarnine these second products had not been examined: the present memoir relates principally to the further study of these reactions. 1. Action of Hydrochloric and Hlydriodic Acids oa Op anic Acid. When opianic acid is heated to 1000 or 1100 with three or four times its weight of strong hydrochloric acid, either in a sealed tube or in an open flask, under a layer of paraffint for about twenty hours, or with about twice its weight of fuming hydriodic acid, and evaporated to dryness on a water-bath, chloride or iodide of methyl is produced, and at the same time a crystalline acid containing C9H 05. The reaction may be represented by the equation CIOHo1 11 + HlCl C911Hs -{+ CIH3CG. For reasons indicated in our former paper4, and more fully developed in the Journal of the Chemical Society?, we regard opianic acid as the dimethylized derivative of aPhilosophical Transactions, 1863, p. 345; for abstracts see Proc. Roy. Soc. vol. xi. p. 55, and vol. xii. p. 501. t When preparing a large quantity of this or any other substance by the action of hydrochloric acid this method is very advantageous, as there is no danger of loss by bursting as often happens with sealed tubes. In preparing a new base from narcotine, where we employed 200 grms. at each operation, the saving of time and expenso by using this method was very great. + Philosophical Transactions, 1863, p. 365. ?

Hence it appears that the acid dissolves in less than a quarter of its weight of hot water; in cold water, however, it is only sparingly soluble. It is easily soluble in alcohol, but almost insoluble in ether. Like hypogallic acid it strikes a dark blue with perchloride of iron, but, on addition * All the combustions given in this paper were made with oxide of copper and oxygen. t For these and other like deter inations the substance was first drained on filter-paper and then pr ssed Between two pieces of wood in a strong vice, the paper being renewed until it was no longer wetted.

To determine the basicity of the acid, the ammonium salt was precipitated by nitrate of silver, which forms a gelatinous precipitate becoming crystalline on standing. It is soluble in hot water, from which it crystallizes on cooling. This salt, dried at 1000 and heated to redness, gave the following results: I. 0 521 grim. gave 0-185 grm. metallic silver.

It therefore appears that methyl-noropianic acid is monobasic. The fact that opi anic acid when heated with excess of strong caustic potash splits up into meconin and hemipinic acid, leads us to hope that methyl-noropianic acid would with the same reagent undergo a similar decomposition. It was, however, found that the acid remains unaltered; for after treating it with strong caustic potash, a silver-salt was made, which yielded on ignition 35-5 per cent. silver, methyl-noropianate of silver requiring 35 64 per cent. The reduction of opianic acid to meconin by the action of sodium-amalgam caused us to try this reagent on the new acid, but here again we could not produce the corresponding reduction. When methyl-noropianic acid is dissolved in cold water, and about a sixth of its volume of strong nitric acid added, an action immediately sets up, and the solution becomes dark from nitric oxide and afterwards again light, when a nitro-acid crystallizes out. To prevent the action going on too far the solution must be kept cold. This new nitro-acid contains C9 117 NO7 C9 H7 (NO2) 05. We have called this acid nitromethyl-noropianic acid.

In our former paper we have (p. 355) described the action of hydriodic acid on hemipinic acid. We there stated that when hemipinic acid is treated with hydriodic acid the following reaction takes place CQ Ho 06+2H1 =C O2-F2C H3 I+C7 11604, The acid C7'H1604 we called hypogallic acid. We also mentioned (p. 359) that when hemipinic acid is heated with strong hydrochloric acid, the reaction is CIO0 O 06+11 Cl=C 02+C H3 Cl+C5 11 04.The further investigation and analyses confirm this formula, C8H8 04, for this acid; and as it contains one molecule of methyl more than hypogallic acid, and may be converted into that, body by the prolonged actiQn of hydrochloric acid, it may be called methyl-hypogallic acid. One of the simplest modes of preparing this acid is to digest the hemipinic acid with strong hydrochloric acid on a water-bath at 1000 C. under a layer of paraffin for about three days. The purification of the acid is very simple, owing to its being almost insoluble in. cold and sparingly soluble in hot water, whence it crystallizes out on cooling in long transparent prisms. The crystals contain no water of crystallization. I. 0A4020 grin. gave 0'8460 grm. carbonic acid and O)1786 grm. water. II. 05140 grm. gave 1'0700 grm. carbonic acid and 0'2276 grm. water.

Whilst experimenting with hemipinic acid we found that this acid may crystallize in different forms. The crystals were found to contain different amounts of water; thus (I.) when crystallized from a dilute solution by spontaneous evaporation, the crystals contain half a molecule of water; (IL) when from a supersaturated solution, they contain one molecule; and lastly, (III.) when crystallized in the ordinary way by cooling a hot solution, they contain two molecules.

When narcotine is treated with strong hydrochloric acid for some time on a waterbath, in a flask under a layer of paraffin, a thick oily mass gradually separates out on cooling, which on examination was found to be the chloride of a new base. The best method of preparing this base is as follows ;200 grins. narcotine are put into a large flask with 1000 cub. centims. strong hydrochlloric acid (the pure commercial acid),, and are digested together onB a water-bathl 664 DR. A. MATTHIIESSEN AND MR. G. IC. FOSTER ON under a layer of paraffin at 100 C. Much chloride of methyl is given of, and a thick oily mass separates out on cooling, and when no further quantity is formed the reaction may be considered finished*. The reaction which takes place may be written thus0221123 N 07+2H C1=C90 H19 N 07+2C H301. To purify the chloride, and to obtain the base from it, advantage is taken of the fact that it is comparatively insoluble in dilute hydrochloric acid, whereas in strong hydrochloric acid as well as in pure water it dissolves readily. After the reaction is finished the contents of the flask are allowed to cool. The liquid portion (strongly acid) is poured into a large beaker, and the oily mass dissolved in hot water, allowed to cool, and then poured into the strongly acid solution. This causes a precipitate, and water or hydrochloric acid is added in case either produce a further precipitate. The precipitated chloride is collected on a filter and washed with dilute hydrochloric acid (1 part acid, 9 parts water); after washing, the precipitate is dissolved in water, and carbonate of sodium added in excess, in which the new base is soluble, but narcotine insoluble; after filtering off any undecomposed narcotine, the solution is carefully neutralized with hydrochloric acid to precipitate the base, which becomes curdy on heating and may be filtered and washed with ease. After being well washed it is redissolved in hydrochloric acid, and fractionally precipitated with carbonate of sodium. The first portion precipitated contained most of the colouring-matter; the second portion was used for analysis. Dried at 1000 C. in a LIEBIG'S drying tube, it gave the following results I. 0-3026 grm. gave 0'6766 carbonic acid and 0l1354 grim. water.

THE CHEMICAL CONSTITUTION OF NARCOTINE. 665 I. and IL were of the same preparation, III., IV., V. were each of different preparations. For reasons which will be clear from what follows, we have called the base methylnornarcotine. When freshly precipitated it forms, an; almost white amorphous powder, insoluble in water and ether, slightly soluble in alcohol, and easily soluble in carbonate of sodium, by which means it may be separated from narcotine. None of its salts form crystalline compounds (the chloride, sulphate, and nitrate have been. tried). On determining the amount of chlorine and sulphuric acid in the chloride and sulphate, the following results were obtained: 1'731 grm. chloride gave 0 594 grm. chloride of silver. Calculated. Found.

The Achorid was prepared as follows: the base was dissolved in strong hydrochloric acid and fractiona precipitated by water, the middle portion collected, washed with dilute hydrochloric-acid, and dried over sulphuric acid and lime, before drying it in the water-bath. The chloride must not be washed with pure water, as it converts it immediately intb a sticky mass. The sulphate was precipitated by dissolving the base in sulphuric acid (one part acid, three parts water) and pouring the solution into water, collecting the precipitated sulphate and washing with water, redissolving the precipitate in hot water, and collecting the sulphate as it separates out in different portions. Like the chloride it must be first dried over sulphuric acid, and then in a water-bath. It may beas well to mention that in the further prosecution of this research, one of us has already obtained two more bases from narcotine. The one by digesting it for a short time with hydrochloric acid, and the other as indicated in. our former paper (p. 303), bye the :actin of hydriodic acid on it. The reactions may be writtenI.

C22 H23 N , trimethyl-nornarcotine (or ordinary rnarcotine). It need hardly be mentioned that endeavours will be made to reform ordinary narcotine from the above derivatives, and to make ethylated narcotine, as the decomposition of this substance may lead to the formation of ethyl-opianic acid, and a series of acids homologous to those described in this paper. In conclusion we have much pleasure in thanking Messrs. MACFARLANE and Co. of Edinburgh, for their liberality in presenting us with a large quantity of pure narcotine with which the experiments above described were carried out. 6.
