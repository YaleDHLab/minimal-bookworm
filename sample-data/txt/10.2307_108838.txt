[ 437 ] XXX. On Simultaneous Diff.erential Equations of the Pirst Order in which the Number of the Variables exceeds by more than one the Number of the Equations. By GEORGE BOOLE, F.B.S., Professor of Mathematics in Queen's College, Cork. Received June 19,-Read June 19, 1862. IT is a fundamental proposition of analysis that a system of n differential equations of the first order containing n+1 variables admits of n integrals, each of which is expressed by a function of the variables equated to an arbitrary constant. But when a system of n differential equations of the first order connects n+r variables, r being greater than unity, no existing theory assigns in a general manner the number of theoretically possible integrals of the above species, or shows us how to discover them. Yet such cases are of great importance. I wish to develope here the theory of a method for the solution of the above classes of equations, which was published by me in the '-Proceedings of the Royal Society' for March 6th of the present year, and which enables us to assign the number of theoretically possible integrals, and to reduce their discovery to the solution of a system of simultaneous differential equations equal in number to the number of integrals, and expressible as exact differential equations. The solution of the problem as thus reduced may be effected by known methods, but I have thought it desirable to discuss this part of the subject also in direct sequence to the other, and in conformity with its method. Of the Connexion between ordinary and partial J)iff'erential Equations. It has been found convenient, in researches bearinLg upon the general theory of differential equations, to use the term 'integral' in two distinct senses, viz. to denote, as above, a relation satisfying the differential equation or system of equations, and expressed by the equating of a function of the variables to a constant, and to denote the function itself. The particular sense intended will always be shown by the connexion. With this convention two systems of differential equations will be said to be equivalent when they have in either of the above senses (and the one implies the other) the same system of integrals. This will explain the meaning of the following proposition. PROPOSITION I.-A system of n ordinary differential equations of the first order connecting n+r variables may be converted into an eguivalent system of r linear partial differential equations of tie first order.

We say ' the common integrals of which,' because in fact these equations express the conditions to all of which P must be subject in order that P=c may be an integral of the system (I.). The formal connexion between the systems (I.) and (II.) deserves to be carefully noticed. The several partial differential equations of the system (II.) may be formed by inspection from the columns in the right-hand member of the system (I.) by the following rule. For the differential dxn+i in any column write the differential coefficient dP dP dP dP , to this add the series of differential coefficients Z ' -v . . .dxz multiplied in succession by the descending coefficients of the column, and equate the final result to 0. The symmetrical form of the equation dP i dP 1 dP -7 EQUATIONS OF THE FIRST ORDER. 439 shows that by an exactly similar rule any system of n partial differential equations of the first order, the terms of which consist of the differential coefficients of P multiplied by functions of the independent variables xi, x,2,) . xn+,. may be converted into an equivalent system of r common differential equations of the first order. For the proposed system of partial differential equations is by algebraic reduction expressible in the form dP dP dP dP ' dWXA,1 ddx+, +A2 dx^+2 +AirdXn+r' dP d P dP ___ -A2d +A22dX+2 .+A2r dP ( dx2 .l ~ n2dXn+r' dP dP dP dP dx Anrdw +X +An2 d+ *e*+Anr dXn+r J dP dP dP If the values of d$, j d-, *. dx in this system be substituted in the previous general dP dP dP ~h equation, and the coefficients of the differential coefficients d,-, @.d 'dxn+r the dzn+ 1 W~n+2 dnr result be separately equated to 0, we shall have dx,+,+All dx,+A21 dx2 ...+A., dx, 0, dx,+,+A,2 dx,+A22 dx2 Z+ An2 d~non-:S* m*i (IV.) dxn+r+Al dx, +A2r dx2.2 .+An, dx, = 0. J These, equations nmay in like-manner be formed by inspection from the columns of dP the second member of (III.), by writing for in any column dxj, adding to this dxj, dx2,... dxn multiplied by the descending coefficients of the column, and equating the final sum to 0. The rule for the one case differs from that for the other only in that differentials take the place of differential coefficients. As an objection may be felt to the legitimacy of that step of the above process in dP dP dP which, the differential coefficients Xi ' X. being eliminated, the coefficients of the remaining ones are separately equated to 0, I will point out another mode of procedure which leads to the same result, and which is founded upon LAGRANGE'S method of solution. Let the equations of the system (III.) be added together after having been multiplied respectively by ?q, x2,.. ,n) which are to be regarded as indeterminate functions of the variables xl, X2, X..r. The result will be a linear partial differential equation of the first order, of which the Lagrangian auxiliary system of ordinary differential equations will be dLx, dx2 dXn -dx,+, -dnr_ Al1 A2 An AjlAl.. .+ Anal n, Air Al .+ Anr AN Hence, eliminating XI, ,2, ... Ban or more strictly speaking the ratios A, X2 ?, Xn_ An on2 440 PROFESSOR 1300LE ON SIMULTANEOUS DIFFERENTIAL we have A,, dx, ... .+A, dx,1 dx+, Ar dx, . +Ar drndxn~ r which agrees with the system (IV.). Of the Determination of the Number of Integrals of a system of Differential Equations of the First Order and Degree. We still suppose the given system of differential equations to be expressed under the general form (I.), and reduced by Prop. I. to the equivalent partial differential system (II.). Now if for the expression of that system we introduce a series of symbols A2, ... A, defined as follows, viz. d ~~d dd =d,+i + l d.(1.) the system will assume the form AiP=O, A2P0, ArP=0. . * (2.) and we shall now establish the following proposition PROPOSITION H.-fIf AjPI 0, AP= 0 represent any two linear partial differential equations of the system (II.), then will the equation of which the symbolical expression is (AAjAjA)PO .. = +*** (3.) also be a linear partial differential equation of the first order, and it will be satisfied by all the common integrals of the two equations from which it is formed. For, representing any one of the quantities xw, ;, .. *, by x, and any function of those d quantities by X, Ai consists of a series of terms of the form X da Again, representing any one of the same series of quantities xl, X2, ... 0n by y, and any function of themby Y, A4 will consist of terms of the form Y d. Hence (A1A2A2AJ)P will consist of terms of the form (Xd Y -Y X 4)P. Effecting the differentiations, this term becomes dY dP+Xy d2P dX dP d_ P dx dy dx dy 4 'ar X dxdy or dY dP dX dP XdY--Yy 7which involves only the first differential coefficients of P. Hence (3.) will be a linear partial differential equation of the first order. Hence also the ultimate form of (3.) will be the same as if Ai, when operating on A?,) operated only On the coefficients A,1J.. * A 3 involved inl A>, and vice versei. Thus the EQUATIONS OF THE FIRST ORDER. 441 ultimate form of (3.) will be dP dP dP (A A X.-.1A1i) + ~.+(A;A,0.A3AA.)A-=-O. . (4.) Secondly, the equation (AiAjAj3A)P=O will be satisfied by any common integral of AP=O and AP==O. For let p=c be a common integral of the latter equations. Then, identically, At@=O0 Ajr=O; therefore, since A. and A, involve only operations of differentiation together with algebraic ones, AjAtp=O, AiAjP=O; .*0 AiAjp-AjAjP-=; whence (3.) is also identically satisfied. PROPOSITION III.-If, by the successive application of Prop. II., and by permitted processes of algebraic elimination, we derive from, the system of partial differential equations AIP=?, A2P = ? .. . r _ 0 into which the given system of differential equations has been converted, afinal system of partial defferential equations which, while including the above system, shall be such that the applitcation of Prop. II. to any pair of the equations contained shall lead only to an identity, then the number of integrals of the given system of differential equations will be equal to the number of variables they contain, diminished by the number of partial differential equations qf the above final system.. The developed form of the system AzP=0, IA2P=0, ... ArP=O.(1.) is the following dPdP dP do+A~ld-** +Anlqkr=0, dx71+, "dxj xn dP +AdP *A2dP__ol dx+2 A12 dxl d i . (2.) dP dP dP d-+r+Alrdxi ..+Anr =0O Comparing these with (4.), Prop. II., which is the developed form of the equation (Aj-AjA)P=0, we see that the latter equation is necessarily algebraically independent of the above system; for no equation derived from that system by algebraic processes ,dP dP could be free, as (4.) is, from all the differential coefficients Again, as (4ANA)P=O is satisfied by all the common integrals of AP=0 and AjP=01 it follows that the system of r+1 equations, AjP=PO ... A..P=?. (AA.-A. AOP . (3.) will be satisfied by all the common integrals of the system (1.). To this system of r?1 442 PROFESSOR 3OOLE ON SIMULTANEOUS DIFFERENTIAL equations we can also give a form analogous to the developed form of the system (2.). It will be noticed that the differential coefficients ,.P ..A appear there, each in only one equation, and each with the coefficient unity. Now let the last equation of (3.) in its developed form be divided by the coefficient of ?P, and let also the value of dxs, _P which it gives be substituted in the other equations of (3.); then we shall have in dx, the whole a system of n+1 equations possessing the same general character as the system (2.). To this new system the same procedure may be applied, viz. the genesis of a new equation by means of Prop. II., and the transference of another differential dP coefficient d, to the list of those which form the respective first terms of the equations of the system. We will suppose this procedure to have been repeated until a system composed of m partial differential equations such that the further application of Prop. II. leads only to identities has been formed. If n+r -m=p, that system will be of the form dP dP dP dx,+ 11, dl +FPI dz= dxp+2m+H2 dXj ..m-HP2dXp '.(4.) dP dP dP d +Hm?H ... +Hp nj =0. And if, in analogy with former notation, we write d d d it will take the symbolical form AP=O. A2P=.... AmP=O; but it will differ from all former systems of equations in that all the conditions represented by ( ~&P= . .e**@*(5.) will be identically satisfied,-satisfied, in consequence not of any ascertained peculiarity of the integral P, but of the constitution of the system of symbols Al, A2, . . *Am The course of argument has shown that the common integrals of the system (4.) will be identical with those of the parent system (2.). Now we shall show that the existence of the condition (5.) renders the integration theoretically possible; that the system of p ordinary differential equations into which, by Prop. II., the final system of partial differential equations (4.) is resolvable admits of exactly p integrals. As pA=nr-nm, this is to say that the'number of integrals is equal to the number of original variables diminished by the number of final partial differential equations. EQUATIONS OF THE FIRST ORDER. 443 The proof of this will consist of two parts :-Ist. It will be shown that, if a system of p integrals exists, the conditions represented by (8.) will be identically satisfied. 2ndly. It will be shown that, when the conditions represented by (5.) are identically satisfied, the solution either of the final system of partial differential equations (4.), or of the corresponding system of ordinary differential equations, by a system of p integrals is theoretically possible. It will follow from these conjoined, that the number of actually existing integrals is exactly p. 1st. The system of ordinary differential equations corresponding to (4.) may be expressed in the formdxllH,1dxp+1+H12dxp+2 ,... +Hlmdxp+m, v . . .. * .: . . . * * > . . . + * (6.) dxp=H-pldxpp++Hp2dxp+2 ak +Hpmdxp+,m 3 Now suppose this system to have p integrals. Then, by means of these, xw, x2, ... xP can be eliminated from the coefficients H1,, &c. in the second members, which will thus become exact differentials of those functions of the variables xp+1 ... xp+, which express the values of xi, ... xp. Hence we shall have the system of conditions dZH H(7= H ... (7) k representing any integer from 1 to p, and i, j any integers from 1 to m, and the bracketed symbols of differentiation referring to Hkj, HIk as transformed. Hence, the unbracketed symbols referring to the prior state of the functions, we have (d d dx d dxp d In the same way .~~~~~ ~~~~~~~~~ . f.q /~~~~ dd tdxp+jJAj; so that (7.) becomes AiHkj JHki=-? 8 Now if we construct, in analogy with (4.), Prop. II., the developed form 'of the conditional equation (5.) of the present section, we shall have (AiHii A^Hli) d'. 4 + (AiHrj AyHp) dXP 01 or, E denoting summation from k=1 to k=p, I(AiHlkj AHki)dPk = 0 Now as by (8.) the coefficients vanish identically, the equation, and generally the system of conditional equations of which it is the type, will be identically satisfied. 444 PROFESSOR BOOLE ON SIMULTANEOUS DIFFERENTIAL 2ndly. We proceed to show that the system of en linear partial differential equations (7.), represented under the form AYP=05 A2P--?j . .. AMPO and satisfying identically the system of conditions represented by ('AA4-4A)P=01 will admit of p integrals expressing distinct values of P; and the system of ordinary differential equations (6.) corresponding to the above system of partial differential equations will be -expressible as a system of exact differential equations, and will, by integration give the above systems of integrals. Beginning with the first partial differential equation. of. the system (4.), and forming the corresponding Lagrangian system of ordinary differential equations d dce1 dxpv dx,+l =n .*= -I dx,+2=O, dxp+mO, we see that the integrals of this system will be of the form U1 =.l . . q =Cp, iXp+2=ep+2 *.* *p+m=Cp+m) 4Z1... u, being functions of all the variables xja ... xcpm among which, by virtue of the integrals of the second line, Sp+2 .+m may be regarded as constant. The general integral will be F(it, ,. * , * p 2 . the form of F being perfectly arbitrary. Now the general form of any equation of the system (4.) is dP dP dP dHjj ". # +Hp =0 .(9) Let us transform this by assuming .. i ,1 ** H ip +1 * Xp+m as independent variables. Then referring the right-hand members of the following equations to the new, the left-hand to the old system of variables, we have dP dP dP du dP du? d<+ gdx+Jr du1 dp+( * * dIb daca' d TU dX + dtl _ dPdo dP dP dul dP dup dx-1 du ax, + dup dCI11 dP dP du ~ dP du-, EQUATIONS 0F THE FIRST ORDER. 445 whence, substituting in (9.), dP dP *du d + H dup dP / du dup du',) 0 + +Hi **Hv -o, or dP dP dP and in this equation we may give to i the successive values 1, 2, .. .p. If, then, we write d d + A )d =A dxp+, +( du,) . *-du, we see that the proposed transformation will have the effect of converting into A 1) 2X * *A respectively, and the system of partial differential equations into AiP=O, A2P=05 ... AP=O. The developed form of the first of these equations is _ _ _ _ d P dzP+ + (/At6) ul) * *. 1 + (A utp) dP ?. But since ua, ... u, are integrals of A P-O, we have zt1u1=? 0,.. zlup-OX so that the equation A'P=O reduces to dPa dP = 0. We learn from this that Xp+1 will not explicitly appear in P after the transformation which introduces ub ... Up. The developed form of the remaining p-I equations represented by (10.) will be d _p+2+(/2z&1) gut e + (t?2 p0 dP A .dP . e+(A dP . . . (11d) and we shall next show that the variable xP+1 will not present itself in the coefficients (A2UI), &c. The general form of such coefficients is itu, where i has any value from 2 to m, and .s any value from 1 to p. Now if in (5.), which is true independently of the nature of the function P. we make MDCCCLxII. 3 p 446 PROFESSOR BOOLE ON SIMULTANEOIS DIFFERENTIAL j=1 and P=u8, we have (Al~~~AlA)u.s= 0.' But Ay. = 0; therefore, by the above, A' AX S' Now A\i is expressible at most as a function of u,, ... p zp+1 ... wp+m* But this transformation converts, as has been seen, A, into dd . Thus we have d' d = Au 0=, so that Azmu is free from xo+,. Thus the system (11.) is free from opa. Lastly, since by the above transformation A2 . Ap are converted into L .,. Ap?, the system of conditions (/Aji-AjAj)P= 0 is converted into (hAz '-64)P o. It is thus seen that the -system ofp partial differential equations Alp = 09 AXO .'A~p= ?, containing +m independent variables x,, x2, x**p+m, and satisfying the conditions is convertible into a system of p-I partial differential equations, EP=-0 AgP=e0 AV'P=0 containing p+m-1 independent variables ut ... t9p, p?2 .. Xp*m, and satisfying the condition (AjAj-4Aj)P=O. And as this system possesses the same character as that upon which the previous transformation depended, it will admit of transformation into a system of p-2 partial differ. ential equations containing p+m-2 independent variables; and so on until we arriveat a single final partial differential equation containing p+l independent variables, and having therefore p distinct integrals, which will be the common integrals of the primary system of partial differential equations as well as of the -system of ordinary differential equations to which they correspond. Cor. The property of the coefficients 2j,, &c. of the system (11.), of being free from the variable Spell enables us, by properly determining the integrals of the partial differential equation AlP = 0, to reduce "the system to a form of great simplicity. Let 4juj be any one. of those coefficients. Its developed, form is (dlr H~iwx, s, -uPidp )ij .** ..(12.) Now as this expression will, after the performance of the differentiations, be free from xp+l, and as the differentiations are none of them with respect to xp+,l we can give -tQ x,-in it any particular value before differentiation without affecting'the final result. Let us then suppose that in Hll, ... Hpi, and in u>, xpal is made equal to 0. Now it is possible so to determinie the integrals u> as functions -of the variables Xi.),, a. p~r, that tQUATIONSOF TIM FIRSTORDER. 4471 when xpi=O each uy shall reduce to x,. For this purpose it ig only necessary to choose as arbitrary constants ta set of arbitrary values of xi, x ... x, corresponding to xpal=0. Let .i, , ... x, .be such arbitrary constants, and let the given system of integrals be reduced to the form:, u1t = c } &[, * *= p5 and the functions a,, ... uo, will possess the required property. Changing,, then, each U into -xa, the expression (1T2.) reduces to H11p and it only remains to express this.. in terms of u1, .,,. uap,which, as +1=0, is done by merely changing x . . s into V1,*... Up. Thus the -system (11.) is reduced to dP dP dP . + H2) +(Hp2) -W 0? dP ~~dP dP dxp+m ** Xi . * where the brackets denote that in the enclosed portion x a is to be made 0, and. xi le*., -p, ,converted. into qtUs V'21. U* Pe Now this form is identical, the above conversion of letters exceptedwith that of the: system (4.), omitting that equation of, the latter system by the integration of which the forms of u, .p. are determined. 'It follows frtom the 'above that,'obtaining the'integrals 'of A P-0 in 'such a form that the arbitrary constants shall represent the arbitrary values of xl. .x. xp when xpl=0, and representing, the functions which are equal to those arbitrary constants by x1l, x, ... then if in the remaining equations,A2P= 0 AmP=0 we change al, ... x x X , . -** to dx dX, 'I,'@P' d ,, @ d ,, and'-to 0, the common integrals oftthe transformed xjj , 1and xP, 1 and'dXn tgal f~he'rn' omd system of p-i will be the same as those of the previous system of p partial differential equations. In the same wvay a third system of p-2 partial differential equations may be formed, and so on,till we obtain a single final partial differential equation which will, have the common integrals of the parent system. By this method, which is due to. JACOBI and NUTANI, all the labour of the successive transformations is avoided. The successive integrals thus introduced are termed I Haupt-Integrale.' Instead of applying the foregoing methods, general or particular, to the final system of partial differential equations, we may apply it to the solution of the corresponding final system of ordinary differential equations. In this case they would really represent the' method 'of solution known as the variation of parameters, and the conditions (AijA1-AjA)P=O would secure the sufficiency of that method,. If, in: the. system of ordinary differential equations, (6.) we regard xSpas .., ,,+m as constant, we get d-x -HllxP+1=0,1 * ............. 0 (13.) 3asx 42= 448 PROFESSOR BOOLE ON SIMILTAANEOIUS DIERENTIAL Integrate this in the form then, treating c,, ... ep as functions of the variables before regarded as constant, and endeavouring to satisfy the unreduced equations (6.), we obtain, in virtue of the above. conditions, a system of differential equations equal in number to the system given, but containing one variable fewer. The system (13.) by which the forms of ul, ...up are here determined, is the Lagrangian auxiliary of the first partial differential equation AP= 0 integrated in the other method; and so in each subsequent stage. And with respect to the other parts of the process, it obviously makes no difference whether we take as the new variables u,, ... up, or c,,... ep under the condition (necessarily involved in the method of the variation of parameters) that they shall after integration be replaced by u,, ... uo. But it would not have sufficed simply to refer the solution of the final system of ordinary differential equations to the method of the variation of parameters, first, because the necessity and sufficiency of the conditions which form the ground of that method and are the warrant of its success were to be shown; secondly, because the connexion of the systems of ordinary differential equations which arise in the method of parameters with the successive partial differential equations forms an essential part of the demonstration. General Rule. The results of the foregoing inquiry may be collected into the following General Rule:To find the number p of possible integrals -of a system of n differential equations of the first order connecting n+r variables x,, x2, ... xq+,, and to determine those integrals. Rule.e-Suppose P an integral of the given system. Determine from the given system dir, dx2, ... dxn as functions of the other differentials. Substitute these values in the equation dP d Pld+ddd2 + dP dxn+r=O, and equate to 0 the coefficients of the remaining differentials. This will give a system of r partial differential equations of the form dpdP dP .+A..,.,..?A .P0 WX.+, dx, -x dP dP d r of the differential coefficients appearing each only in one equation and with coefficient unity. Representing these equations in the symbolical form A P=0 AP=O,... AP=O, deduce any equation or equations of the form (zt~-zA,9iP=0*. EQUATIONS OF THE FIRST ORDER. 449 If all such prove to be identities, the given system of differential equations admits of n integrals, and is reducible to a system of exact differential equations. But if any such equation is not an identity, it will constitute a new partial differential equation of the form B dP B dP ti 0. WXI+ +B dP And this, combined with the previous ones, will enable us to form a system of r+I partial differential equations, in which do ' dx, ' -dX appear each in only one equation and with coefficient unity. Upon this system let the same process be repeated as upon the previous system of r partial differential equations, and so continually repeated until we arrive at a final system of partial differential equations such that, if that system be represented in the form AP=O... A mP=O the condition (AzAj-Aj^$)P= 0 shall be identically satisfied for every pair. Then, the number of such partial differential equations being m, the number of integrals of the original system of partial differential equations will be n+r-m, i. e. it will be equal to the number of the original variables diminished by the number of final partial differential equations. And if by that final system we eliminate mn of the differential coefficients from dP dP dP dx dX1+WX dX2... +Xd x nr=0 and equate to 0 the coefficients of the remaining differential coefficients, we shall have a system of n+r-m differential equations expressible as exact differential equations for the determination of the integrals. Actually to determine these, we should endeavour in the first instance to reduce the final system of differential equations, as such reduction is theoretically possible, to a system of exact differential equations. If the means of doing this are not obvious, the method of the variation of parameters or the equivalent methods of Prop. III. must be applied. Lastly, if the process which consists in the application of the theorem (Aizs;Aji)P = 0 do not stop with the formation of the final system of partial differential equations, but lead to algebraic relations among the variables, the given system of differential equations will have no integrals properly so called, but it may admit of solutions analogous to those the theory of which has been developed by PFAFF, JACOBI, and others for the differential equation XIdx1+X dX, .. +Xxndan=0O.. 450 PROFESSOR~ BOOLE ON SIMULTANEOIYS ]D-IFP]ENTIAL Ayppcations. 1st. Suppose it required to find the number of integrals of the form Pwc, which the system of differential -equations dz=(t +xy+ xz)d +@(ct+y-z)dy, dt =(y+z 3x)d +(zt -y)dy admits, and to determine such integrals. Eliminating dz and dt from the equation dP dP dcP d% P dx j dy + Tdz + tdt=0 and equating to 0 the coefficients of dz and dt in the result, we have diP dcP dP dP dP dP -y +(x~zt+yy)-do +(zt) d-?

By substituting in (l1) and (2.) the value of hence obtained, we have the system of three equations, -P+(3X2+t)Tz=?O dP dP dP dP dt + dz =?0 Now if upon any two of these we repeat the same process as upon (1.) and (2.), we obtain; as the result 0=0. Thus the system of partial differential equations is complete., As then there are three equations in this final system, while the number of original variables was four, the primary system will admit of one integral of the form P c. To obtain this integral, eliminate dj,r=, dy.from the above equations and daPds dP + dP-7d:, dtP=O EQALTIONS. OF T2HE FIRST ORDER.4 and equate to 0 the coefficient of ' in the result. We find dz (t+ 3X2)dX-ydy.dt? 0, the integral of which is Z_t 3_X y2 =e. 2nd. The solution of the partial differential equation Rr+Ss+Tt+U(s2-rt)=V, as well as of the special equations Rr+Ss+Tt=V, Rr+Ss+Tt,+U(s2-rt) 0, the theory of which constitutes an exception to that of the more general form, depends, in general upon the integration of three simultaneous differential equations between five'variables. 'lTo this-integration the method of the foregoing sections is applicable. The only cases. for which the ,theory of the' ultimate solution can be said to be complete, are those in which the auxiliary system of common differential equations admits either three integrals of the form P c, or two integrals of that form. We may apply the method of the foregoing sections, not only to the determinationof the integrals, but also to the discovery of the a priori conditions connecting the coeffi, cients R, 8, T, II, Y in order that each of these species of integration may be possible. For example, the solution of the equation Rr+Ss+Tt+(s2-rt) =V depending upon the integration of the system d]=-rnldx+Rdy, dp=-m2dy+Tdx, dz = Pdz +qdy, in which m, and m2 are roots of the equation 2m -Sm+RT-Y=0, let it be required to determine the conditions under which the system admits three integrals. Eliminating dq, dp, dz between the above equations and dP dP dP dP dP -dX+Yd -dz + -dp+ dx dq=0, and equating to 0 the coefficients of dx and dy in the result, we obtain two partial differentialeequations which may be thus represented, viz.

IHence the'equation (. A'A)p= 0 must vanish identically. Developing this, we have the conditions AR+Im1=0l, AM2+LA'T=0, ALq-LA=O. Now on performing the operations denoted by L\ and -f', the last equation gives m22-n1=0Hence referring to the quadratic, we see that S2-4RT+4V=0. . . . . (I.)

The first of the above conditions was given by AMPERE*,. The others are probably new. Satisfied, they enable us to predict that the partial differential equation under consideration admits a complete primitive involving three constants, and a general primitive arising from the variation of those constants in subjection to any two arbitrary conditions. 3rd. We have supposed each linear partial differential equation employed in the processes of this paper to be of the form A dP A2 dP + dP and we have supposed each system of partial differential equations which arises, to be so reduced that each equation shall have some one of the partial differential coefficients of P entering into it alone and with a coefficient equal to unity. The first of these conditions is virtually sufficiently general, because any linear partial differential equation can be deprived of its second member. The advantage of the second condition is that each newly-formed equation will be really new, and not an algebraic combination of the old ones. But neither of these conditions is necessary. From two linear partial differential equations of the form A1P=H, A2P K,, in which H and IK are functions of the independent variables, arises a new equation, (1A2-2)P= K-2H *e* * . (1.) which will be satisfied by all the simultaneous integrals of the equations from which it is derived. It may be rigorously proved that, in applying this process, the generated system* Journal de l'Ecole Polytechnique, Cahier 180.
