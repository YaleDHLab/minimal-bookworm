400 J XXIV.: On the Effect of westerly Winds in raiszng the Level of the British Ghannel. In a Letter to the Rig ht Hon. Sir Joseph Banks, Bart. K. B. P. R. S. By James Rennell, Esq. F. .u S. Read June 22-, 1809. DEAR SIR, IN' the" Observations on a Current that often prevails to the "Wt~estwuard of Scilly, which I had the honour to lay before the Royal Society many years ago, I slightly mentioned, asconnected with the same subject, the effect of strong westerly winds, in raising the level of the British Channel and the escape of the superincumbent waters, through the Strait of Dover, into -the thenlower level of, the North Sea. The recent loss of the Britannia East India ship, Captain WRCH, on the Goodwin Sands, has impressed this fact more strongly on my mind; as I have no doubt that her loss was occasioned by a current, produced byD the running off of the accumulated waters; a violent; gale, from the. westward then prevailing. The circumstances under whichshe was lost, were generally these: In January last she sailed from her anchorage between Dover and the South Forelandd (on her way to Portsmouth), and was soon -after assailed by a violent gale between the west and south-west. The thick weather preventing a view of the lights-, the pilot was left entirely to the reckoning and the lead; and when it was concluded that the ship was quite clear .o Mr. RENNELL on the Effects, &c. 401 the Goodwin, she struck on the north-eastern extremity of the southernmost of those sands. And this difference between the reckoning (after due allowance being made for the tidesand the actual position, I conclude was owing to the northerly stream of current, which caught the ship when she drif/ed to the back, or eastern side of the Goodwin. The fact of thle high level of the Channel, during strong winds, between the W. and SW., cannot be'doubted: because the increased height of the tides in the southern ports, at such. times, is obvious to every discerning eye. Indeed, the form of the upper part of the Channel, ill particular, is such as to receive and retain, for a time, the principal part of the water forced in as may be seen hy the sketch (No. i and as a partof this water is continually escaping by the Strait of Dover, it Nwill ; produce a current ; which must greatly disturb the ,reckonings of such ships as navigate the Strait, when thick weather prevents the land, or thelights of the Forelands, and the North Goodwin, from. being seen. I observe in a new publication -of Messrs. LAWRItE: and WWHITTLE, entitled"Sailing Directions, & c. forthe British Chantnel, i8o8,"' that -throughout the Channel, it is 10admitted by the experienced persons whom''. he quotes, that strong SW. winds" i cause the flood tide to ruin an: hour, or more, longer, " than at common times :" or in other words, that a cuzrrent overcomes the ebb tide, afull hour: not to mention how much it may accelerate the one, and retard he other, during the: remainder of the time,-" o It is also asserted, that in the mouth of the Chaninel, the extraordinary rise of tide, in stormy weather, is ten feet: that is, at common springs tweiity, and in stormsn-, thirty feet. See pages z,81 41, 70, and 133. 50! t'Mr. RENNELN On the Effect It is evident, that the direction of the current under consi. derations, will be influenced by the form and position of the opposite shores, at the entrance of the Strait; and as these are materially different, so must the direction of the stream, be, within the influence of each side, respectively. For instance, on the English side, the current having taken the direction. of the shore, between Dungeness and the South Foreland, will set generally to the north-east, through that side of the Strait. (See No. 1.) But, on the French side, circusn stances must be very different: for the shore of Boulogne trending almost due north will give the current a like direction, since it cannot turn sharp round the Point of Grisnez, tothe north-eas-tward ; but must preserve a great proportion of its northerly course, until it mixes with the waters of th North Sea. And it may be remarked, that the Britannia, when driven to the eastward of the Goodwin, would fall into this very line of current. There is another circumstance to be taken into the account; Which is, that the shore of Boulogne presenting a direct obstacle to the water impelled by the westerly winds, will occasion a higher level of the sea, there, than elsewhere; and, of course a stronger line of current towards the Goodwin. (See again No. 2.) It must, therefore be inferred, that a ship, passing the Strait of Dover, at the back of the Goodwin Sands, during the prevalence of strong W. or SW. winds, will be carried many miles to the northward of her reckoning; and if compelled to depend on it, may be subject to great hazard, from the Goodwin. It mill be understood, of course, that although the stream AT'e (iket d j hoft ) nd) T~~~~~~rt/Ofld ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ -olon*ye > N ~~Dungi A4 /w t~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ A~~fing-I (ikcta'ayl now 312]) Ant/ac) 2V~n1A Fori/anow Maiyak 4~~~~~~~~~~~~~~6ot~~~~~~~~~ 1t~~~-arnz t CIO~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~rr/via a/ I ?~~~~~~~~~LW JioatkForc/nd At I ivc L ights ~ A-C-Bye v -~ ~ fo I/ask,~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ s 2~~~~0 i l III I I-l o _ r aI t a c -Mi lt-~Ar svuizmcr J54dg>hznj.Ml)CiCUX'.faie XVITtp. 403. 2VrrtA Forelanti A ~OU~d I a/I bu tie X~or 1Ad it trd -A Goodwim ?anydstiom GeerlRoy' Dover m L 1AI I / <, ) t 11 rattac Miles. ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ (ilgu -l /1'is 0 ' i~~~~~~ ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ O Io He Io+Ww i of westerly Jinds, 403 of current, alone, has been considered here (in order to simplify the subject), yet that, in the application of these remarks, the regular tides must also be taken into the account. But from My ignorance of their detail, I can say no more than that I conceive that the great bodv of the tide from the Channel, must be subject to much the same laws, as the current itself. The opposite tide will doubtless occasion various inflexions of the current, as it blends itself with it ; or may absolutely suspend it: and the subject can never be perfectly understood, wIithout a particular attention to the velocity and direction of' the tides in moderate weather, to serve as a. groundc.work.-* I am, with great respect, Dear Sir, your faithful. humble servant,. J. RENNELL. * Messrs. LAWRIE MId( WH.1TTLa'S pullication, allows the tides in this quarter a velocity of one mile anrd a half per hour, at the springs; half a mile at the neaps. he Britannia's accident happened at dead neaps.
