[239] XXXVI. A View of the Relation between the celebrated.Dr. Halley's Tables, and the Notions of Mr. De Buffon, for establishing a Rule for the probable Duration of the Life of Man; by Mr. William Kersseboom, of the Hague. Translated from the French, by James Parsons, M. D. and F. R. S. eo disconvenit inter Meque et te ~ 1. M Y situation in life not permitting me to look over the works of the learned, was the reason, why I was not one of the first, who perused the General and particular Natural History, etc. of Mr. de Buffon. However a little interval of leisure allowing me to look into it, I am at a stand to find myself mention'd, in the same breath with the celebrated Dr. Halley and others, to receive our condemnation on account of the tables for determining the degrees of probability of the duration of human life: and as this passage is the occasion of my remarks, I will begin by citing it intirely here: `` Man (says M. de Buffon, at the end of the `` second tome) as is well known, dies at all ages; `` and altho' it may be said in general, that his life `` is longer than that of almost any other animal, it `` cannot be denied, that it is at the same time more `` variable and uncertain. Attempts have been of late `` years made to know the degrees of these variations, 5 `` and Read May 31, 1753. [240] `` and to establish, by observations, some certainty `` the parishes of such a city as London, Paris, ~~ the parishes of such a city as London, Paris, ~c. `` the parishes of such a city as London, Paris, ~~ the parishes of such a city as London, Paris, ~~ the parishes of such a city as London, Paris, ~c. `` the parishes of such a city as London, Paris, ~c. `` the parishes of such a city as London, Paris, ~c. `` the parishes of such a city as London, Paris, ~~ the parishes of such a city as London, Paris, ~c`` the parishes of such a city as London, Paris, ~c. `` the parishes of such a city as London, Paris, ~c. `` the parishes of such a city as London, Paris, ~c. `` the parishes of such a city as London, Paris, ~c.`` the parishes of such a city as London, Paris, `` the parishes of such a city as London, Paris,`` the parishes of such a city as London, Paris, ~`` the parishes of such a city as London, Paris, ~c. `` the parishes of such a city as London, Paris, ~`` the parishes of such a city as London, Paris, ~c.`` the parishes of such a city as London, Paris, ~c`` the parishes of such a city as Lo`` the parishes of such a city as London, Par`` the parishes of such a city as London, Paris, ~`` the parishes of such a city as London, Paris,`` the parishes of such a city as London, Paris, ~`` the parishes of such a city as London, Paris, ~c.`` the parishes of such a city as London, Paris, ~c`` the parishes of such a city as London, Paris, ~c`` the parishes of such a city as London, Paris, ~`` the parishes of such a city as London, Paris, ~`` the parishes of such a city as London, Paris, ~c`` the parishes of such a city as London, Paris, ~c. `` should [241] `` should be made use of, where foreigners are daily `` coming in, and natives going out, but also those `` of the country; that, by adding together the re`` sults of each, the one may compensate the other. `` M. Dupre, de St. Maur, of the French Academy, `` has begun this upon twelve country parishes, and `` three of those of Paris: he was willing to commu`` nicate these tables to me to publish them; and I `` the more readily do it, because they are the~ `` only tables, upon which the probabilities of the `` life of mankind in general can be establish'd with `` any certainty.''. As for the tables, I refer for them to the work. ~ 2. I am not at all concern'd for a defence of my table, which is sufficient to support itself; but I am greatly surprised, that a philosopher should condemn works, which he never either saw or read: for it is evident, M. de Buffon never saw my Essays on political Arithmetic; and that all, which he appears to know of it, is indeed very slightly drawn from M. Deparcieux's work, who nevertheless knew no more of it, as he himself makes it appear, than what he found in the Bibliotheque raisonnee for the first three months of the year 1743, Tom. 30. This extract happens unluckily not to be made by an able hand; but, on the contrary, very fit, by its confusion, and the irregularities, which run thro' it, to lead into errors. The corrections, that were made in the second part of the same 30th Tome, are not even sufficient to secure the reader from mistakes. Nevertheless M. de Buffon, without even reading the work, might have known more of it, through H h written [242] written in a language, which he is very likely a stranger to; since Mr. Eames has given an excellent extract of the first essay in English, printed in No 450 of the Transactions of the Royal Society of London, of which this philosopher is a member; and also because Mr. Van Rixtel has inserted an extract of the two succeeding ones in No 468. of the said Transactions. Besides which, M. de la Chapelle has given, in his 13th Tome of the Nouvelle Bibliotheque for the month of December in the year 1742, a very ample and judicious extract of the three essays together. I have also confirm'd my observations by a very interesting and sensible proof, upon that part of London called the city, which is printed in the first three months of the year 1743, Tom. 14. of the Nouvelle Bibliotheque; and likewise in the second three months of the year 1745 of the Bibliotheque raisonnee, is inserted a small piece relative to my observations and proofs. I take the liberty of referring every reader, who may not understand the Low-Dutch language, to those several pieces cited; and my table of the degrees of the probability of the duration of the life of man will support itself very well against the hasty judgment of M. de Buffon, who certainly has too much candour not to acknowledge, after a mature deliberation of those pieces mention d, that they contain something more than `` very distant approaches to the knowledge of the `` mortality of mankind in general.'' ~ 3. I would say much the same of that excellent piece of the learned Dr. Halley, if my surprize did not increase, the more I reflect, that this work ought to be thoroughly known to a member of the Royal Society of London; and that this very member nevertheless makes so careless a judgment upon it. [243] it. This reflection leads me to another kind of defence of that famous deceased author; which is to make M. de Buffon sensible, that `` nearly the same `` degrees of probability of the duration of the life of `` man in general'' are in the table of Dr. Halley, which he would have us think are in the extracts of M. Dupre's observations or tables, which he has published. For this purpose I constructed a table parallel to that of Dr. Halley, which begins with 1000 lives of one year old, and which I found, in the reduction of the great general numbers of Dupre's tables, to have also the smaller numbers analogous; that is, by beginning also with 1000 lives of a year old.

If M. de Buston will compare the table given by himself of the probability of the duration of life, which is founded upon that of M. Dupre de St. Maur, with [247] with that given by M. Deparcieux, in his ingenious work constructed upon that of Dr. Halley, he will find a like conformity between them. It is M. Deparcieux's thirteenth table, which I have before me.

[251] ~ 5. It is therefore sufficiently demonstrated, that Dr. Halley's table ought not, in M. de Buffon's opinion, to be excluded from the class of those, which `` are the only tables, upon which the probabilities `` of the life of mankind in general can be established `` with any certainty;'' far from being comprised, in his severe judgment, among those of authors, `` whose `` researches, however ample, and the result of long `` study, can afford only distant approaches to the `` knowlege of the mortality of mankind in general.'' ~6 M. de Buffon begins his table of the probabilities of life with a term, which precedes that of a year old, called zero d'age; and from M. Dupre's observations, assigns to it a duration of 8 years. I first thought it an error of the press; but there is no room for this doubt, after what M. de Buffon says, `` We `` see by this table (says he) that one may reason`` ably hope, that is, lay an even wager, that an in`` fant just born, or who has no age, will live eight `` years: that an infant, who is a year old, will live `` thirty-three years,'' &c. This little space of eight years struck me; because all the observations, which I know, are very far from it. I had therefore recourse to the source, to the observations of Mr. Dupre himself, and I found it was a mistake of M. de Buffon; the mean life of infants of no age being, according to M. Dupre's tables, twenty-and-five years and upward; and, from the observations of Justel, which Dr. Halley made use of, the mean life of a child of no age is above twenty-and-seven years. ~ 7. I might make an end here, if the subject did not absolutely require my offering a word concerning the nature of both Justel's and M.Dupre's observations. I i 2 The [252] The remark has not escaped the sagacity of Dr. Halley himself: it is, `` that they want the essential; `` which is, the number of living persons, among `` whom the observations upon the dead are made.'' If M. de Buffon had made the same reflections upon M.Dupre's tables, he would have found the irreparable defect of them, as well as Dr. Halley did in Justel's observations; and he would have attended more, without doubt, to the method proposed by Mons. Deparcieux. ~ 8. I shall put an end to this treatise by a word or two, which relates to Dr. Short's displeasure against me. This may perhaps be unnecessary, after the laborious and judicious extract of his book in the Journal Britannique, of the month of July 1750. However since Dr. Short joins with those, who inconsiderately have accused me of partiality to such or such a city, he will have with them my defence (to say no more) in my letter to Mr. Eames, and in the piece already quoted in the Nouvelle Bibliotheque, Tom. XIV. Artic. 8. Let him read, and he will return from his prejudice: if not, Curentur dubii medicis majoribus aegri. Hague, May 11, 1753. Wm. Kersseboom. XXXVII.
