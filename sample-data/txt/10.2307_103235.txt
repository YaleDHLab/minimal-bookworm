II. Part of a Letter from Mr. Ralph Thoresby, F. R. S. to Dr. Hans Sloane, R. S. Secr. concerning some Roman Coins found in Yorkshire. ON Saturday last Mr. Arthington obliged me with the perusal of some Roman Coins, which a few days ago were Plowed up at Cookridge, in some Grounds he purchased of Mr. Kirk Junior, and are a confirmation of the Conjecture of his Ingenious Father (the late Thomas Kirk Esq;) that the Roman Via Vicinalis (which comes from the great Military Road upon BramhamMoor) passed from that Station at Adellocum (of which there is an Account No. 282. of the Philosoph. Transact.) thro' these Grounds to Ilkley. There are but few of them, (not above Twenty that the Servants confess to) but those mostly very fair: The eldest he has is of Domitian, An. Urb. Cond. 846. which you know falls in with the Year of our Lord 95; his Head (135) Head is surrounded with this Inscription, IMPerator CAESar DOMITianus AUGustus GERManicus P. M. (Pontifex Maximus) T R. P. Tribunitia Potestare) XIIII. The Reverse shews he was then saluted Emperor the 22d time, IMP. XXII. COS (Consul.) XVI CENS. PP. (Pater Patriae,) the Flavian Family particularly affected the Title of Censors, and Domitian is the last Emperor who has that Title upon his Medals; the Figure upon this Reverse has a Helmet upon the Head, and a Spear in the Right Hand. The next is of Nerva's, IMP. NERVA. CAES. AUG. PM. TRP. COS. Reverse CONCORDIA EXERCITVVM. Dextrae <inferred>junctae</inferred>. The next Seven are of Trajan's, but all different, IMP. CAES. NERVA. TRAIANVS. GERM. Rev. PM. TRP. COS. III. PP. figura stolata stans, sinistra cornucopiae. The next has the same Inscription, save that it it was in his 4th Consulship, and has figura galeata cum hasta. IMP. TRAIANO. AUG. GER. DAC. PM. TRP. Rev. COS. V. PP. SPQR. (Senatus Populusque Romanus) OPTIMO PRINCipi. Pacis stantis typus, dextra facem admoventis spotiis, ea conflagraturus, sinistra cornucopiae tenentis. (exurge) PAX. IMP. CAES. NER. TRAIANO. OPTIMO. AVG. GER. DACico. Rev. PM. TRP. COS. VI. PP. SPQR. Deus Genius stans, dextra pateram. IMP. TRAIANVS. AVG. GER. DAC. PM. TRP. Rev. COS. VI. SPQR. OPTIMO.PRINC. fig. stolata. IMP. (136) IMP. TRAIANO. OPTIMO. AVG. GER. DAC. PM. TR. P. P. Rev. COS. VI. PP. SPQR. figura stolata dextra Caduceum, sinistra cornucopiae. IMP. TRAIANO. AVG. GER. DAC. PM. TRP COS. VI. PP. Rev. SPQR. OPTIMO. PRINCIPI. Columna cochlidis Trajani. The rest that are legible, are of Hadrian's, viz. HADRIANVS. AVGVSTVS. Rev. COS. III. Victoria cum Palma. The other has upon the Reverse, FELICITATI. AVGVSTI. Above the Navis Praetoria, and below it COS. III. PP. These are all of Silver: There was a large one of Copper of the Emperor Domitian, IMP. CAES. DOMIT. AVG. GERM..... but the Reverse was not legible. John Dyneley of Bramhope Esq; has also three, one with FIDES EXERCITVVM, one of Titus's, and one of Trajan's with Dacia Captive under a Trophy, but I want the Inscriptions; all the rest are in the Possession of the Ingenious Cyril Arthington of Arthington Esq; the Lord of the Mannor, who obliged me with one, for Lecturing upon the rest, the Figure whereof I send you, it being upon a remarkable Occasion, and not mentioned in Occo (at least in my Edition of that Author;) 'tis inscribed HADRIANVS AVG. COS. III. PP. Rev. RESTITVTORI HISPANIAE. This was upon his peaceable setling of Affairs in that his Native Country; Spain is represented here as a Woman with a Branch in her right (137) right Hand to denote her Fruitfulness, kneeling before the Emperor, who kindly takes her by the Hand to raise her up. ~ ~ By these it appears, that this Station ~ when the Roman Empire was in its prime; and there being none of a later Date, makes it probable, that it perished in some of the Insurrections of the Native Brigantes, about Severus's Time, as it was conjectured from the form of the Letter A in the Inscriptions upon the Fune<inferred>ual</inferred> Monuments formerly accounted for.
