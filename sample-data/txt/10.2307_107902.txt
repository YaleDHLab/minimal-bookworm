[ 209 ] XV.-On the theoretical investigation of the velocity of sound, as corrected from M. DULONG'S recent experiments, compared with the results of the obser.. vations of Dr. MOLL and Dr. VAN BEEK. By Dr. SIMONS, Assistant at the Observatory of the University of Utrecht. Communicated by Captain HENRY KATER, Vice-President. Read March 18, 1830. IT has been demonstrated by the ever-to-be-lamented LAPLACE *, that in order to obtain the velocity of sound by calculation, Sir IsAAc NEWTON'S original expressiont, V\/D must be multiplied by the square root of the ratio between the specific heats of atmospheric air under a constant pressure and under a constant volume. In this formula V is the velocity of sound, g the intensity of gravitating force, p the atmospheric pressure, and D the density of the medium through which sound is transmitted; the density of mercury being equal to I. The coefficient, which is to multiply the Newtonian formula, has been deduced by M. LAPLACE, first from MM. LAROCHE and BERARDO'S experiments, next from those of MM. CLEMENT and DESORMES ?, and finally from the more accurate investigations of MM. GAY-LussAc and WELTER. By introducing this correction, the velocity as deduced from calculation, was found to differ but little from what is actually obtained by experiment. But this difference between calculation and experiment, however small, was always such, that the observed velocity constantly exceeded that which was deduced by calculation.* Annales des Physique et de Chimie, t. iii. p. 238. t.

SIMONS ON THE COEFFICIENT OF THE FORMULA The degree of accuracy with which experiments on the velocity of sound are now conducted, naturally led to a supposition that some of the elements of the theoretical formula were susceptible of a greater degree of correctness; and thus natural philosophers were rather inclined to attribute the difference between experiment and calculation to some deficiency of the analytical -expression, than to error in the observation. It has been shown in a recent volume of the Philosophical rrransactions, that the experiments on the velocity of sound, made by Captain PARRY in the polar regions, lead to the same conclusions with those made by Drs. MOLL and VAN BEEK, under widely different circumstances and this coincidence would tend to confirm our doubts as to the correctness of some of the elements of the computation. A very able experimentalist, M. DULONG, lately published some experiments on the specific heat of the gases*, in the investigation of which he recurs to LAPLACE S analytical formula. M. DULONG's reasoning is nearly this: If it be admitted that the velocity of sound in atmospheric air is obtained by multiplying the Newtonian formula by the square root of the ratio between the two specific heats of the air, under a constant pressure, and under a constant volume, it must follow, that this ratio, or the coefficient with whose square root the original formula must be multiplied, may also be deduced from the velocity of sound as given by observation. Accordingly, M. DULONG computed this ratio or coefficient from actual observations on the velocity of sound, by the formula K V2 K D in which K is the ratio between the specific heat of air under a constant pressure, and the specific heat of air under a constant volume, whilst V is the velocity of sound as obtained by experiment. The object of this paper is to compare the inquiries of M. DULONG with the experiments on the velocity of sound made by Drs. MOLL and VAN BEEK, which were published in the Philosophical Transactions. The -following Table contains only such of the observations of Drs. MOLL and VAN BEEK, in which the guns were fired on both stations exactly at the same* Annales de Physique et de Chinie, t. xli. p. 113.

From this Table and the following data, the results obtained by M. DULONG were compared with Drs. MOLL and VAN BEEK's experiments. The weight of a cube centimetre of mercury at the temperature of 00 Centigrade, is 13.596152 grammes. This is according to the experiments of MM. BiOT and -ARAGO, and MM. DULONG and PETIT'eS subsequent investigations. The weight of a cube centimetre of drv' atmospheric air, at zero of Centigrade scale, and under the barometric pressure of Om.760 is, according to the same observers 0.001299541 grammes*,J BIOT, Traite de Physiq.

This formula shows that V is independent of the latitude; and thus that the velocity of sound is not directly affected by the geographical position, of the place of observation. From the late M.

From the more recent investigations of M. DULONG, we have K = 1.42-1. Thus, taking K from MM.

DULONG'S value of K agrees 214 DR. SIMONS ON THE VELOCITY OF SOUND. with the result of experiment. Employing MM. GAY-LuSSAC's and WELTER'S co-efficient, the differences between the observed and calculated velocity are constantly affected with the same sign; whereas in taking K from M. DULONG, the differences are sometimes positive and sometimes negative. It is therefore presumed that M. DULONG'S labours bring the calculation of the velocity of sound much nearer to the truth than before, and that such differences as are yet remaining between calculation and experiment, may be attributed, with great probability, to errors unavoidable in such complicated observations.
