F R SO Read 3une 20 t79S. Mr. BARKER S RegiSter, Sc. 2 2 1 THE winter was a severe one ; there was a sharp frost every month from December to Marchn chiefly between the full and the new moons, and the intervals were often stormy and wet; bllt t-hose in February, both at the middle and latter end of the month, were milder, and less w-et. 'the beginning of March continued mild, with frequent thollgh $mall rains theri followed as sharp a frest, for a week, as any in the svinter. After that s-tormy weather into April, but warm and growirlg9 till a violent thunder storm toward Stamforcl tile th, and two days continued rain here, a-nd i< nost other places about the 18thn renewed the wet season, which lasted all summer, and was perhaps wetter in many places tllan here, for we 11a(1 no iheavy thunder storms all the sunlmer, as they had in some parts. Whenever there was thander this year, it was almost always cold after itn and often cold weather without it very little sunshine and marly sharp frosty uornings both in May and June, which cut off the apples after they appeared to be set. The greatest rains this sulnmer were after the middle of April; before the middle of Mayv about the 8th of June: the 2ts-t of July v the r8th of August; and 14uth of September: those in April, June, and July, made floods, the two latter of which did great damage to the mea dow hay v andl there vere frequent sometimes almost dailyS lesser rains. The intervals of fair and fine weather svere shortn an not many, and tho$e not always warm n the beginning of May, and about the 2lSt; the beginning and end of Julne; the beginnin-g of July; alld, what was the firiest tilue this summers the first half of August. During thisS in general so very svet a season, the hay arld harvest were got in, and, where they were not floodedn I think with less damage than rnight have MDCCXCIII. g G Mrw BARKER)S Register, Scsbeen expec<ed. The latter llay was got up during the fine time in August, some of the harvest in a tolerable time tlle beginlling of September v arld what was delayed by the al most dity lsains for twothirds of September, was finished in a fine time the beginning of October, tlle crop of wheat was tolelrable wellS but barleyf oats, and peas, were dear. this year was the wettest since 178g, which, with 1*774g and some othersn exceeded it, and this, like those two yearsj, began to grow less svet the beginning of October. Yet the frequent rains aft;er that, though less in quantity, kept the grourld from drying, which was already too wet, and the roads continued uncommoxlly torn up all winter, and Decemberf keing wetter, increased it. The last six weeks of the year were in general dark and cloudy, or misty, very little sunn arld not much frost, and so far seems to promise an open winter7 but December was a stormy time; several great ones, and some great rains and flOodse I1lches.

It might seel:n the wetterf because the autumn of 1791 was wet, so that there was a long continuance of it, and perhaps there might be more rain in some other places than here, as we had no great thun-der storms all the summer at this place, which they had in several parts, some not many miles off.\ T>he wettest year«No. VIII. Abstract. IfiIr. BARKER9S Registera Sc.227here were about *774 and 178e, whicll I have therefore compared with last year, in-No. Ie where I have set down the whole rain, atld cast up tlle sum from January the firstn to the end of every 3rnonth, in each year: and it appears, that to the end of January, to the end of February, and of March, the wettest vvas 1774, the nex-t 1y8e and 1y92 was less wet than either of them. 'the very wet April and WIay in 1782 altered the order of thein; antl to the end of Apriln of M[ay? of June of July, and of August7 the wettest wTas 1782 1 the laext 17y4; and the last 1792. Septem1ser, y7q that wettest of all mollths in fifty-seven years, altered the order again to <774, 1782 1792; and it continued so to the end of the Jrear. In No.. IIv I have given some of the greatest twelve months, whether beginnirg with January or not 7 and the greatest 3645 days is froln ()ctober z77g to October 2, 1774, which is 39,724 inches; and all that I have here given exceed 1792. In No. III. is the greatest three years, from May 9, 1773 to May 8, 1776, which is lOln4g5$ inchesX and the greatest seventeen monthsa from May gn 1773 to October 8, 1774,3 is S6,277 inches. In No. IV. are the greatest nine montlls7 January 6 to Octobsr 6, 1774, go727 inches X and several others, to 1792S 2+, z62 inches. In No. V. are several of the greatest six molathsX from *774, 24,go4 inches, to 1792) 20,257 inches. In No. VI are several of tlle greatest three months, fror3: 14S,477 inches in r774, to xo,9g8 inches in 1792. The greatest month last year was, from August z6 to September ,g, 5S1o8 inches, but I have had thirteen greater; the most of all was in y74,, 8v270 inches; the rest are set down in order in No.VII*; and the last is that in 1t,92. Lastly in No. VIII. I have set down together the wettest times in all the several cases. 528 Mr. BARKER'S Regzster, Sc. At Selbourn, betw:een Alton and PetersfieldS in Hampshire, which lies at the NE foot of a steep hill, that rises atl hundred yards perpendicular above it, they have half as much more rain as I have; there was +82 inches last year9 as it is set down in the first page; but they had o4 inches in 1782, which is-something more. But I was surprised to see, in the Supplem-ent to the Gentleman's Magazine, page tlgy, that Mr. GOUGH says there was 8S2 inches of rain at Kendal last year. This is an astonishirlg quan-tity; though i-t is a-hilly country, it is alinost four tilnes my common trea-r, and above double the greatestv and I should have thought it enough, in latitude 54O, to have made the vvhole country a marshe
