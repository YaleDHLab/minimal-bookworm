An Account of the Eclipse of the Moon, which happened Nov. 21, 1751; observed by Mr. James Short, F. R. S. in Surry-street. THE weather was exceedingly tempestuous, and the sky pretty much overcast with clouds, so that the following times cannot be depended upon to less than 2 minutes. Read Dec. 19, 1751. ~ ~ ~ Penumbra very visible at.. 7 58 0 Beginning of the eclipse at.. 8 6 0 End of the eclipse at... 11 6 0 The quantity of this eclipse seemed about the middle to be larger than according to all the tables; but its quantity, tho' the air was then exceedingly clear, could not be measured in the micrometer, because of the high wind; nor could the moon's diameter be measured, for the same reason. Transit [318] Transit of the moon over the meridian. ~ ~ ~ Preceding limb passed the meridian at 12 5 18 Subsequent limb passed the meridian at 12 7 50 The sky was at this time exceedingly clear. Mr. Pound observed a similar eclipse at Wanstead, just two Sarotic periods before this, and has described it in the Philos. Trans. N. 347, p. 402. and makes the following remark, `` This eclipse is `` the more considerable, as happening very near `` the moon's perigee, and therefore useful to verify `` her anomaly; as also to limit the greatest diameter `` of the shadow of the earth, and consequently the `` parallax of the moon. This may be very properly `` compared with that of the 19th of October 1697, `` whose middle was at 7~ 41~ p. m. at London, and `` the quantity the same as now.'' Here follows a computation made from Dr. Halley's tables by Mr. John Catlyn of Guy's Hospital. h ~ ~ Beginning at... 8 18 44 Middle at.... 9 41 55 End at.... 11 5 6 But if an allowance is made for the errors in the moon's motion, when she was in similar circumstances in the month of November 1733, the above times of this eclipse may be marked with the following numbers. ~ ~ ~ Beginning at.... 8 14 0 Middle at.... 9 37 30 End at.... 11 0 30 I must [319] I must add to Mr. Pound's remark above, that this eclipse happened nearer to the moon's perigee than that, which he observed in the year 1715, and therefore more proper for verifying the moon's anomaly, and limiting the greatest diameter of the shadow of the earth.
