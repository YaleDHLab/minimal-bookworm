[507] I. Part of a Letter from Mr James Cuningham to the Publisher, from the Cape of Good Hope, Ap. 6. 1700. giving anaccount of his observations on the Thermometer and Magnetick Needle in his Voyage thither. I Have not time now to give you a particular account of the Thermometer, with the variation and inclination of the Needle, only in general, that the greatest height the Spirit did arise to in the Thermometer, was two divisions below extream hot, when we were near the AEquinoctial; and that two degrees to the Northward of the Line, the North point of the Needle did incline 8 degrees downward, but as we went to the Southward it was inclined above 48 degrees upward.
