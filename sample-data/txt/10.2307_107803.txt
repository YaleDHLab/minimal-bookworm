77 2 VIII. Account of a series of observations, made in the summer of the year 1825, for the purpose qf determining the difference of meridians of the Royal Observatories of Greenwich and Paris; drawn up by J. F. W. HERSCHEL, Esq. M. A. Sec. R. S. Communicated by the Board of Longitude. Read January 12, 1826. OPERATIONS having been carried on to a considerable extent in France, and other countries on the continent, for the purpose of ascertaining differences of longitude by means of signals, simultaneously observed at different points along a chain of stations; and the Royal Observatory at Paris, in particular, having been connected in this manner with a number of the most important stations, it was considered desirable by the French government that the Royal Observatory at Greenwich should be included in the general design. The British Board of Longitude was accordingly invited to lend its co-operation towards carrying into effect a plan for that purpose ; and the invitation being readily accepted on their part, I was deputed, in conjunction with Capt. SABINE, in the course of the last summer, to direct the practical details of the operation on the British side of the channel, and to make the necessary observations. Every facility was afforded us in making our dispositions, on the part of the different branches of His Majesty's government to which it was found necessary to apply. A detachment of artillery was placed, by his Grace the Duke Of WELLINGTON, Master 78 Mr. HERSCHEL'S account of a series of observations General of the Ordnance, under the orders of Capt. SABINE. Horses, waggons, and men, were furnished for the conveyance of a tent, telescopes, rockets, and other apparatus; and four of the chronometers belonging to the Board of Admiralty were placed at our disposal. The rockets required for making the signals were furnished us from France. It would have been easy, doubtless, to have procured them from the Royal Arsenal at Woolwich; but on the representation of Colonel BONNE, to whom the principal direction of the operations in France was intrusted, it was thought more advisable to accept an offer made to us of any number which might be required, prepared at Paris expressly for similar operations, carrying a charge of 8 ounces of powder, the instantaneous explosion of which, at their greatest altitude, was to constitute the signals to be observed. Our previous arrangements being made, on the 7th of July I left London; and after visiting the station pitched upon at Wrotham, which was the same with that selected by Capt. KATER and Major COLBY, as a principal point in their triangulation in 1822; and finding it possessed of every requisite qualification for the purpose of making the signals, from its commanding situation, being unquestionably the highest ground between Greenwich and the coast, proceeded to Fairlight Down, near Hastings, where I caused the very convenient observatory tent, belonging to the Board of Longitude, to be pitched immediately over the centre of the station of 1821, which was readily found from the effectual methods adopted by the gentlemen who conducted the trigonometrical operations in that year, for securing this valuable point. Here, on the 8th, I was joined by Capt. for determining the d~ference of meridians, &c. 79 SABINE, who, it had been arranged, should proceed to the first observing station on the French side of the Channel, there to observe, in conjunction with Colonel BONNE, the signals made on the French coast, and those made at the station of Mont Javoult ; which latter were to be observed immediately from the observatory at Paris; while, on the other hand, it was agreed that M. le Lieutenant LARGETEAU, of the French corps of geographical engineers, should attend at Fairlibht, on the part of the French commission, and observe, conjointly with myself, the signals made at La Canche, the post on the opposite coast (elevated about 60o feet above the sea, being nearly the level of Fairlight Down) and also those to be fired from Wrotham Hill, which were expected to be immediately visible from a scaffold, raised for the purpose on the roof of the Royal Observatory of Greenwich. By this arrangement, and by immediate subsequent communication of the observations made at each station, it was considered that the advantage of two independent lines of connexion, a British and a French would be secured between the two extreme stations; i. e. the two national observatories; every possibility of future misunderstanding obviated, and all inconvenience on either side, arising from delay, or miscarriage in the transmission of observations, be avoided. With the assistance of Capt. SABINE, and by the help of exact information as to the azimuths of Wrothami and other nearer stations in the triangulation of i 821, with which Capt. KATER had obligingly furnished us, and of which Fairlight Church proved the most convenient, being close at hand and favorably situated and easily visible in the twilight; and 8o Mr. HERSCHEL'S account of a series of observations from the previously calculated azimuth of La Canche ( 140 30' E.); four night glasses by DOLLOND, provided at the order of the Board of Longitude expressly for this operation, and which I had caused to be fixed on posts firmly driven into the ground beneath the tent, were then pointed, two on the station of La Canche, and two on that of Wrotham Hill. Those directed to the. former were of four inches clear aperture, the others of three. In case of any difficulty arising as to the pointing, I had taken care to provide myself with an excellent eight-inch repeating theodolite, on the REICHENBACH construction, by SCHENCK, of Berne; but it was found unnecessary to use it, as the night glasses were purposely constructed with an azimuthal motion, and a rough graduation read off by an adjustable vernier, so as to allow their being set at once a few minutes before the observations conmenced, by taking Fairlight steeple as a zero point; a circumstance which proved exceedingly convenient, as it allowed of their being dismounted after each night's observations, and removed to a place of security ; and thus rendering it unnecessary to harass our small party by keeping guard in our absence. On the night of the 8th I had directed blue lights to be fired at Wrotham, as a trial of the visibility of the stations, or rather as a verification of the pointing of the telescopes; for on the former point there could be no doubt, the station at Wrotham being situated precisely on the edge of the escarpment of the chalk which borders the Weald of Kent, and having been actually connected with Fairlight by direct observation, while no obstacle but a low copse wood, over which it might fairly be presumed that no rocket would for determining the deff'rence of meridians, &c. 81 flail to rise, separated it from a direct view of Greenwich, at about 20 miles distance. Either from haze in the atmosphere, or from the too great distance, nothing was seen that night or the next; which however caused no uneasiness, as we could depend on our. instruments and information. The next morning Capt. SABINE quitted Hastings, and joined Col. BONNE, at his post, on the morning of the ioth, the day appointed for the commencement of the observations; meanwhile I was joined by M. LARGETEAU, who remained with me the whole time of their continuance, performing every part of a mnost scrupulous and exact observer, as the observations herewith communicated will abundantly testify. The observations were continued during 12 nights, to signals being made at each rocket station every night. The weather throughout the whole of this time was magnificent, and such as is not very likely to occur again for some years; a circumstance of the last importance in operations of this nature, where lights are to be seen across'nearly 5o miles of sea, and also by reason of the verification of the sidereal times at the observatories by transits. One night only a local fog deprived us of the sight of i,5 out of the 20 signals; but on the whole, out of 120 made at Wrotham, no less than 112 were seen from Fairlight (about 40 miles) and 89 from Greenwich; while out of the same number made at La Canche, 93 were observed at the former post. I am sorry to add, however, that owing to a combination of untoward circumstances, which no foresight or exertion on the part of Capt. SABINE or myself could possibly have led us to calculate on, or enabled us to prevent, and which the most zealous endeavours on that of Col. BONNE failed to remedy, no MDCCCXXVI. M 89 Mr. HERSCHEL'S account of a series of observations less than eight out of the twelve nights' observations were totally lost, as to any result they might have afforded, and the remainder materially crippled; so that a much more moderate estimate of the value of our final result must be formed, than would otherwise have been justified. Still it is satisfactory to be able to add, (such is the excellence of the method) that a result on which considerable. reliance can be placed, may be derived from the assemblage of the observations of these four nights; and when it is stated that this result appears not very likely to be a tenth of a second in error, and extremely unlikely to prove erroneous to twice that amount, it will perhaps be allowed that, under such ci'rcumstances, more could hardly be expected. for determining the diference of meridians, &c.

Observations made at the top of the Royal Observatory, Greenwich, on the rockets at -Wrotham. July 11, 1825. The blue light and all the rockets were this evening distinctly seen by the naked eye. The observations were made with telescopes, by three observers, with the same chronometer. The chronometer was compared with the transit clock both before and after observation. The blue light appeared about 9h 21 m 25g. Rockets. Appt Time I. II. III.

PREVIOUS to stating the result of these observations, it will not be irrelevant to explain the method pursued in reducing them, and the principles on which the calculation has been made; and it may be here remarked, that the brevity and facility of the computations which will appear to be required for this purpose, is not the least recommendation of the method itself. Suppose A and Z to be the two extreme points whose difference of longitudes is to be determined, and at each of which the true sidereal time is supposed to be known by transits of well determined stars and registered by exact clocks, or carefully compared chronometers. Intermediate between these, suppose two, or any number of stations, B, C, &c. chosen, at each of which are placed observers furnished with telescopes and good chronometers; and again, intermediate between these, and in the order A, a, B. b, C, c, Z. let posts or stations a, b, c, be selected, at which signals are made, by the explosion of gunpowder, the discharge of rockets, the extinction of lamps, or otherwise, at regular concerted times, and so arranged that the signals at a shall be visible from both A and B ; those at b from both B and C; and those at c from B and Z. Now let a signal be made at a, and observed both from A and B. and the moment of its happening noted at A by the sidereal clock, and at B by the MDCCCXXVI. P io6 Mr. HERSCHEL'S account of a series of observations chronometer,; then, if the observations were perfect, the difference of the clock at A, and the chronometer at B, would become exactly known. Let this be denoted by A -B. A short time after, -let a signal be made at b, and observed by the chronometers at B and C, whose difference (which we will in like manner denote by B C,) becomes thus precisely known at the time of making the signal. In the same manner may the difference C -Z of the chronometer at C and the sidereal clock at Z be known at the moment of explosion of a signal at c; and so on, if there be more intermediate stations. Now, the clocks at A and Z being all along supposed to keep strict sidereal time, if the watches at B, C, did the same, it is manifest that the difference between any two of them determined at one moment would be the same at every other; and therefore the intervals elapsed between the signals would be out of the question, and the observations might all be regarded as simultaneous; so that the sum of the differences (A B) + (B-C) + (C Z) =A Z would express strictly the difference of the true sidereal times at the extreme points, i. e. their difference of longitudes expressed in time, without any further calculation or reduction. It is equally evident that, whatever be the rates of the watches, if the intervals elapsed between the signals were infinitely small, so as to reduce their gain or loss in these times to nothing, the same would hold good. Since this however cannot be the case, it is obvious that the difference of longitudes so obtained will be affected by the rates of the watches and the intervals of the signals, which must accordfor.determining the d4ference -of meridians, &c. 107 ingly be allowed for. Now, as the intervals at which the signals are made at the successive stations are small (only, five minutes), the gain or loss of the watches used may be calculated for such small times to great nicety; and, if the watches were regulated to sidereal time, and of any ordinary degree of goodness, the correction on this accountwould be almost insensible; or, if regulated, as is generally the case, to mean time, the reduction from mean to sidereal time only need be applied, neglecting the deviation of the rates from strict mean time. The calculation then becomes of extreme simplicity ; for since the watches have equal rates, we have no occasion to apply any correction to their observed dif. ferences; and it will suffice to apply to the uncorrected value of A (=A-Z, or) * A _ ( A xB) + (B'-C') / ( C'Zl/) the mere reduction from mean to sidereal time for the interval elapsed between the first and last signal; or in other words (regarding the whole operation as a species of telegraphing), for the time the message has occupied in its transmission from one observatory to the other.* For example. On the igth, a signal was made at Mont Javoult, and noted at Paris to have happened at 18h s9m 2. true sidereal time at Paris, and at Lignieres at IlC 49m 41s.Q by the Lignieres Chronometer. About Em after this, a signal made at La Canche was observed at Lignieres to happen at le 54m 5%, and at Fairlight at 10h 46m 378,5 by the Fair. light-chronometer. Finally, a third signal was made about 5m later still at Wrotharm, and observed at 1 h film .59S.4 by * Might not telegraphs -be employed to ascertain the difference of longitudes of the stations -between which they are established ? io8 Mr. HERSCHEL'S account of a series of observations the Fairlight chronometer, and at 18h 41m 79. 1 true sidereal time at Greelnwich.

Such is the result of the transmission of a single signal along the line, and such the whole calculation required to deduce it. It is chosen at random from 'among the observations, yet is probably entitled to at least as much confidence as any value hitherto previously obtained; a circumstance which sets the excellence of this method in a very strong light. Such would be the process of calculation in the simplest state of the data, viz. when the signals are seen along the whole line without a failure, so that each message so transmitted arrives at its destination and gives a complete result. Buit this (in the present instance at least) has not been always, or"generally the case. It has much more commonly happened that a signal made at one station (a for instance, has not been simultaneously observed, or not observed at all, at A and at B, while the other signals, at b, c, &c. have been regularly seen and registered. In every such case (of which endless -combinations may occur) a link of the chain fails, and no result can be obtained from this series of observations taken singly. A very slight consideration will suffice to show that were we for determining the dyfference of meridians, &c. g09 to reject all such broken series, the observations of a whole night might easily be thrown away, though capable of affording a result quite as good as any other. Such a case actually occurs in the observations of the 18th, where no complete transmission of any one signal from end to end of the line took place, yet the mean result of that night's observations deviates less than two-tenths of a second from the result finally adopted as the truth. The most advantageous way of employing such a broken series of observations as we have described is not at once obvious. It may depend on circumstances too nice for calculation and which can be felt only by the observers themselves. The fairest however, and that which by employing all the observations according to one uniform rule leaves nothing to partiality, seems to me to be the following. Let A be the time marked by the sidereal clock at the first extreme station A, then calling E the time marked by the same clock at any assumed arbitrary epoch, AGE will denote the sidereal time elapsed since that epoch. Call i8 the rate or sidereal time of the chronometer at the 2d station (B), X being supposed negative when the chronometer loses, (as for instance when it shows mean time). At the same moment that the clock at A marks A, let this chronometer mark B, then, since , (AE) is the quantity it has gained, since the epochs, B A (A E) must be the time it would have india cated, if instead of gaining or losing, it had kept true sidereal time since the epoch. Consequently (the clock being sup, posed to have no rate')A-{ B _3(A-E) }orA-B+ P(A-E) wtill be the difference of the clock and chronometer reduwed 110 Mr. HERSCHEL'S account of a series of observations to this epoch, i. e. the difference they would have indicated if instead of comparing them at the time A, they had been compared at the time E. Every signal simultaneously observed at A and B, gives a direct comparison of the clock and chronometer; but it is only when thus reduced to a fixed epoch that these comparisons become comparable inter se; but when so reduced their mean may be taken, and is of course preferable to the result of any single comparison. Hence if we put P-mean of all the (A -B) + A x mean of all the (A E) P will express the difference of the clock and chronometer at the epoch more probably than any of the individual values derived from single observations. It follows therefore that at any other sidereal time A', the time indicated by the chronometer at B, (or B') may be calculated from the expression B'==(A'-P) + (3 (A'-E) (a) more probably than it can be derived from any single actual observation. This equation gives Al B'+ P+j E = B' + P 0 (P + B-E) I+I neglecting squares and higher powers of A, whence the time by the clock at A becomes known at any instant in terms of that shown by the watch at B. Now let a signal be made between B and C, and noted to happen at the moment marked B' by the watch at B, and C' by that at C. Let (3 and y denote their respective rates on sidereal time ; then since B'A (A'-E) and C'-7 (A'-E) are the times they would have marked had they kept strict for determinzng the difference of meridians, &c. 111 sidereal time since the epoch, their difference reduced to the fixed epoch will be (BI_ C') |( ,y ) (At-E) in which, substituting for A its value above found, we get ,(Bf C()-(k3-->) (P +B BE) neglecting powers and products of P and y. Putting then Q-mean of all the(B'C')-(3-Ty)-meanof all the (P+B'-E) we get the most probable value of the difference of the chronometers at the epoch which can be obtained from any number of such comparisons. Finally, if we make a comparison at any time A" (Paris Sid. T.) between the watch at C and the clock at z, and call their indications at that moment C' and Z", their apparent difference will be C"Z", and their difference reduced to the epoch will be (C"/_ Zf) _ (A"E). But Q being the most probable difference between the chronometers B and C at the epoch, and (I y) the difference of their rates Q + (o-by) (A"E) will be their difference at any other moment A"; hence B"C"= Q + (3 -y) (A"E). But by the equation (a) since B" and A" are corresponding times, we have Bl A/'W-+P * ( (A"--E). Consequently substituting this for B" we get C"A"-P--Q+v (A"-E) whence A"P + Q + C"-( A"-E) P + Q + C" (P + Q + C"E) neglecting the square and higher powers of v: 112 Mr. HERSCHEL'S account of a series of observations Consequently, still neglecting the same things we get C"-Z"-ry fP+ Q +C".E} for the difference of the timekeepers C and Z reduced to the epoch, and putting R= mean of all the (C" Z"/) -y mean of all the (P+Q+C"E) R will be their most probable difference reduced to the fixed epoch. P, Q, and R, being thus obtained, we must obviously have for the correct difference of longitudes, AP + Q + R. Now, substituting for P, Q, R, their values, this gives A = mean of (A-B) + mean of ( B'C') + mean of (C@Z") +,.mean of (A E) + (r ,i).mean of (P + B'-E) Y.mean of (P + Q + C"-E) that is, reducing, A = mean of (A-B)4 + mean of (B'-C') + mean of (C"-Z") + ,3. mean of A + (vy i3)mean of B'-v.mean of C" HM-0P ThQv This value of A is however susceptible of still further reduction by substituting for P and Q their values; which if done, and the powers and products of ,2 and v neglected, as has all along been done, we get A = mean of (A B) + mean of (B'_ C') + mean of (C"-Z") 4-g.mean of A + (ry~-aI3) mean of B'y. mean of C" 3. mean of (A B) -av. mean of (B'C') that is, finally (since the numbers of the observations of A and of B are necessarily equal, and therefore the mean of the values of AB is equal to the mean of A the mean for determining the dfference of meridians, &c. 11 3 of1 B, and -so for the rest) reducing and striking out all the terms which destroy each other.

A _AAB + B'C + C'I-z', + n (B,B') + -y (C C!( This expression is, as it obviously ought to be, independent of the arbitrary epoch E, which may be assumed any number of hours or days before or after the observations. The first line of this value of A may be regarded as an approximate one; the second as a correction depending on the rates of the watches; and it is clear that the several portions of which this correction consists are the respective gains of the chronometers on Sid. T. during the mean amounts of the delay of the message between the several stations, taking the expression in its algebraical sense, where a negative delay corresponds to an anticipation. If all the signals succeeded, the coefficients of 3 and v would be each oh 5, and the amount of the correction would -be ( d + 7 ) * 254h-$ 8m8 *It would therefore require no less a deviation of one of the chronometers from its assumed rate than 29se, per diem, or of both of them 14. , and the same way, to produce an uncertainty in the result to the amount of a tenth of a second; deviations incompatible with the MDCCCXXVI. Q 114 Mr. HERSCHEL'S account of a series of observations character of ordinary good watches, not to speak of chronometers. The worst case that can happen is where the first szgnal only at a gives corresponding observations at the stations adjacent, the last only at b, the first again only at c, and so on. In this case the coefficients of , and .y would each equal the whole interval between the first and last signal at each post, or (in the present case) 1h som, The correction here would be l2X 24 = 6 In this extreme case, the sum of the deviations of both watches from their assumed rates, need only amount to 18.6 to produce an uncertainty of a tenth of a second in the result; and though such a case as here supposed is in the last degree improbable, yet as a certain approach to it is not unlikely, it may be of use to show how the rates of the watches, if not otherwise known, may be obtained, or if known, verified, by the observations themselves. If we consider the observations on two successive nights, at two of the extreme stations, A and B for instance, calling A and B the means of the simultaneous observations on the first night, and A, B, on the second, we have, assuming for an epoch some time E = any number of days before either of the night's observations, PA-B + i3(A-E) But since this is generally true, if the observations be made in sufficient number on both nights to destroy their indivji dual errors in the mean result, we must also have P Aai w w,+ ge (AOE) equating which we get, for determining the dfJerence of meridians, &c. 116 A-B(A-E-) --Al-B.-(Al E) whence we find (A,-B) (A B) Af-A In this formula it is to be observed that A, and 13, are each greater than At hours ; but as timekeepers only register excesses above i2 hours and its multiples, if we wish to denote by A, and B, the mere readings off of the tinmed keepers, we must put 24h + A, and 24h + B, for A, and B, if the interval be one day; 48h + A, and 48h + B, if two days, and so on, so that (n being the number of days elapsed) we get (A,-B,)-(A-B) In like manner may the rate y of the chronometer at C be found by comparison with the clock at Z thus, (z -c,/) / c X 2411+ Z;'Z" If there be intermediate chronometers, the rate of each on that immediately preceding or following it may be found in exactly the same way.

The rates originally assigned to the chronometers on leaving Paris and London, were respectively (on mean time), Motel No. 39, + 15.8. Baker 74,4, + V.20. The former, then, in the interval must have altered its rate (if that deduced from the observations of the 18th and 1i9th be correct), no less than 7St63 ; and between the 18th and 2ist, must have again accelerated its daily rate by 8.31 , fluctuations not to be supposed in a chronometer of any character. It is therefore probable that the rate 51s83 of the i8th-19th is incorrect, and the observations being positive, and liable to no errors capable of accounting for so large a deviation, the cause, on this supposition, can lie nowhere but in some accidental derangement in that interval. Now it unfortunately happens, that the interval B -B', on the i8th, to which this suspicious rate is to be applied, is nlo less than 41m 20o56, which produces a correction of 0s1 7, or nearly two-tenths of a second in the result of that night's obser-. vations. If we examine the individual observations of both nights on which this rate depends, we shall find no satisfaction, though they tend to confirm the suspicion of a derangement 118 Mr. HERSCHEL'S account of a series of observations in the intervening day, by indicating rather a gain, than a loss on mean time ;-but the unavoidable errors of observation will not permit the deduction of a rate from such short intervals as those elapsed during the observations of a single night. However, we may be relieved from the disagreeable necessity of rejecting the night's observations on this score, by reflecting, that all observations are liable to some errors; that if we reject this on account of a suspected error of two tenths of a second, arising from the fault of a chronometer, we certainly should not be warrantable in retaining the result of the observations of the 2ist, where the whole night's work rests on a single signal, and on the transit of a single star observed at Greenwich, and where an error to the extent of nearly half a second, from both causes united, may very fairly be presumed. We may be relieved, I say, from the necessity of rejecting observations where there are assuredly none to spare, by remarking that, according to any fair estimation of the weight of each night's result from the number of observations, the most suspicious result, that of the 2ist, is precisely that which holds the lowest rank-and that whether we retain or reject those of the two nights in question, the ultimate result will (as will hereafter appear), be unaffected to the extent of more than three-hundredths of a second. for determining the diference of meridians, & c.. 9 .Actual Calculation and Results.

If corresponding observations at any station be wanting, the weight iIs evidently nothing; so that calling x, y, z, the numbers of corresponding observations at A and B, at B and C, and at C and Z respectively, x x y x z must necessarily be a multiplier of the function expressing the joint weight of the whole. But if the number of observations at any one station, or at all, be infinitely multiplied, the weight is clearly not infinite. If at all the stations, it would afford only such a degree of evidence as a perfect comparison of the clocks would give, which isbut a relative certainty, after all, and -may be -denoted by unity. In like manner, if the observations at any one pair of stations be infinitely multiplied, the result is still open to all the errors of imperfect observations at the rest, so that unity will {in like manner be the maximum of the coefficient depending on any separate set. The function X 3/Z X-+ I Y + X Z + I is the simplest which satisfies these conditions, each factor vanishing when its variable is o, and becoming unity when infinite. The same reasoning applies to the transit observations by which the clocks are compared with the stars, so that calling T and t the number of transit observations taken at each, by which the clock's errors are obtained, the function expressive of the weight of any night's observations will be 126 Mr. HERSCHEL'S account of a series of observations, &c.
