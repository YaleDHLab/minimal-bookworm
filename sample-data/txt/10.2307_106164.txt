[340] Received May 13, 1773. XXXVI. Properties of the Conic Sections; deduced by a compendious Method. Being a Work of the late William Jones, Esq; F. R. S. which he formerly communicated to Mr. John Robertson, Libr. R. S. who now addresses it to the Reverend Nevil Maskelyne, F. R. S. Astronomer Royal. S I R, Y O U well know that the curves formed by the sections of a cone, and therefore called C O N I C S E C T I O N S, have, from the earliest ages of geometry, engaged the attention of mathematicians, on account of their extensive utility in the solution of many problems, which were incapable of being constructed by any possible combination of right lines and circles, the magnitudes used in plane geometry. The properties of these curves are become far more interesting within the two last centuries, since they have been found to be similar to those which are described by the motions of the caelestial bodies in the Solar system. Two Read June 24, 1773. [341] Two different methods have been taken by the writers who have treated of their properties; the one, and the more antient, is to deduce them from the properties of the cone itself; the other is to consider the curves, as generated by the constant motion of two or more strait lines moving in a given plane, by certain laws. There are various methods of generating these curve lines in plano; one method will give some properties very easily; but others, with much trouble: while, by another mode of description, some properties may be readily derived, which, by the former, were not so easily come at: so that it appears there may be a manner of describing the curves similar to the Conic Sections, by the motion of lines on a plane, which, in general, shall produce the most essential properties, with the greatest facility. That excellent mathematician, the late William Jones, Esq; F. R. S. had drawn up some papers on the description of these curves, or lines of the second kind, very different from what he gave in his Synopsis Palmariorum Matheseos, published in the year 1706; or from that of any other writer on this subject. A copy of these papers he was pleased to let me take about the year 1740. He had not finished them as he intended; but, in their present state, they appear of too much consequence to be lost; as, it is much to be feared, his own copy, together with many other valuable papers, are; and therefore, I am desirous of preserving them in the Philosophical Y y 2 Trans[342] Transactions, in the manner I at first transcribed them; although, I am aware, they might have been put into a form more pleasing to the generality of readers: I have indeed annexed larger diagrams that what accompanied the author's copy, in order to render the lines more distinct, as all the relations are to be represented in a single figure, of each kind. Mr. Jones, having laid down a very simple method of describing these curves, seems to have been desirous of arriving at their properties in as expeditious a way as he could contrive; and therefore he has used the algebraic method, in general, of reducing his equations; and, on some occasions, has used the method of fluxions, to deduce some properties chiefly relating to the tangents; and, by a judicious use of these, he has very much abridged the steps which otherwise he must have taken, to have deduced the very great variety of relations he has obtained: these he intended to have arranged in tables, from whence an equation expressing the relation between any three or more lines of the Conic Sections, might be taken out as readily as a logarithm out of their tables; this he has only partly executed; but it may easily be continued by those who are desirous to have it done, and are sufficiently acquainted with what follows. From the House of the Royal Society, April 29, 1773. T H E [343] T H E D E S C R I P T I O N O F L I N E S O F T H E S E C O N D K I N D. L E T the right lincs AD, AQ, be drawn on a plane, at any inclination the one with the other. See P L A T E XIV. Fig. 1, 2, 3. In AD, AQ, take Aa, AM, of any given magnitude, and drawn MN parallel to AD. On the points A, a, let two rulers AP, aP, revolve, and cut MN, AQ, in N and Q, so that AQ be every-where equal to M N. Then shall the intersection P of the rulers describe lines of the second kind, or curves of the first kind. Where the right-line A a, is the first, or transverse diame ter. The point C, bisecting the diameter Aa, is the center. The right-line PD, drawn parallel to AQ, is the ordinate to the diameter Aa. The part AD, or CD, of the diameter, is the absciss, when reckoned to begin from A to C, or from C to A. The right line B b drawn from the center C parallel to the ordinate PD, and terminated in the curve, is called the second, or conjugate diameter. Those diameters to which the ordinates are perpendicular, are called the axes. And AM is the parameter to the diameter Aa. T H E [344] T H E P R O P E R T I E S O F L I N E S O F T H E S E C O N D K I N D. 1. Put Aa = d = 2AC = 2t; Bb = ~ = 2BC = 2c; AM = 2p; PD = y; CD = x; AD = u. Then ~PD2 = p/t ~ ADa. Or yy = p/t ~ u ~ ~d ~ u = 2pu ~ p/tuu = p/t ~ ~~ tt ~ xx = ~ pt ~ p/t x2. For PD = AM ~ AD/MN = AQ ~ Da/Aa (by sim. ~ s). Th. ~PD2 = AM/Aa ~ ADa. 2. Consequently t/pyy = ~ tt ~ xx = du ~ uu = ~ 1/4dd ~ xx. 3. Hence t/pyy = ~ xx = ~t ~ u ~ u = xu. 4. And pt = cc, or 2pd = ~~; for when y = c = 1/2~, then x = 0. 5. Therefore ~PD2/ADa = yy/~tt~xx = p/t = 2p/d = 2pd/dd = pt/tt = ~~/dd = cc/tt = ~BC2/~AC2. 6. The curve line whose property is yy + p/tuu 2pu = 0, (where the abscissa begins at the curve), Or yy + co/ttxx cc = 0, (where it begins at the center), is called an Ellipsis. This curve returns into itself. For when x = 0, then y = c; and when y = 0, then x = t. Which can happen but two ways. 7. The curve line whose property is yy p/tuu 2pu = 0, Or yy cc/ttxx + cc = 0, is called an Hyperbola. This curve spreads out infinitely. For y increases as x increases; and has four legs tending contrary ways: for xx, or yy, may be produced as well from -x, or -y; as from +x, or +y. 8. If the point a, is supposed to be at an infinite distance from A, so that a ruler ~ moves in a parallel position to AD; then ~ yy = 2pu, or yy 0, the property of the curve described, and is called a Parabola. This curve spreads out infinitely; for y increases as u increases. 9. Let [345] 9. Let Aa, Pp, be any two first diameters; Bb, Qq, their second diameters. PLATE XIV. Fig. 4. Draw the ordinates PD, QE, to the diameter Aa, and the ordinate Pd, to the diameter B b. Let PT be a tangent, and PM be perpendicular, to the curve, in ~; PT cutting Aa, Bb, produced, in T, t; and PM, in M, m. Put the subtangent DT = s, dt = ~. Let AT = r, PM = ~, CE = w, CT = q = x = s = t = r. Put s, s', = sine and cosine of the angle MPD, or angle P m B. R = tabular radius. Then CDT = x s = t ~ u x s = t/p yy = tt/cc yy = ~ tt ~ xx = u x d ~ u = ADa. For u x t ~ u = (t/p yy =) ~yy. Therefore (u/y = ~y/t~u =) ~y/x = s/y (by sim. ~ s). And cdt = y~ = p/~xx = cc/tt xx = ~ cc ~ yy = Bdb. For (u/y =) ~y/x = x/~. 10. Hence AC2 = tt = x x x ~ s = x x t ~ r = xq = DCT. 11. And BC2 = cc = y x y + ~ = y x c t = d c t. 12. Consequently P ~2/B d b = xx/~ cc ~ yy = tt/cc = AC2/BC2. 13. Also CE2 = ww = (DT2 x Q E2/P D2 = DT2 xAEa/ADa =) ssxtt-ww/sx=sx=tt/ccyy = ADa = CDT. 14. Therefore AEa = (CE2/DT2 x Ada = sx/ss x sx =) xx = CD2. 15. And QE2 = (P D2/A D~ x A Ea =) cc/ttxx = p/txx. In [346] In the general schemes. PLATE XV. and Fig. 5. PLATE XIV. 16. Let Aa, Bb, be the longest and shortest axes. Draw C ~ perpendicular to the tangent PT, cutting it in ~. Put CP = T; CQ = C; C~ = ~. Then C~ = ~ = (CtXCE/CQ = cc/yyXty/cc =) tc/C = ACXCB/CQ. Hence the parallelogram, under the two axes, is equal to the parallelogram under any two diameters. 17. Draw the tangents AN, an, to any vertices A, a, meeting any diameters Pp, Qq, produced in V, U, and v, u, and the tangent PT in N, n. Then AU = (CAXEQ/CE =) px/p. And AV = (CAXPD/CD =) ty/x. 18. Also CU = (AUXCQ/EQ =) cC/y. And CV = (CPXCA/CD =) tT/x. 19. Hence PV = CV~CP =) TXt~x/x. And pV = TXt+x/x. Also QU = (CU~CQ =) CXc~y/y. And qU = CXc+y/y. 20. When Aa and Bb are the longest and shortest axes; and when y = p, Then xx = tt~t/pyy will become tt~pt = tt~cc, which call ff. And CD = x, will become CF = Cf = f. The points F, f, are called the Focii. 21. Hence AF = af = ~~~f; Af = aF = t+f. 22. Also ~CF2 = ~Cf2 = ff = ~tt~cc = ~tt~pt. And in the ellipsis, ~AC2 = (~BC2 + ~CF2 =) ~BF2. in the hyperbola, ~CF2 = (~AC2 + ~BC2 =) ~BA2. Hence, a circle described from B, with the distance AC in the ellipsis, or from C, with the distance AB in the hyperbola, will cut the axis Aa in the focii F, f. 23. Draw [347] 23. Draw FP, fP, from the focii F, f, to any point P of the curve; and draw the conjugate diameters Pp, Qq. Put PF = z; Pf = v; PC=T; QC=C; f/t=~; f/c=~. Then Pf2=vv=yy+xx+2xf+ff=tt+2fx+ff/ttxx=TT+ff+2fx. PF2=zz=yy+xx-2xf+ff=tt-2fx+ff/ttxx=TT+ff-2fx. For yy=(cc/ttXtt~xx=)tt~ff/ttXtt~xx. 24. Pf=v= (~tt+2fx+ff/ttxx=) t + f/tx=t + ~x=tt+fx/t.

Hence ~ P x z = ~ P z x; and ~ mxz = ~ mzx. For Pm is perpendicuiar to zx. Consequently, the angles Pzm, Pxm; PZM, PXM are equal. 107. And the triangles Pzm, Pxm, are similar and equal: And so are the triangles PZM, PXM. Consequently, the trapezias Pzmx, PZMX, are similar. 108. Let CR, Cr, cut PF, Pf, in K, k. Then CK= (CFXPf/Ff=) 1/2Pf=Pk=kr. And Ck= (CfXPF/Ff=) 1/2PF=PK=KR. 109. Also PX= PZ= (PM/Pm X PZ= cC/t X c/tC X t=) cc/t= (pt/t=) p. 110. The [359] 110. The Trapezias FGhR, PDFR, frtC, are similar, and consequently their corresponding parts are proportional. FG/PD = Gh/DF = hR/FR = RF/RP That is, fr = rt = tc = Cf For the triangles R F h, R P F, and F h G, F P D, are similar. 111. The Trapezias C~PD, tCMP are similar, and consequently their corresponding parts are proportional. That is, C~/tC = ~P/CM = PD/PM = DC/Pt. 112. And CR, Cr, are parallel to Pf, PF, and equal to CA. For RTf = CTP = rTF. 113. Let ~ = sine of the ~ tPf, or TPF; R=tabular radius. Then R/~= (Pf/fr=) C/c = ~zv/c. Put ~ = sine of the ~ PCQ, made by any diameter and its ordinate. Then TT/CC = 1/2ff~~ 1/4f4 S r2t2c2/~2; tt/cc = 1/2FF~~ 1/4F4 S T2C2~2/rr. 114. Let the parallels PFII, C~r, pf~ be drawn, cutting the curve in ~, ~, ~.; and ordinately applied to some diameter (2~), whose parameter is 2~, and semiconjugate C~=X, to which P~ is ordinately applied at ~. Then C~= (PF+~f/2 = PF+F~/2=) 1/2z + 1/2z~ = 1/2P~ = (C~2/Cr=) C~2/AC = XX/t = ~~/t. 115. C~2 = (1/2ACXP~=) 1/2t X z+z~ = (AC2 X PF~/A~a=) tt/cczz~ = t/pzz~. 116.
