S. communicated to the Royal Society, by Mr. Francis Drake of York, Antiquary and F. R. S. A S York was undoubtedly the Roman, Imperial City of Britain: So is it still, casually throwing up Remains of its antient Grandeur and Magnificence: Even down to our Time. About two Years ago, in digging the Foundation of a large House, since built, in our Trans Tyberim Street, called Micklegate, quasi Muckle, or Great Street, the Workmen went much below any former Foundation that could be observed on this Spot. And at the Depth of ten Feet, came to a Stone, which upon taking up, appeared to have Figures upon it, but miserably defaced. Upon my viewing of it soon after, I confess, I was at a Loss what to make of it; but judged it some Representation of an Heathen Sacrifice, or Game, and therefore sent as just a Drawing of it, as could be taken, to my very learned Friend Dr. Stukely, who according to his deep Knowledge in the Learning of the Antients,soon after returned me the following short, but curious Explanation of this uncommon Piece of Sculpture. `` The Drawing (see Tab. II.) you sent me, of the `` Bas-relief, dug up in a Cellar in Micklegate, anno `` 1747. is a great Curiosity. 'Tis a Sculpture of Mi`` thras, as usual, sacrificing a Bull. He has on, the `` Persian Mantle, called Candys, and the Phrygian `` Bonnet, York, October 25, 1749. Read Nov. 23. 1749. [215] `` Bonnet, called Tyara. He represents the Archi`` magus, performing the great annual Sacrifice, at `` the Spring Equinox: According to the Patriarchal `` Usage. `` These Ceremonies to Mithras, were generally `` celebrated in a Cave of a Rock; therefore, this `` Sculpture was found so deep in the Earth.'' There is, commonly a Figure on each Side of him, habited in the same manner, standing cross-legg'd: The one holds a Torch up, the other down: Here is only the latter, in your Sculpture; the other is imperfect. ` Underneath, is the Figure of an Horse, inti` mating thereby, the Sun's Course: For in time, ` when the old patriarchal Customs became profaned ` and desecrated into Idolatry; they made Mithras ` to be the Apollo, or the Sun. Whence these ` Sculptures had a Number of Symbols, relating to ` the solar Circuit of the Year, thro' the twelve Zo` diacal Constellations. ` The two Figures attending on the Archimagus, ` are inferior Officers to him. There is a Mystery ` in their standing cross-legg'd, like our Effigies of ` Croisaders in Churches, and it means the same ` thing: For the Cross was one Part of the Mithriac ` Ceremonies. These two, by the different Attitude ` of their Torches, represent Day, and Night, as ` Mithras represents the Sun. The Figure imper` fectly drawn, at the Tail of the Horse, is I believe, ` a Genius, twisted round with a Snake; which ` means the Vitality, imparted to all Things, by the ` solar Power, and Circle. The [216] ` The other Figures are too imperfect, to trouble ` you with Conjectures about them; but they all ` regard the same Design. They are officiating ` Priests, and drest in such a symbolic manner, as ` intimates the Sun's Influence, and annual Motion. ` The Mithriac Ceremonies, as likewise the My` steries of the Antients, were but the expiring Re` mains of the antient, patriarchal Religion; and ` Worship of the true God: As it were, swallowed ` up by Paganism, and the Devil's Inventions. For ` indeed the Patriarchal Religion was no other than ` Christianity antedated. ` For in the Mithriac Ceremonies, and Mysteries, ` they had plainly, the two Christian Sacraments: ` Initiation by Baptism: And the sublime Commu~ nion by Bread, and Wine. Mithras is but another ` Name of a Messiah, in his priestly Character: It ` signifies Mediator. ` Thus writes Tertullian, c. 40. speaking of the ` Devil perverting the Rites of true Religion: `` (He), `` the Devil persuades those that are initiated into the `` Mithriac Ceremonies, to believe an Expiation of `` their Sins by their being baptized: And they are `` crossed on the Forehead, as his faithful Soldiers. `` And likewise they there celebrate the breaking of `` Bread.'' But they did not take these Ceremonies ` from the Christians; they are of a much antienter ` Date; perhaps from the Beginning of the World. ` The Romans became extremely fond of the ` Mithriac Sacreds, whence here you find this Sculp` ture in the Imperial City. I saw an Image of ` Mithras at Chester, and no Doubt there are many ` more in Britain, either destroy'd, or undiscover'd. `` St. [217] `` St. Jerom, in his Epistle to Laeta, writes, A `` few Years ago, your Cozen Gracchus, a Name of `` Patrician Quality, when he was Praefect of the `` City, destroy'd, broke, and burnt the Cave of Mi`` thras.'' This was at Rome, and about the Year 378. Not long after, we may well imagine, your Roman Praefect of York followed his Example, and demolished the subterranean Temple in Micklegate; where this Sculpture of him was found.
