Mynde sc. [524] VIII.An Observation of an extraordinary Lunar Circle, and of two Paraselene's, made at Paris, Oct. 20. 1747. N. S. and of the Eclipse of the Sun, July 14. 1748. O. S. by Augustine Nathaniel Greschow, Memb. of the Royal Acad. of Sciences at Berlin, &c. Translated from the French by T. S. M. D. OCTOBER 20. at Night, the Sky was darkened by a slight Fog, thro' which the Moon appeared of a firey-red Colour, till 8h. 40m. when the Fog was thoroughly dispersed,and the Heavens were overcast with a whitish streaky Cloud. At the same time there appeared round the Moon a Halo (TAB. II. Fig. 7. ABCD) accompanied with four other Segments of Circles, two of which E A F and G H of ten Degrees, were concentric, so as to have their common Center at the Zenith. The Segment or Arch I P L on the North Side, of seven Degrees, was concentric with the great lunar Circle, and consequently had the Moon for its Centre; and in fine the Arch MCN, which faced the Horizon, was of twelve Degrees. Read. Nov. 10. 1748. Besides these four Segments, what was most remarkable was a Mock-Moon or Paraselene B, shaped like a Mock-Sun or Parhelius. The Diameter of this Mock-Moon, tho' ill-determind'd; was of 35 Minutes at least, with a Tail BP opposite to the Moon, as the Tail of a Comet is opposite to the Sun. This Tail varied in its Degree of Light from time to time, extending as far as the Arch I~P L, which, [525] which, as well as the Arch GH, was 4 Degrees distant from the lunar Circle ABCD. The Paraselene B had the same Colours with a common Parhelius, excepting that they were not so lively, but they very much inclined to the tawny, especially on the Side, which faced the Moon. This Paraselene was in the same Altitude as the Moon. Its Tail was much more faint and transparent; inasmuch as Capella appeared thro' this luminous Tail. The lunar Circle ABCD was much weaker to the South, and there appeared no Paraselene on that Side. This Meteor did not seem to undergo any Alteration till 9h. 18~. when the Atmosphere was cover'd with thick Clouds. The Clouds being diminished at 9<inferred>h</inferred>. 32~. the Meteor appeared again, but very different from what it was before; for, instead of seeing a lunar Circle with 4 other Arches of Circles, I saw the lunar Circle D ABD, and on the South Side a faint Arch QR of four Degrees, having the Moon for its Centre in common with the great lunar Circle. There were likewise two Paraselene's, one of which B was to the North, and the other D to the South, as they are expressed in Fig. 8. These two Paraselene's did not cast so strong a Light as that which had appeared before, nor were they so distinctly formed. On the contrary, the lunar Circle was very beautiful, and remarkably bright, until 9~. 50~. when the whole Phaenomenon disappeared, and the Sky grew clear by degrees. The Moon's Diameter was 30~. 30~. On the same Night a very beautiful lunar Circle was observed at Berlin, but without Paraselene's.
