VII. Direct and expeditious methods of calculating the excentric from the mean anomaly of a planet. By the Reverend Abram Robertson, D. D. F. R. S. Savilian Professor of Astronomy in the University of Oxford, and Radclfian Observer. Communicated by the Right Hon. Sir Joseph Banks, Bart. G. C. B. P.R. S. Read February i5, 18i6. ;INCE the publication of KEPLER'S discoveries in astronomy, the attention of men of science has frequently been directed to the problem distinguished by his name, and their exertions have frequently been employed to overcome the acknowledged diffiCulty of its solution. A statement of the various degrees of success, with which these endeavours have been made, is foreign to the present design. An account of this kind is now also needless, as Dr. BRINKLEY'S examination of such attempts, published in the ninth volume of the Transactions of the Roval Irish Academy, affords a satisfactory review of most of the proceedings on this subject previous to the year 1802. After the following methods had occurred to my consideration, and I had fully proved their utility by actual application to examples, I was anxious to ascertain whether any author had anticipated me in the manner in which the investigations are conducted. With this view I examined such solutions as are referred to in Dr. BRINKLEY'S very able Memoir, all those mentioned by MONTUCLA,* of which I could procure a sight,* Histoire des Mathematiques, Tom. II. p. 343, &c. I lhave searched, without success for Lorgna'. and Trembley's publications. 1 28 Dr. RoBERTSON'S expedtitos ehods f calc Uat Ing and some others which hadoccurred to me in the course of my reading. The result of this search is a belief that no one be-fore has aimed at a direct solution througlh t! e sanne smnall angle, and, by means of an equation in which this angle aitd its powers are the only unknown quantities obtaineda quickly converging series for its value in known terms. The stmall angle being found, with due precision, the eccentric anonaly readily becomes knowvn. Mi. DELAMBRE, in his AstronomNy, published at Paris I'l 1814, i l three quarto volumes, calculates the excentric anornaly by a method founded on those of CASSINI LA CAILLE,f SIMPSON, and CAGNOLI-? This eminent astronomer says of it, Ce procede, le plus directe que je connaises, est aussi le plus precis ; il n'est qu9approxi'natif, mais il est totjours exact au-dela des dixiemes de seconde poulr toutes les planetes de notre systetne." That the reader may readily judge how far the third method, which I now propose,' deserves attention, I have annexed to my investigation the calculation by it of M. DELAMBRE'S two examples, and also one relating to the comet of 1682 and 1759. Each of the following methods of solution is to be considered as direct, although it proceeds through the medium. of what is commonly called CASSINI's approximation. This approximation, as here used, can only be considered as the first certain step in the computation. No hypothesis is introducedMe'Moires de 1'Academi de 1'annee I 719. t Legorss Blelmentaires d'Astronomie, Paris, 176I. 3 Essays on several curious and useful subjects, London, I740?

PiS Let ALP be the orbit of a planet, C the centre of the ellipse, S that focus in which the sun is placed, and AMP a circle described on the greater axis AP as a diameter, Let L be the true place of the planet, and AM the corresponding mean anomaly. Throughi L let the straight line ER be drawn, perpendicular to AP, and let it meet AP in R and the circle in E. Let EC, CM, SM be drawn, and let ST be perpendicular to lEC, SG to CM and MN to ST. Then MN is parallel to ET, and NT is equal to the sine of the arc EM. It is easily proved, as in almost every writer on. the subject, that ST is equal to the arc EM. In this Problem it is supposed that AC, CS, AM are given, and it is required to find AE the excentric anomaly, for AE being found-, the true anomaly ASL is easily obtained. In each of the three following methods the angles CMS, CSM are used, and their difference is found by this proportion, MDCCCXvI. S :e Dr. ROBERTSON's expedizious methods of [alculti ) CM + CS:t CM-, CS:;: tan. ~-ACM: tan. _L (CSM -CMS). Hence the angles become known by their sum and difference. As the angle SMN is very small, and consequently the angle MSC nearly equal to ECA in the orbits of almost all the planets, this way of finding the angle CSM is usually called CASSINI'S approximation to the excentric anomaly ACE. FIRST METHOD. Having found the angle CSM, sin. CSM: CM:: sin. SCM:MI., which therefore becomes known. Let z equal the angle SMN, s equal the series expressing its sine, and c equal the series expressing its cosine. Put a equal th.e sine of CMS,, and b equal its cosine. Then, radius being t, ac bs = sin. CMN sin. ECM = sin. ((C".MS -z). Also, : SM : s SN SMXs, and ac-.-bs +SM xs=TN+ SN=EM CMS-z, and therefore CMS Z + acbs + SI\ xs z= z + ac + SM _b x s.

Let z the angle SMN s -the series expressing its sine, and c the series expressing its cosine, as before ; but let a now denote the sine of CSM, and b its cosine, and let MN meet CS in H. Then ac + bs is equal to the sine of the sumn of the angles SMHI, MSC, that is, ac + bs sin. MHA = sin. ACE, the excentric anomaly. We have therefore CE: ac + bs CS:CS (ac + 's) ST= CMS-.

With the design already 136 Dr. RoBERTSON'S expediti ous methods of calculating expressed, I adopted in this example the same data with Mr. IVORY: see Transactions of the Royal Society of Edinburgh, Vol. V. page 236. The preceding method bears a nearer resemblance to that given by KEILL, in his Astronomy, than to any other of which I know. Adapting his manner of proceeding to the figure here used, he puts y _ EM, e = sin. AMf cos. AM, and g = CS. The series expressing the sine of AE, is therefore equal to e ey + jy + ey &c. But the radius, which is i, is 2 2.3 2.3.4 to the sine of AE as CS or g is to ST or EM, that is to y. Consequently y =ge-gfy gey' gfy gey4&c. andthere -n + 77+3 2.3.4 ee fore ge =y +gfy + ge __ygfy 3 gY4 &c. 2 2.3 2.3.4 By reversing this he obtains a series, which, omitting the numbers in the coefficients, converges as the powers of gf CS x sin. AM or I C X A. This degree of convergency to the value of y in the foregoing examples is as follows. In the first example as the powers of .2147379, In the second example as the powers of .2,539oo, In the third example as the powers of .1o86700. In the third method which has been here investigated, the series converges to the value of SMLH as the powers of f CMS-.CS X Sin. CSM ior C +SCs x csi CSM JThis degree of convergency in the foregoing examples is as follows. In the first example as the powers of .oo082o9, In the second example as the powers of .0250438, In the third example as the powers of .0055358. The third method, by which the three foregoing examples the xcetntricfroin the mean anomaly of a planet. 1f7 are calculated, appears to me the most simple and precise in theory, an d the most expeditious in practice of anywhich I hlave seen. This I say with the greater degree of freedom, as I am so well aware of the similarity between its series and that of KEILL'S, and so perfectly convinced of the advantages which it derives from CASSINI's approximation, that I consider it, with the exception of some deviations as a combination of their methods.
