[33] VI. A remarkable Case of a Person cut for the Stone in the new Way, commonly called the lateral; by William Cheselden, Esq; Surgeon to Her late Majesty; communicated to Martin Folkes, Esq; Pr. R. S. by Mr. Reid, Surgeon at Chelsea, who attended the Cure. MR. Simpson, of Little Ormond-Srreet, aged Seventy-five, after having been afflicted with the Stone above five Years, and taking Mrs. Steven's Medicines about a Year before for seven Months successively, without receiving any Benefit, was cut by Mr. Cheselden, March 13. 1741-2. at which time he had a Fit of the Stone upon him, which had continued for ten Days; and when, consequently, the Bladder and urinary Parts were very much inflamed, this, together with his great Age, made the Success very doubtful. However, at his own earnest Request, after Consultation, the Operation was perform'd, and a large flattish round Stone was extracted, weighing very near four Ounces. Read Jan. 23. 1745-6. The Wound bleeding plentifully from the small Vessels, only a Piece of thin wet Sponge was introduc'd, that it might bleed for a while through; intending (if there should be Occasion) to tie any Vessel afterward, that should require it. But, contrary to Expectation, this prov'd the means of stopping the Effusion of Blood; and, from Experience, in many Cases since, it has been observed, that nothing E is [34] is so useful as this Method (thus accidently discover'd). About six Hours after the Operation, the Patient having lost but little Blood, it was thought proper to take twelve Ounces of Blood from his Arm. The Urine flow'd freely through the Wound in about two Hours after his being cut, and also thro' the Penis; and continued to do so, though with great Pain from the Heat and Sharpness of it; which excoriated the Parts about, notwithstanding his being drest every two or three Hours, and the Parts being anointed with a cooling Ointment. On the fourth Day, not having had a Stool since the Operation, an emollient Clyster was order'd; which purg'd him twice, gave him a great deal of Ease, and abated some slight feverish Symptoms that were observ'd. This was repeated once in a Day or two for about three Weeks, he being naturally costive. About a Week after the Operation he complain'd of a Pain in his Sides, had little convulsive Motions in his Bowels, with Faintings, and the Abdomen swell'd: But, on bleeding him eight Ounces, his Pain was removed, and the other Symptoms went off on taking the Confect. Raleigh. in Aq. Paeon. Comp. every Night for a Week. During this Time the Wound began to digest, a large Slough cast off, and in it came away several very small Bits of Stone, which had crumbled off in extracting the Stone with the Forceps. These, by obstructing the free Passage of the Urine, had given him sometimes great Pain, but which was removed by frequently injecting Oil and warm Barleywater thro' the Penis and Wound. At [35] At the Beginning we made use of a Fomentation made of Absinth. Roman. & Flor. Chamaemil. but it proving too sharp for the excoriated Parts, it was left off, and the Parts bath'd with warm Milk, and sometimes Barley-water. His Diet, the first three Weeks, was nothing but Spoon-Meats and light Pudding, afterward a boil'd Chicken, &c. and, in a Fortnight after the Operation, Asses-Milk Night and Morning, from which he receiv'd great Benefit, being very thin, and having a Cough, which had afflicted him many Years, and being of a hectic Disposition. At the End of three Weeks, the Wound was above half heal'd, the Urine began to come chiefly through the Penis, daily lessening thro' the Wound; and when that was near cicatrized, it all came the natural Way, and had lost its Heat and Sharpness; then his Mouth blister'd within, from the Saltness of the Saliva. For which, during the whole Course of the Cure, he drank plentifully of cooling Emulsions with Gum-Arabick, &c. In five Weeks he was perfectly cured, and continues to this Day without any Return of his Distemper. E 2 VII.
