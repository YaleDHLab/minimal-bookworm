A Letter from John Bartram, M. D. to Peter Collinson, F. R. S. concerning a Cluster of small Teeth observed by him at the Root of each Fang or great Tooth in the Head of a Rattle-Snake, upon dissecting it. Mr. Collinson, Philadelphia, July 17. 1734. N E A R German-town, about six Miles from this City, we found a Rattle-snake, which is now become a Rarity so near our Settlements. I took it home, [359] home, and dissected it: In the Head I met with what has not been observed before by any, that I can remember that is, a Cluster of Teeth on each Side the upper Jaw, at the Root of the great Fangs, through which the Poison is ejected. I observed, in the same Case, that the two main Teeth were sheathed in, lay four others at the Root of each Tooth, in a Cluster together, of the same Shape and Figure with the great ones and I am apt to think for the same Use and Purposes, if by Accident the main Teeth happen to be broken as was the Fellow to this that I send you. May not these Cluster of Teeth be placed to supply such a Defect successively for the Support and Defence of this Creature? I am not certain whether this is an uncommon Case; perhaps others have not dissected the Head of this Animal with the Care that I have done. I am yours, John Bartram.
