Air, experiments on, by Henry Cavendish, Esq. p. 119. Principal view in making these experiments, ibid. All animal and vegetable substances contain fixed air, ibid. No reason to think that any fixed air is produced by phlogistication, p. 120. Nor by burning of sulphur or phosphorus, p. 121. Unsuccessful attempts to discover what becomes of the air lost by phlogistication, p. 123-126. Account of two experiments of Mr. Warltire's, related by Dr. Priestley, p. 126. Table of the result, the bulk of the inflammable air being expressed in decimals of the common air, p. 127. Examination of the nature of the dew which lined the glass globe, p. 128. Which is all pure water, p. 129. Examination of the nature of the matter condensed on fiting a mixture of dephlogisticated and inflammable air, ibid. Phlogisticated air appears to be nothing else than the nitrous acid united to phlogiston, p. 135. The great probability that dephlogisticated and phlogisticated air are distinct substances, as supposed by M. Lavoisier and Scheele, p. 141. Enquiry in what manner nitrous and vitriolic acids act, in producing dephlogisticated air, p. 143. Different manner in which the acid acts in producing dephlogisticated air from red precipitate and from nitre, p. 146. Vegetables seem to consist almost intirely of fixed and phloV O L. LXXIV. U u u gisticated [508] <inferred>gisticated</inferred> air, p. 148. Manner in which Mr. Cavendish would explain most of the phaenomena of nature, on Mr. Lavoisier's principle of entirely discarding phlogiston, &c. p. 150-153. Air, Remarks on Mr. Cavendish's experiments on air, in a letter from Richard Kirwan, Esq. p. 154. Experiments selected from Dr. Priestley, to prove that fixed air is somehow or other produced in phlogistic processes, either by separation or composition, ibid. Of the calcination of metals, p. 155-161. Of the decomposition of nitrous air by mixture with common air, p. 161-164. Of the diminution of common air by the electric spark, p. 164. Of the diminution of common air by the amalgamation of mercury and lead, p. 165. Of the diminution of respirable air by combustion, p. 166-169. Answer to Mr. Kirwan's Remarks upon the Experiments on Air, by Henry Cavendish, Esq. p. 170. Result of an experiment of Mr. de Lassone's, made with the filings of zinc, digested in a caustic fixed alkali, ibid. Remarks thereon, p. 171. See Metals. Experiments to determine if fixed air is generated by a mixture of nitrous and common air, p. 172, 173. Curious experiment of Mr. Kirwan's, p. 174. Observation on an experiment of Dr. Priestley's with a mixture of red precipitate and iron filings, ibid. The argument on this subject summed up, p. 175. The generation of fixed air not the general effect of phlogisticating air, p. 177. Reply to Mr. Cavendish's Answer, by Richard Kirwan, Esq. p. 178. Answer to Mr. Cavendish's remarks on Mr. Lassone's experiment with filings of zinc digested in a caustic fixed alkali, ibid. Ditto to his observations on the calcination of lead, ibid. Extract of Dr. Priestley's letter, concerning the black powder which he formed out of an amalgam of mercury and lead, p. 179. Fixed air, produced by the distillation of red precipitate and the filings of iron, cannot be attributed to the decomposition of the plumbago contained in the iron, ibid. Mr. Cavendish's experiment of the nitrous selenite's absorbing fixed air, just, and agreeable to Mr. Kirwan's, p. 180. The permanence of a mixture of nitrous and common air, made over mercury, not to be attributed to common vapour, ibid. Thoughts on the constituent Parts of Water and of dephlogisticated Air, with an Account of some Experiments on that Subject, in a letter from Mr. James Watt, Engineer, p. 329. The author's reasons for delaying the publication of his sentiments on this subject, p. 330. Observations on the constituent parts of inflammable air, ibid. Effects of mixing together certain proportions of pure dry dephlogisticated air and of pure dry inflammable air, in a strong glass vessel, closely shut, set on fire by the electric spark, p. 331, 332. See Cavendish. Humor, or dephlogisticated water, has a more powerful attraction for phlogiston than it has for latent heat, but cannot unite with it, at least not to the point of saturation, or to the total expulsion of the heat, unless first made red-hot, or nearly so, p. 334. A mixture of dephlogisticated and inflammable air will remain for years in close vessels, in the common heat of the atmosphere, without any change, and be as capable of deflagration as when [509] when first shut up, ibid. Accounted for by Dr. Priestley, ibid. The author abandons the opinion that air is a modification of water, p. 335. In every case, wherein dephlogisticated air has been produced, substances have been employed, some of whose constituent parts have a strong attraction for phlogiston, p. 336. Phaenomena observed from combinations of the nitrous acids with earths from which the dephlogisticated air is obtained with less heat than from nitre itself, p. 338. Experiment to examine whether the phlogiston was furnished by the earths, p. 339. Ditto to determine whether any part of the acid entered into the composition of the air, ibid. Ditto to determine the quantity of acid in the receiving water and in the sublimate, p. 341. Ditto of the distillation of dephlogisticated air from cubic nitre in a glass vessel, p. 342. If any of the acid of the nitre enters into the composition of the dephlogisticated air, it is a very small part; and it rather seems that the acid, or part of it, unites itself so firmly to the phlogiston as to lose its attraction for water, p. 344. Any acid, which can bear a red heat, may perhaps concur in the production of dephlogisticated air, ibid. Dephlogisticated air obtained from the pure calces of metals may be attributed to the calces themselves, ibid. General reasoning on the subject, p. 346. Mr. Scheele's hypothesis, p. 347. The heat extricated during the combustion of inflammable and dephlogisticated air is much greater than it appears to be, p. 348. By an experiment of Dr. Priestley's it appears, that nitre can produce one-half of its weight of dephlogisticated air, p. 349. Dephlogisticated air, in uniting to the phlogiston of sulphur, produces as much heat as in uniting with the phlogiston of phosphorous, ibid. Dephlogisticated air unites completely with about twice its bulk of the inflammable air from metals, ibid. Experiments by Mess. Lavoisier and De la Place, p. 350. The union of phlogiston, in different proportions with dephlogisticated air, does not extricate different quantities of heat, ibid. Charcoal, according to Dr. Priestley, when freed from fixed air, and other air which it imbibes from the atmosphere, is almost wholly convertible into phlogiston, p. 351. Enquiry whether all the heat let loose in these experiments was contained in the dephlogisticated air, p. 352. Not to be answered without many new experiments, p. 353. Air, Sequel to the foregoing Paper, in a subsequent letter from the same, p. 354. Cautions necessary to those who may chuse to repeat the experimentmentioned in the foregoing paper, ibid.-356.
