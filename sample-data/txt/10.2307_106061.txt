T O form a triangle with two given sides, that the rectangle under the sine of the angle contained by the two given sides, and the tangent of the angle opposite to the lesser of the given sides, shall be the greatest that can be. Read June 4, 1772. Let [T A B. XII. Fig. I.] the two given sides be equal to A B and A C: round the center A, with the interval A C, describe the circle C D E, and produce B A to E; take B F a mean proportional between B E and B C, and erect the perpendicular F G, and complete the triangle A G B. Here the sine of B A G is to the radius, as F G to A G; and the tangent of A B G to the radius, as F G to F B: therefore, the rectangle under the sine of B A G and the tangent of A B G is to the square of the Philes. ~ Fig. 1.

Now, let the triangle B A H be formed, where the angle B A H is greater than B A G. Here, the perpendicular H I being drawn, the rectangle under the sine of B A H and the tangent of A B H will be to the square of the radius, as the rectangle E I C to the rectangle under A C, I B. But I F is to F B as 2 A F I to 2 A F B, or E F C; and 2 A F I is greater than A Fq A Iq; also A Fq A Iq together with E F C, is equal to E I C; therefore, by composition, the ratio of I B to B F is greater than that of E I C to E F C; and the ratio of A C x I B to A C x F B greater than that of E I C to E F C: also, by permutation, the ratio of A C x I B to E I C greater than the ratio of A C x F B to E F C. But the first of these ratios is the same with that of the square of the radius to the rectangle under the sine of B A H and the tangent of A B H; and the latter is the same with that of the square of the radius to the rectangle under the sine of B A G and the tangent of A B G; therefore, the latter of these two rectangles is greater than the other. Again, let the triangle B A K be formed, with the angle B A K less than B A G, and the perpendicular K L be drawn. Then the rectangle under the sine of B A K and the tangent of A B K is to the square of the radius, as the square of K L to the rectangle under K k k 2 A C, [436] A C, B L. Here, F L being to F B as 2 A F L to 2 A F B or E F C, and 2 A F L less than A Lq A Fq, by conversion, the ratio of L B to F B will be greater than the ratio of E L C to E F C; therefore, as before, the rectangle under the sine of B A G and the tangent of A B G is greater than that under the sine of B A K and the tangent of A B K. C O R O L L A R Y I. B F is equal to the tangent of the circle from the point B; therefore, B F is the tangent, and A B the secant, to the radius A C, of the angle, whose cosine is to the radius as A C to A B. Therefore, A F is the tangent, to the same radius, of half the complement of that angle; and A F is also the cosine of the angle B A G to this radius. C O R O L. 2. The sine of the angle composed of the complement of A G B, and twice the complement of A B G, is equal to three times the sine of the complement of A G B. Let fall the perpendicular A H (Fig. 2.), cutting the circle in I; continue G F to K, and draw A K. Then B Fq = E B C = G B L. Therefore, G B: B F:: B F: B L, and the triangles G B F, F B L are similar. Consequently F L is perpendicular to G B, and parallel to A H; whence G H being equal to H L, G M is equal to M F, and M K equal to three times G M. Now, the arc I K = 2 I C + G I; and the angle I A K = 2 I A C + G A I; also G M is to M K as the [437] the sine of the arc G I to the sine of the arc I K, that is, as the sine of the angle G A I to the sine of the angle I A K. Therefore, the sine of the angle I A K (= 2 I A C + G A I) is equal to three times the sine of the angle G A I; but G A I is the complement of A G B, and I A C the complement of A B G. C O R O L. 3. If (Fig. 3.) any line B N be drawn to divide the angle A B G, and A N be joined, also A O be drawn perpendicular to B N, and continued to the circle in P, the sine of the angle composed of N A P and 2 P A C will be less than three times the sine of the angle N A P. Draw N Q R perpendicular to A B, cutting A P in S; join A R, and draw Q T perpendicular to B N, and parallel to A O; then B Qq = N B T. But B Qq is greater than the rectangle E B C, that is, greater than the rectangle N B V, under the two segments of the line B N drawn from B, to cut the circle in N and V: therefore, T B is greater than V B, and N O greater than O T. Consequently N S is greater than S Q. Hence R S is less than three times N S; and therefore, the sine of the angle P A R (= N A P + 2 P A C) is less than three times the sine of N A P. P R O B L E M [438] P R O B L E M I. To find in the ecliptic the point of longest ascension. A N A L Y S I S. Let (Fig. 4.) A B C be the equator, A D C the ecliptic, B D the situation of the horizon, when D is the point of longest ascension. Let E F G be another situation of the horizon. Then the ratio of the sine of E B to the sine of F D is compounded of the ratio of the sine of B G to the sine of G D, and of the ratio of the sine of A E to the sine of A F; but the angles B and E being equal, the arcs E G, G B together make a semicircle; and, by the approach of E G towards G B, the ultimate magnitude of B G will be a quadrant, and the ultimate ratio of E B to F D will be compounded of the ratio of the radius to the sine of D G (that is, the cosine of B D) and of the ratio of the sine of A B to the sine of A D. Draw the arc D H perpendicular to A B. Then, in the triangle B D H, the radius is to the cosine of B D, as the tangent of the angle B D H to the cotangent of H B D. Also, in the triangle B D A, the sine of A B is to the sine of A D as the sine of the angle B D A (or B D C) to the sine of A B D; therefore, the ultimate ratio of B E to D F is compounded of the ratio of the tangent of B D H to the cotangent of A B D, and of the ratio of the sine of B D C to the sine of A B D; which two ratios compound that of the rectangle under the tangent of B D H and the sine of B D C to the rectangle under the cotangent and the sine of the given angle A B D. 4 But [439] But, when D is the point of longest ascension, the ratio of B E to D F is the greatest that can be; therefore, then the ratio of the rectangle under the tangent of B D H and the sine of B D C to the given rectangle under the cotangent and sine of the given angle A B D must be the greatest that can be; and consequently, the rectangle under the tangent of B D H, and the sine of B D C, must be the greatest that can be. In the triangle B D A, the sine of B D H is to the sine of H D A, as the cosine of A B D to the cosine of B A D. Now, in the preceding lemma, let the angle B A G of the triangle A G B be equal to the spherical angle B D C: then will the sum of the angles A B G, A G B be equal to the spherical angle B D A. And, if A G in the triangle A G B, be to A B as the cosine of the spherical angle D B A to the cosine of D A B, that is, as the sine of B D H to the sine of H D A, the angle A B G, in the triangle, will be equal to the spherical angle B D H; and the angle A G B, in the triangle, equal to the spherical angle H D A. Therefore, by the first corollary of the lemma, that the rectangle under the tangent of the spherical angle B D H and the sine of B D C be the greatest that can be, the cosine of B D C must be equal to the tangent of half the complement of the angle, whose cosine is to the radius, as A G to A B, in the triangle, or as the cosine of the spherical angle A B D to the cosine of the spherical angle B A D. If I K be the situation of the horizon, when the solstitial point is ascending, in the quadrantal triangle A I K, the cosine of K I C is to the radius as the cosine of IKA (= DBA) to the cosine of IAK. Therefore, [440] fore, the cosine of B D C, when D is the point of longest ascension, is equal to the tangent of half the complement of the angle, which the ecliptic makes with the horizon, when the solstitial point is ascending. But, the sine of the angle composed of D A B, and twice A B D, must be less than three times the sine of the angle B A D. In the spherical triangle A B D, the angles B A D, A B D together exceed the external angle B D C. Therefore, in the third corollary of the lemma, let the angle B A N be equal to the sum of the spherical angles B A D, A B D: but here, A N is to A B as the cosine of the spherical angle A B D to the cosine of B A D; and A N is also to A B as the sine of A B N to the sine of A N B, that is, as the cosine of B A P to the cosine of N A P; consequently, since the angle B A N is equal to the sum of the spherical angles B A D, A B D, the angle N A P is equal to the spherical angle B A D, and the angle B A P equal to the spherical angle A B D; but the sine of the angle composed of N A P and twice P A B is less than three times the sine of N A P; therefore, the sine of the angle composed of the spherical angle B A D and 2 A B D will be less than three times the sine of the angle B A D; otherwise no such triangle D B A, as is here required, can take place, but the point A will be the point of longest ascension. If the sine of the angle A be greater than one third of the radius, the point A can never be the point of longest ascension; but when the sine of this angle is less, the angle compounded of B A D and twice A B D, may be greater or less than a quadrant; and [441] and therefore, the magnitude of the angle A B D, that A be the point of longest ascension, is confined within two limits, of which the double of one added to the angle A, as much exceeds a quadrant, as the double of the other added to that angle falls short of it; therefore, double the sum of those two angles, together with twice A, makes a semicircle; and the single sum of those two angles added to A makes a quadrant. P R O B L E M II. To find when the arc of the ecliptic differs most from its oblique ascension. A N A L Y S I S. If (Fig. 5.) B D be the situation of the horizon, when C D differs most from C B, as before, the ultimate ratio of B E to D F will be compounded of the ratio of the radius to the sine of D G (or the cosine of D B) and of the ratio of the sine of C B to the sine of C D: but, when C D differs most from C B, B E and D F are ultimately equal; therefore, then the cosine of B D is to the radius as the sine of C B to the sine of C D. Draw the arc C H I of a great circle, that D H be equal to D B; then, B H being double B D, half the sine of B H is to the sine of B D or D H, as the cosine of B D to the radius; therefore, half the sine of B H is to the sine of D H as the sine of C B to the sine of C D; but the sine of the angle B C H is to the sine of B H as the sine of the angle C H B to the V O L. LXII. L l l sine [442] sine of C B; whence, by equality, half the sine of B C H is to the sine of D H as the sine of C H B to the sine of C D: but as the sine of C H B to the sine of C D, so, in the triangle C H D, is the sine of D C H to the sine of H D: consequently, the sine of D C H is equal to half the sine of B C H. Hence, the difference of the angles B C H, D C H being given, those angles are given, and the arc C H I is given by position. Moreover, in the triangle B C H, the base B H being bisected by the arc C D, the sine of the angle C H D is to the sine of the given angle C B D, as the sine of the given angle H C D to the sine of the given angle B C D; therefore, the angle C H B is given; in so much, that in the triangle C B H all the angles are given. The sum of the sines of the angles B C H, D C H is to the difference of their sines, as the tangent of half the sum of those angles to the tangent of half their difference; therefore, the tangent of half the sum of B C H, D C H is three times the tangent of half B C D. In (Fig. 6.) the isosceles triangle A B C, let the angle B A C be equal to the spherical angle B C D, and let A E be perpendicular to B C; also, C F being taken equal to C B, join A F: then E F is equal to three times E B; and as E F to E B, so is the tangent of the angle E A F to the tangent of E A B; but E A B is equal to half the spherical angle B C D: therefore, the angle E A F is equal to half the sum of the spherical angles B C D, B C H; and consequently, the angle C A F equal to the spherical angle D C H. Here, A F is to C F as the sine of the angle A C F 2 to [443] to the sine of C A F; and C B is to A B as the sine of the angle B A C to the sine of A C B: therefore, C F being equal to C B, and the sine of A C F to the sine of ACB, by equality, AF is to AB as the sine of the angle B A C to the sine of C A F, that is, as the sine of the spherical angle B C D to the sine of the spherical angle D C H. Let (Fig. 7.) the triangle A G B have the angle A B G equal to the spherical angle C B D, and the side A G equal to A F. Then, A G is to A B as the sine of the spherical angle B C D to the sine of the spherical angle D C H, that is, as the sine of the spherical angle C B H to the sine of the spherical angle C H B: but A G is to A B also as the sine of the angle A B G to the sine of A G B; therefore, the angle A B G being equal to the spherical angle C B H, the angle A G B is equal to the spherical angle C H B: and moreover, when the angle A B G is greater than A B F, that is, when the spherical angle C B H is greater than the complement of half B C D, the three angles A B G, A G B and B A C together exceed two right. Hence, (Fig. 8.) towards the equinoctial point C, where the angle C B D is obtuse, a situation of the horizon, as B D, may always be found, wherein C D more exceeds C B than in any other situation: and when the acute angle D B A is greater than the complement of half B C D, another situation of the horizon, as K L M, may be found, toward the other equinoctial point A, wherein the arc of the ecliptic C K will be less than the arc of the equator, and their difference be greater than in any other situation. But, if the angle D B A be not greater than the comL l l 2 plement [444] plement of half B C D, the arc of the ecliptic, between C and the horizon, will never be less than the arc of the equator, between the same point C and the horizon. In the two situations of the horizon, the angles C H B and K M A are equal. S C H O L I U M 1. To find the point in the ecliptic, where the arc of the ecliptic most exceeds the right ascension, is a known problem: that point is, where the cosine of the declination is a mean proportional between the radius and the cosine of the greatest declination. In the preceding figure, supposing the angle C B D to be right, then, because when C D most exceeds C B, the cosine of B D is to the radius as the sine of C B to the sine of C D, and, in the triangle C B D, the sine of C B is to the sine of C D as the sine of the angle C D B to the radius, also the sine of C D B is to the radius as the cosine of B C D to the cosine of B D; therefore, the cosine of B D is to the radius as the cosine of the angle B C D to the cosine of the same B D, and the cosine of B D is a mean proportional between the radius and the cosine of B C D. S C H O L I U M 2. In any given declination of the Sun, to find when the azimuth most exceeds the angle which measures the time from noon, is a problem analogous to the preceding. Dr. [445] P R O B L E M III. The tropic found, by Dr. Halley's method *, without any consideration of the parabola. The observations are supposed to give the proportions between the differences of the sines of three declinations of the Sun near the tropic; but the sine of the Sun's place is in a given proportion to the sine of the declination; therefore, the same observations give equally the proportion between the differences of the sines of the Sun's place, in each observation. Now (Fig. 9.), let A C E be the ecliptic, A E its diameter between ~ and ~, and its center F; let B, C, D be three places of the Sun; B G, C I, D H the sines of those places respectively. Draw C K, B L parallel to A E, which may meet H D, in N and M. Then, by the observations, the ratio of D M to D N is given. Therefore, if B D be drawn to meet K L in O, the ratio of B D to O D is given; and the ratio of B D to D C is also given, they being the chords of the given angles B F D, C F D: hence the ratio of C D to D O, in the triangle C D O, is given; and consequently, the angle C O D will be given: which angle is the distance of the tropic from the middle point of the ecliptic between B and D: for, F P R being perpendicular to O C, and F Q S perpendicular to D B, the angle Q F P is equal to Q O P, the points O, P, Q, F, being in a circle. * Vide Philosophical Transactions, No 215.
