XIV. Continuation of an Account of the Changes that have bappened in the relative Situation of double Stars. By William Herschel, LL. D. F. R. S. Read June 7, 1804. IN my former Paper,* I have given the changes which have happened in the situation of six double stars. When the causes of these observed changes in the double star Castor were investigated, I had recourse to the most authentic observations I could find, of the motions in. right-ascension and" polar distance of this star. But the Tables which have been lately published, in the last volume of the observations made by the Astronomer Royal at Greenwichgive us now the proper motions of 36 principal stars, of which a Geminorum is one; and, as the motion of this star, especially in north polar distance, is very different from what it has been supposed in my former examination, it will be necessary to review the arguments which have been used, in order to ascertain what will be the result of this new motion. We shall here again follow the order of the paragraphs of the former Paper, and denote those which treat of the same motions, with the same letters, that they may be readily compared. Single Motions. (a) The small star x cannot be alone in motion, as we have now, in the new Tables I have mentioned, an evident proof that the large star is not at rest.* See Phil, Trans. for 1803, p. 339.Z Z 2 85;4 Dr. HERSCHEL'S Account of the Cbanges (b) As the observations of the Astronomer Royal have ascertained the motion of Castor, so it is no less evident, from the series of observations which has been given in my Paper, that its smaller companion has also changed, if not its real situation, at least its relative one with respect to the large star. Let us therefore examine, whether the motion of a can be the cause of the apparent change that has taken place in the relative situation of these two stars. The annual proper motion of Geminorum, in right ascension;, by the new Tables, isol,I; which, in 2j31 years, will amount to 3",525. The annual proper motion in polar distance, by the F ~ ~ ~ ~ A a same Tables, is offo; which,l in the same time, will amount to o",94, the former-motion being retrogrades and the latter to-wards the south. Let FP, in Figure 1, (Plate IX.) be the parallel of Castor, and make opal'equal to 2$`78,5; which wvilt be the quantity of its motion in, right ascension in the par lel, when it is 3525 in the equator. At right angles to a P, Mike ' all equal to 94o; and this will represent the motion of the star in polar distance towards the south. Draw the line ax so as to make an angle of 32 47' with the parallel Fz P on the north preceding side, andplace x at the distance of 3765 from a. Then will a and x be the situation in which these two stars were observed in the-year 1779; their apparent distance, estimated in diameters of the large star, being 1'1; and the angle of position, as has been stated 32? 47' north-preceding. If the star x had been at rest while as moved towards a.", the. relative situation of the two stars in the year 1803 would have been represented by cWM x; that is to say, the apparent disks of these two stars would have been hardly It diameter of the largest asunder, and the angle of position x c" PI must have in thme relative Situation of double Stars. tbeen 860 2,' north-precedi-tg. But this is quite inconsistent with the observations that have been given according to which, the. small star, in the year 1803, was situated at x'. It is therefore proved, that the motion of alone cannot account for the change which has taken place. (c) If the motion of Castor should be only an apparent one, ansing from the motion of the solar system, then the proper motion of the sun must be just the reverse of that which the new Tables assign to a Geminorum. This being admitted let us examine what will be the result with regard to the relative situation of the small star, which, since only the sun is supposed to be in motion, must now remain at rest, as well as a. The effect of the parallax, which we are now considering, is invrsely as the distances of the stars which are affcted by it. Hence arise the three cases which have been examined in my first Paper, When a line from the sun to Castor, Oa,* is perpendicular to the line car, joining the two stars, no change in their relative, situation can take place, arising from parallax, which will act equally on both. For, -let a, a-" and a, in Fig. 9, be placed as they were in Fig. i i and the real motion of the sun from 0 to 0', will produce the parallactic motion of Castor from a to a"l. It will also occasion an apparent motion of x, equal to that of a, and in a parallel direction with' it. This star will therefore appear to have moved from x to xi, in the same time that the large star has moved from a to a", so that their relative situation will remain unchanged. (d) If x be placed beyond as the effect of parallax, exerted ire the direction xx", parallelto &a" will be less upon this star than on Castor; and its apparent motion must fall short of the See Figure i. of the former Paper, g56 Dr. HERSCHEL'S Account of the Changes situation x'. The consequence of this will be an increase of the angle of position; but, as we know, from the observations which heave been given, that this angle has been decreasing, it follows, that the small star cannot be admitted to have been at rest, if we place-it farther from us than a. (e) 'When the smallest of the two stars of our double star is supposed to be much nearer than the largest, the effect of parallax will carry it beyond w.' Let its distance from us to that of a be, for instance, as 3123 to 6076. In this case, while s appears to move as far as. a", X will be seen to move to x"; where its angle of position XI a" P', will be just 100 's northpreceding, as by observation it was found to be in the year 1So3. But, according to this hypothesis, the distance a" x" of the two stars, ought now to be nearly double what it was in 1779; -and, since this is contrary to observation, we must also give up this last supposition Double Motions. (f) Let us now suppose a and x to be in motion, while the solar system remains at rest. Then, since there -will be noparallax that can affect the appearance of these motions, they must be real, and proper to each of the stars. But the circum stances that must take place, in order to produce the phenomena which have been observed, are so particular, that we shall soon find the great improbability of such an accidental arrangement of them. as would answer the end. It has already been shown, in the paragraph (c) of the former Paper, that we cannot place the two stars at an equal distance from us; and it would be the height of improbability to suppose them to move in parallel planes. But, whatever may be the directions and velocities of in the -relative Situation of double Stars. 357 the motions of the stars, or at whatsoever different distances we may place them, the effect which is to arise from these combined circumstances is positively determined; for the star a must appear to move at the rate of 3s"1 23 of an arch of a great circle in 232years, and in the direction of 170 31' sout3preceing its parallel; while the star x, in the same time, must seem to move over an arch of 4",179, in a direction of 302 52' south-preceing the same parallel. When these quantities, resulting fromthe proper motions of our new Tables, are substituted for those which have been used in the paragraph (f ) of my former Paper, the arguments which it contains will remain in full force, and need not be here repeated. (g) The same argument which has been used in the first Paper, when the sun and the small star only were supposed to be in motion, will perfectly apply to the proper motion of Castor, as given in the new Tables. For, as this motion is now to be accounted for by the motion of the sun, we have only to substitute the velocity of 3",123, in a direction which makes an angle of 170 30' A6" north-following with the parallel of a Geminorumn, for the quantity of the solar motion before used; and to assign a proper motion to the small star, having a direction of 680 io' south-preceding the parallel of Geminorum, with a velocity which if the star was at the distance of a from us, would carry it in 23? years through 1",4303.' (h) When the sun and Castor only are supposed to be in motion, the former statement of the case will in every respect remain conclusive. Motion of the three Bodies. (i) It remains now only -to be shown, that the arguments which are contained in my first Paper, against the probability of J358q ~Dr. HERSCHEL's Account of the Changes a supposition which ascribes all the observed phenomena to three real motions, will not be affected by the given alteration in the proper motion of Castor. Without repeating any part of the discussion of the former paragraph (i), it will be sufficient if I point out three motions, such as will answer the required purpose. Let the solar motion, as before, be towards x Herculis, with such a ~ velocity as will in 23? years produce a parallactic motion, at the distance and situation of a Geminorum, amounting to 21,2805, in a direction of 6o? 36' 5711 south-preceding the parallel of that star. Let Castor have a real motion, which in 23? years would carry it over an arch of 2",1 41, in a direction of 29' 23' 3" north-preceding its parallel; and let the real motion of the small star be such that in 23? years, at its distance from us, supposed to be to that of Castor as 3 to 2, it would describe an arch of 2",92 12, in a direction of 180 50' 13" south preceding. Then would the parallactic motion of %, 211,28 05, compounded with the real motion we have mentioned, give us an apparent annual motion equal to that which, in Dr. MASKELYNE's Table, is called the proper motion in right ascension and polar distance of this star. And the parallactic motion of xa= 1"J,52o03, com-M pounded with the real motion we have assigned, would also produce an apparent annual motion which would correspond with my series of observed situations of this small star. But, for the high improbability of such an hypothesis, I refer to the paras graph (i) of my former Paper. What has been said of Castor, will apply to every other double star of which the proper motion may hereafter be assigned; f~~~~~~~~~~~ for, unless the parallactic motion arising from the motion of the solar system should completely explain the observed changes, the same arguments will still remain in full force. in the relative Situation of double Stars. I shall nfow proceed to a continuation of my account of the changes that have happened in the relative situation of double stars, either in their position or their mutual distance; and, in the following list of them, it will be seen that, of So changeable double stars which are given, 28 have undergone only moderate alterations, such as do not amount to an angle of lo degrees. None of them however have been admitted, except where the change was at least so considerable, that the micrometer which was used on this occasion could ascertain the change with a proper degree of accuracy. Two of the stars, indeed, have hardly suffered any alteration in the angle of position; but, with them it will be found, that a change in their distance has been so ascertained as not to admit of any doubt. Thirteen of the stars have altered their situation above to degrees, but less than 20. Three stars have undergone a change in the angle of position, of more than 20, and as far as 3o degrees. The six remaining stars afford instances of a still greater change, which, in the angle of position of some of thlem, amounts to more than 30 degrees; in others, to near 40, 50, 6o, and upwards, to i3o degrees. orHerculis. 11, 2. The two stars of this double star have undergone a consi'. derable change in their angle of position. By a measure taken May 20, 1781, it was 21' 28' south-following.-t April 3, 1783, two measures gave 23 29'. A mean of two measures,takeni The numbers after the name of the star, refer to my Catalogue4 of double Stars, published in the Philosophical Transactions. For instance, II, 2, denotes that c" Herculis is the 2.d sta-t in the zd class. + By mistake, the first angle of position in my Catalogue is given 300 35', instead of 71i 2Sf, and should be corrected. See Phil Trans. Vol. LXXIL Part i. Pi Izz*IdDCCCIV. 3 A 360 Dr. HERSCHEL'S Account of the Cbanges Feb. 21 and March 4, 1802, was 31i 38'. By five measures, taken in 1803 and the beginning of 1804, it was 3 14j ;and, June 3, 1804, by a very accurate measure, with an improved illumination of the wires, it was 820 .0o. This gives a change of I110 22', in 23 years and 14 days. It does not appear that the distance has undergone any perceptible alteration. As we have now the proper motion of this star in Dr. MASKELYNE'S new Tables, we are enabled to enter upon an examination of the cause of the observed change; but first it xviIi be necessary to mention, that in this and all the following stars, I have no longer supposed the solar motion to be directed towards x Herculis. A point at no very great distance from this star has been chosen, for reasons which it would lead us too far from our present subject to assign, and which are of no absolute consequence to it. The motion of the solar system, towards this assumed point, will produce an opposite parallactic motion, in every star that is not too far from us to be sensibly affected by it. That change of place which astronomers have established by observation, and which is called the proper motion of a star, either may agree with this parallactic motion, (in which case it will be only an apparent one, the star being really at rest,) or it may be directed to another part of the heavens, so as to differ from our parallactic motion. Whenever this happens, the star will have the following three motions a real,. a parallactic, and an apparent one; the latter being a composition-of the former two. That a Herculis is one of' those stars which has these three motions, will appear thus: the parallactic motion which this star, from its magnitude and consequent proximity, must be zn the relative Situation of double Stars. 361 allowed to have, will carry it, in an angle of about 581 degrees, towards the south-preceding part of the heavens; but the motion assigned to it in the new-Tables, has a direction towards the north. Hence it follows, thata HLerculis has also a real motion, which, by its composition with the parallactic one, produces the tabular apparent one. We are now to examine the effect of these three motions, on the position of the two stars of our double star, in order to see how far they will account for the observed change. The two -stars are sufficiently different in magnitude, for us to expect a difference of parallax, on a supposition that their distances from us are inversely as their apparent magnitudes. The change of the angle of position, arising from a superior parallactic motion of the large star, would have occasioned a retrograde motion of the small one; but this, by my observations, has moved according to the order of signs; its change of situation, therefore, will admit of no explanation from the effect of parallax. The real motion of M Herculis, being such as, with the union of the parallactic one, will produce an apparent motion towards the north, is determined by the velocities and directions of the other two motions. It must however be towards the northfollowing part of the heavens, and of a velocity considerably greater than the proper motion given in the new Tables; but, since it is known to be compounded with the parallactic one, we are now only to consult the direction and velocity of that composition, which is such that the large star, in 2 years and ,4 days, must have been carried 5",2~99 towards the north. If the stars are not connected, the most favourable case we can put, will be to suppose the small one at rest, and at such a distance from us as to be intirely free from sensible parallaxs A2 362 Dr. HERSCHEL'S Account of the Changes This being admitted, the large star, by its motion, should now lhave left the small one so far behind, that the distance of the centres of the two stars, (which Sept. 2d, 1781, by a measure with my lamp micrometer, was 4" 3L"',) should now be 7"'92; while, at the same time, the angle of position ought to have increased to 522 degrees. My last observations, however; give so different a result, that this hypothesis cannot be admitted. If the small star, which is not so much less than. the large one that we can justly place it at the above mentioned distance, should partake of some parallactic motion, it wvill then increase the objec-. tions we have stated; for, if the eflect of it should be only one quarter-ofwhat it is upon the large star, it will add to themagnitude of the angle of position, and increase the distance of the two stars. Hence it follows, that, unless we should admit the supposition of three independent motions, the high improbability of which; has been sufficiently shown, we have good reason to believe that the large star has, during the 23 last years, carried the small one along with itself, in the path it describes in space; both being equally affected by parallax and real motion. If this be admitted, a mutual revolution of the two stars will be the immediate consequence, when the laws of gravitation are taken into consideration; and the change of position they have undergone, will be a necessary consequence of it, ~~~~y ,&ietis'. III, 91v This star being only of the 4th magnitude, and of the third class as a double star, we have no reason to expect a great change in the angle of position; and yet, with the assistance of a very distant observation, which we have in MAYER'S Zodiacal Catalogue, a considerable change may be proved to have taken places in the relative Situation of double Stars. 263 The position, Nov. 2, 1779, was 840 o' southfollowing.* Oct. lo, 1780, it was 86? 5; and, Feb. 7, 1802, it Was 890 10'. The change, in 22 years and 97 days, is s lo'. From the given right ascension and declination of the two stars, in MAYER'S Catalogue, we compute, that their position in 1756 was 78? 46' southfollowing; which gives a change of .5 i4' in 23 years and 306 days, up to the time of my first observation. The two periods, which are nearly equal, give a change of 100 24', for 46 years and 38 days. A motion of y Arietis, arising from systematical parallax, by which we may admit the smallest of the two stars (on account of its supposed greater distance) not to be so much affected as the large one, will perfectly account for the change; unless, hereafter, the prUper motion of this star, when known-, should lead to a different conclusion. , Urso. I, 2. This double star has undergone a very extraordinary change in the angle of position. Dec. 19, 1781, the smallest of the two stars was 530 47' south-following. Feb. 4, 18o2, it was 0 31!'; and, January 29, 1804, the position was only 20 38'. This gives a motion of 510 9', for 22 years 41 days, and amounts to 20 19' per year. If an annual alteration to this amount should continue to take place for the future, a very few years would be sufficient to ascertain the cause of this change, as no motion but a revolving one could possibly explain the phenomenon. If, on the contrary, the parallactic motion of the largest star should have occasioned the change of situation, which is not impossible, it wllI soon be verified by an increased distance of the two stars,.* This position, for reasons explained in the note to p Serpentarii, page 374, haas not been given in. my Catalogue. 364 Dr. HERSCHEL'S ACcOUnt of the Changes accompanied with very little angular change in their position. The little difference in the magnitude of the two stars, however, does not well agree with a supposition which gives a parallactic Motion to one of them only. -y Andromedw. III, A. It has already been noticed, on a former occasion, that this double star is one of the most beautiful objects in the heavens. The striking difference in the colour of the two stars, suggests the idea of a sun and its planet, to which the contrast of their unequal size contributes not a little. The position of the small. star, when we consider that this double star is one of the third class, has undergone a sufficient change to deserve notice. In the year 1781, Oct. 15, it was 190 37, north-following. Feb. SJ 1802, 260 34'. Feb. I J, 1803, 2605'X; and, Feb. 5, 1804, 270 39'. The difference, in22 -years and 1 3 days, is 80 2'. The distance of the two stars is too great to be accurately estimated by their apparent diameters; and measures taken with a micrometer, unless fractions of a second of space could be strictly ascertained, would be useless. If we suppose the small star sufficiently removed not to partake of the systematical parallax of the large one, the change of the angle of position may be accounted for, upon the principle of the solar motion. The stars, however, are hardly so different in magnitude as would be required for that purpose. We ought also to know, whether a proper motion has been observed in this star. p Draconis. II, 13. The change in the relative situation of the two stars of this double star is pretty considerable. rihe position, Sept. 24, 1 8oi, in the relative &tuation of double Stars. 65 was 370 38'. This may stand either for south-preceding or north-following, because the stars were then regarded as being equal. March 4, 1802, a measure of the position gave 5Q0 ' Feb. A, 1804, position 490 o/ south-preceding; and, Feb. 6, 1804, 5o 0'. A memorandum annexed to the observation says, that the preceding star is the smallest but that the diffkrence is so little as to require much attention to be perceived. The alteration, in 22 years and 135 days, is i2 26'. The two stars being nearly of an equal magnitude, we can have no inducement to suppose them to be at very different distances from us. This makes it not probable that the difference of their parallactic motion should be the cause of the angle of position ; otherwise, the direction of that motion would be sufficiently favourable. b Gemninorum. II, 27. The measures of the position of the twvo stars of this double star are attended with great difficulty, on account of the faintness of the smallest; a considerable disagreement will therefore be excuseable. The position, Nov. i8, 178i, Was 85? i' southpreceding. Jan. 28,1802, it was 76021'. Feb. 4, 1802, 7305; and, Feb. 6, 1804, 690 52'. The difference, in 22 years and 8o days, is 15 A59'. We can have no assistance from observations made on the distance of the two stars, which is too great for estimation. A parallactic motion, which, on account of the great difference in the magnitude of the stars, might be admitted, would lessen their distance, and make the angle of position retrograde, which, by nmy observation, has moved in a contrary direction. A connection between the two stars is also rendered improbable, on account of the great number of small ones that are scattered in this neighbourhood, of which our small star may be one; o166 Dr. HERSCHEL'S Account of the Changes so that we have good reason to ascribe the change which has happened in the situation of our two stars, to a proper motion of R. ? Draconis. I,-8. In this star, we have to notice a great change of the angle of position, but none in the distance. In the year 1782, Sept. 4, with 46o, I found the stars to be 1diameter of L. asunder. May 22, 1804, they were still at the same distance of 12 dial meter of L. Oct. 20, 1781, the position was 63" 14' northpreceding; and, May 22, 1804, it was 840 29' which proves a change of 2i1 15', in 22 years and 214 days. This cannot be. owing to a parallactic motion of the large star; for the effect arising from such a motion, would have been directly contrary to the change which has taken place: the angle of position would have undergone a direct, instead of a retrograde alteration. We are consequently assured that ? Draconis cannot be at rest. If future observations on the proper motion of the stars should furnish us with that of e, and if this motion should also fail to explain my observed change of the angle of position, without a change of distance, we shall then have good reason to admit this star into the list of those that have a small one revolving about it. For, to ascribe an additional and indcpendent motion to the small star, would be to have recourse to three separate motions, of given velocities, in given directions, and at given distances; the improbability of which has been sufficiently pointed out. 4Aquarii. II, 7. The position, Nov. 26, 1779, was 71' As north-following. >Sept. -24, 1781, it was 710 39g. June 19, 1782, 720 7'. Jan. 3, 1802. 780 3j. The change is 60 58', in 22 years and 38 days. in te relative Sit ation of double Stars. 367 As the equality of the two stars gives little room for admitting a difference in their parallactic motions, we cannot reasonably ascribe the change of situation to that cause; though, otherwise, the direction of such a motion in the largest of the two, would be siufficiently favourable. The situation of the stars being much insulated, a connection between them may be admitted, with a high degree of probability.* ?Jootis. II, Is. The change in the situation of the two stars of this double star is very remarkable. The small star, April 1i5, 178%, was 650 Sgr north-following the large one. In one of my sweeps, April 20, 1792, 1 perceived the small star in the 2o-feet rev flector; and estimated its position, as it passed the field of view,. to be about 85t north-preceding. When the sweep was finished, I found that this star could not be in the situation I had just seen it, unless it had undergone a considerable change since the year 1 782; and, that no mistake had been made in the estima.tion of this evening, appeared very clearly, by a measure taken of its position, which actually gave 850 43',5 north-preceding. This pointed out a retrograde motion of the small star. March 22, 1795, the position was 84, 56'. April 1it 1802, 82 67'; and, April 2, 1804, I found it 830 4'A mean of the two last measures will give the present situation 8 a6' north-preceding; and the total change of the angle of position, in zi years and 352 days, will be S 41' If it should be remarked, that the measure taken in 1795* The calculation of the probability of a connection, which has been given in the Phil. Trans. for i8oz, page 484, makes it above 75 millions to i, that these two stars are not situated as they are, by a mere casual scattering of them in space.MDCCCIV. B Dr. HERSCHL'S Account of the Chbage appears to be inconsistent, it ought to be recollected, that the cause of this apparent motion remains to be investigated. If the largest of the two stars should pass closely by the smallest, which, on account of its supposed great distance from us, may appear fixed, a very great and quick alteration in the angle of position will take place; but, in a short time the change will become very moderate, and not long after insensible. The same appearances may also happen, although the small star should not be fixed, but revolve about the large one; for, if its orbit were in a plane with the line of sight, it would be seen to move with great velocity, about the opposition, and soon after appear to be almost stationary. That either one or the other of the stars has really had a motion approaching to a straight line, is ascertained from an alteration of the distance; for, in the year i78i, the vacancy between the two stars, with46o, was 3 diameters of the large one. But, April 2, 1804, with 527, their 'distance was greater than estimations by diameters can determine; and, comparing g with X Bootis, I found that the stars of g were farther asunder than those of ir; notwithstdnding, in the year 1782, the former was placed in the 2d class, and the latter in the sd. The change of the angle of position, if it were owing to a parallactic motion, would have been direct, instead of retrograde. 4 Leonis. 1, 26. In a note added to this star, which is the 26th in my second Catalogue, a suspicion is expressed, that the two stars which compose this very minute double star, were receding from each other:* This has since been completely verified; for, having seen the two stars close upon one another, and afterwards by* See Phil. Trans. Vol. LXXV. Part I. page 48. in tbe relative Situation of double Stars. 369 degrees disengaged, as related in my second Catalogue, the separation between them kept on increasing, and, on the 21st of April, 1795, they were 2 diameter of the small star asunder. Feb. 5, 1804, with a power of 527, the vacancy between them, was nearly i diameter of the small one. The position has likewise undergone a sensible alteration. Nov. i3, 1782, it was 200 5 south-following. Feb. 4, 1802, 41' 28'. Feb. 5, 1804, 4ot 17'. ^A mean of the two last measures, is 4ot ,' The change, therefore, amounts to i9',5D", in 21 years and 84 days, and is probably owing to a real motion of X Leonis; for the effect of a parallactic motion would have shown itself in a contrary alteration of the angle of -position. X Mietis. 1X 64. This star is marked as being treble; and the third star, as it happens, is now of use, in verifying the measures which have ascertained the relative change in the situation of the other two. The position of rand its adjacent star, Oct. 29, 1782,was 19 9, south-following; and the third star was in the same line of that angle continued. Oct. 17, 1802, the position was 340 1 ia and, Feb. 6, 1804, by a mean of two measures, 3i1 -5'; which gives a change of 1 0 6', in 21 years and ioo days. That this change has taken place gradually, is confirmed by two observations of the third star. Jan. 15, 1795, the distant star was observed to have remained a little behind, while the near one had advanced; and, Oct. 17, 1802, it was again remarked, that the three stars were no longer in a line, and that the nearest small-star had advanced according to the order of the signs, which had increase I its an le of position. The multitude of small stars in this neighbourhood, and the 3 Rst 370 Dr. HERSCHEL'S Account of the Changes minuteness of the two that have been observed with x, as well as the distance of the farthest, render a connection between the three stars very improbable; nor can the change of situation be owing to parallax, as this would have occasioned a retrograde motion of the small star, which, on the contrary, has been direct. From these considerations we may conclude, that r Arietis has a proper motion, to which we must look for the cause of the observed change. Corborng 1, i6. This very minute double star has undergone a great alteration in the relative situation of the two stars. Sept. 9 1781, their position was 59 1 ' north-following ; and, Sept. 6, 1802, by a mean of two very accurate measures, it was 890 40' north-preceding; which amounts to a change of 3i? 1', in 20 years and 362 days. The distance of the two stars has not been subject to any sensible alteration. Sept. 9, 1781, a very small division might be seen, with 46o. August 30, 1794, they were so close that, with a io-feet reflector, and power of 6oo, a very minute division could but just be perceived. April i,, 1803, with a 1o-feet reflector, a very small division was also visible, with 400, though better with Coo. And, May 15, 18o3, I saw the sepia ration between the two stars, with the same 7-feet reflector, and magnifying power of 460, with which I had seen it 22 years before. The stars differ very little in magnitude; so that: we have no reason to expect any effect from a difference of parallax. Besides if the small one were out of the reach of it, a parallactic motion of the largest alone, would have occasioned the small one to move apparently according to the order of the signs; but the motion has been retrograde. in the relative Situation of double Stars. 1 Fl9 21 Ursa.

A parallactic motion will account for it;unless, hereafter, a proper motion of the large star should be found to have a difierent tendency. EL. 4 Aqquai, 4. The position of the two stars, July 23, 1783, was 81? 30' north preceding; and, by a mean of two observations, August 28 and 29, 18o2, it was 610 L north-following. Both the last: measures are positive, with regard to the position being following and not preceding, as it certainly was in the year 1783. This proves a change of 370 25', in 19 years and .37 days. The distance is perhaps a little increased. Sept. 5, 1782, it was 7 diameter of S. August 29, 1-802, less than ? diameter of S. A parallactic motion of the large star, would have brought on a retrograde motion of the small one, which, on the co ntrary, we find has been direct. This proves a real motion, the nature of which cannot remain many years unknown; its velocity, hitherto, having been at the rate of nearly 2 degrees per year, of angular change.

Near e BootIs. -, 17. There is a considerable change in the relative situation of the two stars of this double star; and, by the assistance of p Botis, it is remarkably well ascertained. This star is so near, that it may be brought into the same field of view with our double star. Sept. 3, 178%, the position was 87' 14' northy preceding and, about a year before, the situation of Jo Bootis had been deter. mined, so that it appeared, from the two measures, that the three stars were almost in a line, the small star being, however, 6 49' on the Jot/owing side. August 30, 1802, the position of the small star was 760 14' north-preceding; which, in 19 years and 361 days gives a change of 1 10 o'; and it was at the same time observed, that when all the three stars were seen together, the small one was on the preceding side of the line which joins this double star and z Bootis. A parallactic motion of the large star, would have occasioned the small one to go in a direct order; but it has had a retrograde motion. Nortb-preceding Fr. 18 Persei.

The great number of small stars in this neighbourhood, is not favourable to a supposed connection between any of them and C Corona, As the two stars are considerably unequal, we may suppose the large-one to be affected by a parallactic motion, which will sufficiently account for the angular change. E Lyra. II, 5 and 6. This remarkable double-double star has undergone a change of situation in each double star separately, which is not very considerable, but deserves our notice, on account of a certain similarity in the directions of the alteration. The position of II, , Nov. 2, 1779, was 5605 north-following; and, by a mean of three observations, taken Sept. 20, 1802, May S6, and 9g9 1804, it was ,59 1 '; which gives a change of 30 9'; the motion of the angle being retrograde. The position of II, 6, on the samne days, was 83' 28', and 750 35', south-following. This gives a difference of 70 53'; the motion being also retrograde. Now, from the position of the apex of the translation of the solar 374 Dr. HERSCHEL'S Account of the Changes system, it follows, that the parallax arising from this principle, cannot account for the motion of both tihe sets of double stars it may explain the change of: the preceding, but not of the following one. The situation of both, however, is in a part of the heavens which is so rich in scattered small stars, that a variety of casual, and merely apparent combinations may be expected. p Serpentar'i Fl. 0.{o II, 4. The alteration of the angle of position, that has taken place in the situation of this double star, is very remarkable. Oct. 7, 1779, the stars were exactly in the parallel, the preceding star being the largest; the position therefore was 00 o' following.* Sept. 24, 1781, it was 90 14' north-following; and, May 29, 804, it was 48 i' north-preceding; which gives a change of 1310,59', in 24 years and etg4 days. This cannot be owing to the effect of systematical parallax, which could never bring the small star to the preceding side of the large one. x Opbiuchi. I, 83.

The object is uncommonly beautiful; but it requires a most excellent telescope to see it well, and thefocus ought to-be adjusted upon e of the same constellation, so as to make that perfectly round. The appearance of the two stars is much like that of a planet with a large satellite or small companion, and strongly suggests the idcea of a connection between the two bodies, especially as they are much insulated. The change of the angle of position, might be explained by a parallactic motion of the large star; but the observations on the distance of the two stars, can hardly agree with an increase of t which would have been the consequence of that motion.

The stars are so nearly equal, that in 1783 I supposed the preceding one to be the smallest, and in 1802 the following one; which occasions the different denomination of the angles of position. If the distance of the preceding star should be much greater than that of the following one, a parallactic motion would explain the change of the angle, but not otherwise.

Jan. 29, 18o4, I examined this star with powers from 527 to M0oo, and saw it as a lengthened star, but not with sufficient clearnesss to take a measure of its position.

A parallactic motion of z will perfectly account for this occultation; for the situation of the two stars, in 1783, was such, that this motion In my Catalogue, the power is called 460, instead of 27, as it should have beenr; and the rest of the observation, with 46o, was by mistake omitted. 3Cs 378 Dr. IERSCHEL'S Account of the Changes must have carried the large star, by this time, nearly upon the small one. b Draconis. 1, 7.

A real motion of the largest star, in a northfollowing direction, may explain this change, which cannot be ascribed to a parallactic motion of the stars. Rigel. II, Em. This bright star has undergone a change of situation with regard to its distance from the small one, which is near it; but, in the angle of position, very little difference can be perceived.

The distance was estimated, Oct. i, 1781, with 46o, to be more than 3 diameters of Rigel ; and, as I supposed it to be380 Dr. HEnSCHEIL9S Account of the Changes one of those double stars of which I might ascertain the vacancy between the two stars, by estimating thenuMber of diameters of the large one that would fill it up, I placed the star in the second class. However, by a measure taken with a micrometer, Oct. 22, 1781, the stars were found to be far enough asunder to come into the third class. By a mean of six measures, which were taken the first i8 months of my observing the star, their distance was 9 32"'; and, by a repetition of estimations, it appeared, Dec. 22, 1781, that the vacancy between the two stars was not less than 4 diameters, and, when the air was tremulous, 4 or A. A fter an interval of more than 21 years having omitted estimations by the diameter, as not very proper to be used with these stars, I vwished to compare their distance with the former estimiations; and, with the same instrument and same magniifying power that had been used before, the vacancy, Feb. 22, 1803, amounted to A or 6 diameters of the large star; so that, certainly, an increase of distance must be admitted. The number of scattered stars in this neighbourhood, and the smallness of the star to which the relative situation of Ribel has been referred, render it probable that there is only a casual proximity, and no real connection, between these two stars. Nor can the change of their relative situation be accounted for by a parallactic motion of Rigel, although we should admit the small star to be without the reach of solar parallax; for the effect arising from parallactic motion, would notonly lessen the distance of the two stars, but would occasion a considerable diminution in the angle of position, neither of which have taken place. As we have now the proper motion of Rigel, in Dr. MASKELYNE's neaw Tables, we can no longer be at a loss for the cause of the change;, for, by a composition of the tabular motions in in the relative Situation of double Stars. 381 right ascension and polar distance, this star, in 21 years and 1+1 days, must have moved about 3",48 1, in ari angle of 790 29' 33", towards the north-following part of the heavens. This would consequently remove it from the small star, which is placed almost in an opposite direction, and would occasion hardly any change in its angle of position; and these are the very phenomena which have been established by my observations.
