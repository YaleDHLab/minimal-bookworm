[ 327 ] XVI. On the Method of Symmetric Products, and on Certain Circular Functions connected with that Method. By the Rev. ROBERT HARLEY, F.B.A.S., Corresponding Member of the Literary and Philosophical Society of Manchester. Communicated by A. CAYLEY, Esq., F.P.S. Received October 18,-Read December 13, 1860. IN a paper printed in the second part of the fifteenth volume of the Manchester Memoirs,' I have given a systematic exposition of Mr. COCKLE'S Method of Symmetric Products, and its application to the finite algebraic solution of the lower equations. In that paper, to which I shall in future refer as my original memoir, I have also defined a new cyclical symbol, and I have by its aid succeeded in effecting the direct calculation of a certain sextic equation, on whose solution that of the general quintic may be made to depend. In an Addendum I have pointed out the connexion between the circular functions which occur in my own researches and those to which we are led by the theory of LAGRANGE and VANDERMONDE, and., by means of the cyclical process, I have given a neat expression for the first coefficient of LAGRANGE'S reducing equation. These researches I have followed up in an article " On the Theory of Quintics," in the third volume of the ' Quarterly Journal of Pure and Applied Mathematics.' My present purpose is not to repeat, but to endeavour to generalize and extend former results. I shall therefore content myself with a very brief resume of my investigations, referring the reader for details to the above works. Mr. COCKLE'S earlier researches on the subject were published in a series of five papers "s On the Transformation of Algebraic Equations," printed in the first and third volumes of ' The Mathematician@.> SECTION 1.

Xn-1 be linear unsymmetric functions of x and of the form xj kIX2+k9,X3+ +kn-2XnI+kn-1Xff where the n-I constants k, k2, ... kl, are arbitrary. Then if a be less than 5, the constants which occur in the n-i functions may be so distributed, and determined as to render the product tr 1(s) or X1X2X .** X, (or, when n=2, X2) symmetric relatively to x; but if n be equal to, or greater than 5, the symmetry is not in general attainable. The product zi.(x) is called the sympnetric or resolvent product according as it is or is not symmetric. When this symmetry exists, ',-i(x) can of course be expressed as a rational function of the coefficients a, 6, c, &c. When it does not exist, we form the analogues of the functions which enter into the symmetric cases, and the symmetric product T1(x) is then obtained by multiplying together the several unequal values which the resolvent product zX-(1(x) can be made to take by the permutation of the .'s; and II(x) may, in this case also, be expressed as a rational function of the coefficients. 2. The simplest case is the quadratic (eb, Gn )e-1(--= Here { f (X) }2=X2= ( X +kX2)2, and it is seen at a glance that when kA -1, X is unsymmetric and X2 is symmetric Hence X2_= (: ')2_ 4 , 4 and the roots of the quadratic are 2a{-6?a~r1( )}-Oab +N/b24aG. 3. The next case is the cubic (a 6, C, diX, 1)3-a( -_X)(Qr-X2)(.X-_3)=O. Assume IX=1l+kx2+kax3, X2=X +k, x2+kjx3, and Tr2($S) =X1X2; tion (a, b, c, .

U329 -then, combining the conditions of symmetry, and rejecting those values of k (k,1 'o k indifferently) which render X symmetric, we find k2+k+1= 0 that is, k is an unreal cube root of unity. Represent this root by A, and put f(z) =x,+c' X2+a2X3; then f(cX2> + eX2?c+ a X3, and * 1 adr2()) f(z) Xf(o2)=(f)2 3x1x2(b23ac). If, in evolving the roots by this method, we replace f(o) by f, and 72(x) by or, there will result f=-l+a Xr2+-jc X3, ..-=x1 + x2+ x3; so that f+f =0(6+3ax, ), ??+y~a~ a(b+3a2), .cf+ a=(b6+3aX3); and therefore f 3+ = (1, -3b, 32ac,33a2d~b 1)3 =a (-2b3+9abc--27a2d) whence, solving as for a quadratic in f3, restoring the value of x, and extracting the cube root, we have f=a ,?2{ -27a2d+ 9abc-2b3+ 3aV'/(27a2d28abed + 4ac3+ 4b3d b2o2Y2} and the roots of the complete cubic are included in the formula !(amf?4'Le~) where m=1, 2, or 3. In my original memoir I followed Mr. COCKLE, and in the application of the theory to the solution of the cubic and the biquadratic, I employed a subsidiary equation of the same degree. This equation was obtained by eliminating x between the given one and 2 z 2 830REV. R. HARLEY ON THE METHOD OF SYMMETRIC PRODUCTS. 4 being rational and so constructed as to make ?(y) vanish. It is true that the evanescence of t leads to an immediate solution, and that when -Y is known, x is also known. But this evanescence is not essential to the theory; and we are conducted to nmore significant results by dispensing with it. 4. For the quartic assume (cyclically) X1-=X +kX2+kx,3+kx4, X2=x1 +k2X2+k~T3+kwX4, X3x=x +k2+kx 3+ kx4, and Z3()=X1 X2 X3. Then, as before, combining the conditions of symmetry and rejecting those values of k which would render X symmetric, we are led to the cubic 1c3+k2-k-1 =0, of which the roots are -1, 1 and -1. Let therefore X1=X1 X2+X3 X41 X2 =XJ+X72 S3 $4 X3=Xl-X2 X3+X4) then 173(X)=X1X2X3= (X$)3-42 $ , X2+ 82X1 23=a3 (-b3+4abc-8a2d)5. The following solution is due to Mr. COCKLE, who communicated it to me in September of last year. It may be considered as an extension of a solution of the complete cubic which I sent to him in January of the same year, andwhich, not essentially differing from the above, has a certain resemblance to that given bly MuRpty in the 'Philosophical Transactions' for 1837. Let f1=X1 -2+X3 X4 7 and f=xl +X2 X3-X4 ; then M A =X1 a2-X3 X4 and as in cubics, f+f2-y =a(b+4ax2), f1 -f2A f = a (+ 4ax3), f f2 +(b+4ax4); REV. R.

Probably no other distribution would render ,4(x) more nearly symmetrical*. Combining, as in former cases, the conditions of symmetry and rejecting incongruous results, we arrive at the quartic k4+k'+k2+k+1=,O of which the roots are the unreal fifth roots of unity.

Since their product is unsymmetric relatively to x, it follows that z4(x) cannot in general be rendered symmetric. Before proceeding to discuss this product, it will be convenient to introduce some other matters connected with the general theory. SECTION 1I.-Circular Functions and the New Cyclical Symbol. 7. In the transformation and general treatment of the higher equations circular functions occupy a conspicuous place, and play an important part. An attentive consideration of the structure of such functions will enable us to devise a calculus whereby operations upon them will be materially abridged. The theory is far from being complete, and its practical application admits of great improvement. In, y original memoir I have proposed and, applied a symbol which not only helps, I think, to throw some light on the general theory, but also enables us to effect with ease and rapidity -calculations which would otherwise be very laborious, if not wholly impracticable. The method there employed exhibits to the eye and to the mind the various combinations of dimen* When all the divisors of X are even, a cyclical arrangement must be adopted, as in the case for quartics (art. 4). When n is prime or odd, an arrangement similar to the above, or a modification of it, will probably be found available.

Combining as many terms (n) in one as thereare roots involved, the cyclical symbol reduces the labour of multiplication alone by %th; and in passing from the circular to the corresponding symmetric function the process also affords considerable facilities. 8. Let X(O) be a function of x, and let X(g) be derivd from (0) by advancing each of the roots contained in its q steps in a given cycle r. Ex. yr.

It should also be remarked that if C be a function or quantity such that it is not affected by the cyclical interchange of the roots, as when it is a constant quantity and therefore independent of the roots altogether, or as when it is a circular function and belongs to the same cycle as !'x(O), then will TmCx(o)cu:lrx(0), The, foregolingr theo~remsn a-re t-rue1 for any1 circulanr fucio---1nns tvxAnPv7r, whether rat-imiona REV.

Since the coefficients of the -several terms in the expression for 'r are equal, we may, in forming its values, regard one of the roots as fixed, while the others are permuted inter se. Thus we shall have 1. 2. 3. 4 cycles, giving rise to 24 corresponding expressions for v; but since, for the first cycle, -1 2 : 1 5f and similar relations obtain for the other cycles, therefore these 24 expressions may be grouped in pairs, the members of each pair being equal. Hence X has only 12 values. In the same way it may be, shown that r' has only 12 values. And since the several values of ra may be referred to the same cycles which arise in the formation of the values of Ar, and since also fr and r' are complementary to each other (for their sum-=fx1 a one-valued function), it follows that Yrt) and therefore also X and Tr(x), are six-valued functions. An independent proof that the resolvent product zr(x) is six-valued may be found in my original memoir, Section II.* art. 15. A 2 338 REV. R. HARLEY ON THE METHOD OF SYMMETRIC PRODUCTS. 13.

Ex. gr. E1262 represents :1 Ell751 represents x"x2x' 4, and so on. 14. We may regard < as the root of a sextic equation; and since the coefficients of any equation may be considered as known, when the sums of the powers of its roots are known, therefore the formulae in the last article may be considered as giving implicitly the coefficients of the sextic in X. The equation in X being once obtained, we may, by a transformation linear in ?A, deduce the sextic in d or in ant. But the high dimensions of the symmetric functions in x present practical (almost insuperable) difficulties in passing to the corresponding functions of the coefficients of the quintic. Mr. CAYLEY has suggested to me a more convenient method, which, however, I must leave its author to expound himself. 15. But if, in place of the complete quintic, we take any one of the trinomial forms XI+ ex +f= 0, X, + de +f= 0 x5 + CX3 +f= 0, x5+ 6X4+f=01 342 REV. R. HARLEY ON THE METHOD OF SYMMETRIC PRODUCTS. to which, by the method of Mr. JERRARD, Mr. COCKLE, or Professor SYLVESTER, the complete quintic may be reduced, then the foregoing formulae may be made available. For, any symmetric function of the roots may be resolved into a function of the sums of the powers of the roots, and these sums, in any of the above cases, can of course be easily calculated. Thus, taking the second form, a5+dx2+f=O, which in many respects is the most convenient, we readily find E l O 2=0, B3=-3d, 14=O, and therefore :Ek=2:1212= (:U)112-2U1N3-(:z2)'+214=0In like manner we obtain x2=4. 52df, Bx3=6d4, >X4=4. 54d~f2, kx5=158.5daf+56f4 1x6 6d8+ 4. 56d f3. Therefore the equation in x is x6_52 d24-2d4X3+54d2f22._ (58d5+55f 3)ft~d`?; and since, in this case (art. 11), 54(X)=-x the corresponding equation for the resolvent product is 06_2 54dfO +2 .53d403+ 58d2f2 2+ 55(58d5+5:P)fO+56d8=O, where I have written v for r4(Qx). This equation was first given by Mr. COCKLE. See his paper entitled " Researches in the Higher Algebra," printed in the second part of the fifteenth volume of the 'Manchester Memoirs.' Some interesting and curious transformations of the equation may be found in the same paper. SECTION III. The Symmetric Product for Quintics. 16. We know that, for the perfect form (art. 11), -a 4= 15a3e-4-5a2bd+5a2c25ab2c+64_5a4x. And by definition (art. 1), H'() = MAM2A3a456. It hence appears that the symmetric product II is of twenty-four dimensions with respect to ax. The partitions of twenty-four, for the quintic, are as follows:REV. R.

See his paper " On Equations of the Fifth Degree," published in the Appendix to the Lady's and Gentleman's Diary for 1858. In the second section of my original memoir I have verified his result by an independent calculation and supplied the constant numerical multiplier. Mr. CocKLE: presented the product in the form of a function of P, Q. S and E, S being given by S=PI+R. Following the notation of my friend, I gave the product in the same form. Bunt the passage to the REV. R. HARLEY ON THE METHOD OF SYMMETRIC PRODUCTS. 347 19. We have thus obtained the symmetric product for the quintic wanting in its second term; but it seems desirable on many grounds to calculate the product for the perfect form. A variety of methods of performing this calculation might be suggested. The reversal of the problem of transformation appears, at first sight, the most easy and practicable, and if in the foregoing expression for II the following substitutions be made, viz.262 + c for c, 460 36c 52 -y5-+d ford, 3b4 3b2 2bd +2 -+efore, 4b5 b3c b2d be 55 58+ 5 -+fforf, the result will be the symmetric product for the complete quintic (I, b,c, eld, e, f AX 1)5-0. But it will be found on trial that this process, though apparently simple, does in point of fact involve prodigious labour. Mr. SAMUEL BILLS of Hawton, who kindly undertook to assist me in the calculation, communicated to me in the early part of the present year that portion of the expression into which f3 enters. But the difficulties of the calculation and the want of means of verifying successive results have led him to abandon the work as impracticable. An equally effective and a much more expeditious process is supplied by the following considerations. 20. It occurred to Mr. COCKLE that the symmetric product for the perfect quintic ' _5Mw45Px3-5Qx 5Rw+E= 0 corresponding expression in P, Q, R and E is easily effected, and I find that the result (as yet unpublished) of the transformation is11 = 514X + 625 P12 +325 P8Q E+2 P7 E2+1 P'Q 3 +2000 P0R +560 P6QR +5 P5R +1 PQRl 250 P9Q 85 P5Q3 +6 P4Q2 +2400 P8R2 +268 P4QR2 +4 P3R2 z 225 p7Q2R -102 PQ3R +6 P2Q2R _ 25 P6QW + 14 p2Q5 + 1 PQ4 + 1330 P6R3 + 35 P2QR3 + 1 Pjt3 + 95 p5Q2R2 7 PQWR2 + 1 Q21t2 115 P4Q4R + 2 Q5R + 336 P4R4 + 2 QR4 + 10 P3QG 58 P3Q2R3 + 14 P2Q4R2 + 32 P2R5 7 PQ'R 7 PQWR4 + 1 QS + 2 Q4R3 + 1WR' 348 REV.

Mr. COCKLE had further noticed that DT is to be regarded as free from M, a condition substantially equivalent to the expunging of the portion 56b+ 4boC of the operator V which will be presently considered. Although he had not accurately completed this process of derivation, yet he had made a near approach to its completion, when Mr. CAYLEY, to whom as well as to myself Mr. COCKLE had communicated it, showed that the same results might be more ifmmediately and conveniently obtained by means of the quantical calculus, and in so doing he incidentally corrected an oversight which I had already pointed out to Mr. COCKLE. In a letter under date September 28, 1859, Mr. CAYLEY called my attention to the circumstance that the several coefficientsof the resolvent equation of the quintic are leading coefficients of a covariant. Mr. COCKLE had previously suggested that the symmetric product 11, or the last coefficient, was such a term. The test that a function of the roots may be such a term is that it is reduced to zero by the operation aXI + 2+bx3+a4+ba5. It is clear that this is the case with respect to each factor of the product a_-fi(Z).f(s ) .J(W) .f(~a)= 5p 1j2P304. Therefore it is also the case with the product itself; and since the like is true. with respect to the other five values of 6, it is also true with respect to any symmetrical function of the six values. Consequently each coefficient of the, sextic in v is the leading coefficient of a covariant. At present, however, we have only to deal with the last coefficient, that is, the symmetric product. 21. 11 is a seminvariant* reduced to zero by the operation * The term " Seminvariant " is due to Mr. CAYIsY, who in a letter to me dated March 22, 1860, says, "The meaning is a function which is reduced to zero by one only of the operators which reduce to zero an invariant. It is in fact the leading coefficient of a covariant. It may also be defined ask a function of the coefficients which is not altered by the substitution of x+h for '." Defined as functions of the coefficients which are not altered by the substitution of x+h for x, seminvariants are what Mr. COCKLE (who discussed such functions some years ago in the third and concluding volume of the 'Mathematician,' and more recently in some of the other journals referred to in the foot-note under the first paragraph of this paper) calls " critical functions." I may add that some years since Mr. COCKLE pointed out that the factors of the resolvent product, and, consequently, the product itself, are critical functions. REV. R.

RI "ARLEY ON THE METHOD OF SYMMETRIC PRODUCTS. 22. But it is noteworthy that the complete value of a seminvariant or critical function may always be deduced from the result obtained when any coefficient (excepting only a the first) vanishes. Thus, for the equation ~~~~(a, b, el d,, el f 5:x 1)5 0, the operator is V=5a'b +4bbc+ 3cad+2dbe+eAf; and if . gr. we write I=I+Ild+2d2+... and suppose I, given, all the other terms can be found.

And it is easy to see how to obtain the corresponding formuhe for the other cases, viz, when the given function is free from either c, e, orf. The extension of the process to equations of other degrees than the fifth presents no difficulty. 23.

A partial verification of this value is afforded by supposing the last two coefficients of the quintic, viz. e andf or (what in effect is the same thing) two of itS roots, say a4 and x,, to vanish. We have then (art. 11 et seq.) dO=d2= ;i(aa+5dx3), S4=C cz~(aa+5 dXI), where I have for the moment written a in place of 5a2&d+5a22-5ab2c+64.

R. HARLEY ON THE METHOD OP SYMMETRIC PRODUCTS. 25. But a more complete verification is obtained by taking the sum of all the numerical coefficients that enter into the expression for 11. That sum is -47 6 1 1 04, as it ought to be. For the roots of (1, 1, 1, 15 15 1x$, 1)5=0 are aZ being an unreal cube root of unity; and for this particular form we have 0=l1110m,> 03= 21+10m, 05=1, 02= -29, 04=4+20w, 06=--24-20a; or 0103=331, O2A=-29, 0A =496. Consequently II-0l d203d50A0= 4 761 104. 26. Another convenient verification is afforded by writing a, 5b, lOc, lOd, 5e, f for a, 6, c, d, e, f respectively, when the sum of the numerical coefficients of the several powers off should be zero*. And the transformed result will be worth having for its own sake, as belonging to Mr. CAYLLY'S standard (a), bow c, c7, e, fKXi, 15 $ Not only the sum of all the numerical coefficients, but the sum of the numerical coefficients of each power off, is zero. The reason is, because the roots of (1; 1) 1; 1; Infi 1)5=0 are included in the form -?+ wm and therefore /-0. So that in this case the symmetric product vanishes identically. In relation to the foregoing property, Mr. CA YLE remarks as follows:-More generally the forms (1, 0, 0,0 0, +f1 IAX)5 (1, 1, 1, 1, 1,fXxy9)5 are equivalent, the modulus of substitution being unity, as is at once seen by writing ~xaf+yf and the leading coefficients of any covariant of the same two forms respectively are therefore absolutely identical. That is, any seminvariant of the form (a, b, c, d, e, fAfx, y)5 will have the same value, whether we write therein (a, b, c, d, e, f)=(1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1+ ), or (a, 6,c, emf)-(loe 1, 1, 1, f ); whence in particular a seminvariant which vanishes upon writing therein (b, c, d, e)= (0, 0, 0, 0) will also vanish upon writing therein (a, b, c, dc e)=(1, 1, 1, 1, 1); that is, in such a seminvariant the sum of the numerical coefficients of each power off is zero.
