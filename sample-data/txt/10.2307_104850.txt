[455] V. An Observation on an Occulation of Cor Leonis by the Moon, on Thursday, March 12. 1747, in Surrey-Street in the Strand, London, with a reflecting Telescope, made by Mr. Short, F. R. S. which magnified about 100 times; communicated to the Royal Society by J. Bevis, M. D. Apparent Time. d h ~ ~ 1747, Mar. 12 8 24 19 The Star immerg'd into the dark Limb. 9 27 4 It emerg'd from the enlighten'd Limb a small Matter to the West of the Moon's Zenith. 44 41/2 The Moon's preceding Limb pass'd the Meridian in the Transitory. 44 21 The Star passed the Meridian. Read March 19. 1746-7. Mr. Short, another Gentleman, and myself, agreed to a single Second in the Immersion, with different Telescopes; but I saw and pronounced the Emersion 2 or 3 Seconds before them. There had been an exact Observation of the Sun's Transit at Noon; and the Clock gain'd about half a Second a Day. We [456] We reckon Surrey-Street 27 Seconds in Time West of the Royal Observatory at Greenwich. Mr. John Catlin had a few Days before deliver'd me a Computation of this Eclipse, corrected from two Places of the Moon, observ'd the 28th of February and the 2d of March 1729, corresponding pretty nearly with her present Situation; as likewise from the Star's Position, as I had rectify'd it from several late Observations; and this gave the h ~ Immersion at 8 261/2 Emersion 9 30 J.
