Observation of the Eclipse of the Sun, the 1st of April 1764, made in Surry street, in the Strand, London: By James Short, M. A. F. R. S. THE morning of the eclipse I had provided the instruments I judged would be necessary for observing it in such a manner as to be satisfactory to the Royal Society as well as to myself. A reflecting telescope of two feet focal length, it's aperture four inches and a half, and it's magnifying power seventy times. To this telescope was fitted a micrometer with an achromic object-glass of 40 feet focal length. Read April 5, 1763. The right honourable the Earl of Morton, now President of this Society, was pleased to honour me with his company, and also to observe; but in different rooms, out of sight and hearing of one another. His Lordship used a reflector of only eighteen inches socal length, four inches and a half aperture, and a power of forty times, to the eye-piece of which a helioscope was adapted, for viewing the Sun distinctly, without the least inconvenience to the eye. The condition of the air was very unpromising, for, besides a general haziness of the sky, thin slow moving clouds were frequently passing over the Sun from 4 [* 108] from the South-west, so that it was by fitts only that the Sun's limb could be seen distinctly. I used a smoaked-glass to defend my eye, and my observations were noted down as follows. ' '' the beginning of the eclipse March 31, 21 4 33 by me. 4 36 by Lord Morton.
