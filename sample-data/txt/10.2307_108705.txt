[ 371 ] XIX. On the Conic of Pive-pointic Contact at any point of a Plane Curve. By A. CAYLEY, Esq., FER.S Received March 1,-Read Mlarch 24, 1859. TfHE tangent is a line passing through two consecutive points of a plane curve, and we may in like manner consider the conic which passes through five consecutive points of a plane curve; and as there are certain singular points, viz. the points of inflexion, where three consecutive points of the curve lie in a line, so there are singular points where six consecutive points of the curve lie in a conic. In the particular case where the given curve is a cubic, the last-mentioned species of singular points have been considered by PLOCKER and STEINER, and in the same particular case, the theory of the conic of five-pointic contact has recently been established by Mr. SALMON. But the general case, where the curve is of any order whatever, has not, so far as I am aware, been hitherto considered;-the establishment of this theory is the object of the present memoir. 1. Investigation of the E!quation of the Conic of Five-potic Contact. 1. I take (X, Y, Z) as current coordinates, and I represent the equation of the given curve by T=(*)tX, Y, Z) =O. Let (x, y, z) be the coordinates of a given point on the curve, and let U-(*3Xx, y, Z1,Y be what T becomes when (x, y, z) are written in the place of (X, Y, Z); we have therefore U=O as a condition satisfied by the coordinates of the point in question. 2. Write for shortness DU-(X36,+YbY+Z6Z)Uj D2U=(X3bt+Y6Y+ZbZ)2Uj and let 11=aX+bY+cZ=O be the equation of a line. It is easy to see that D2U-1l.DU= 0 will be the equation of a conic having an ordinary (two-pointic) contact with the curve at the point (x, y, z). In fact the equation DU= 0 is that of the tangent at the point in, question, and the equation D2U 0 is that of the penultimate polar (or polar conic) of the point, which conic is touched by the tangent; the assumed equation represents therefore a conic having an ordinary (two-pointic) contact with the polar conic, and therefore with the curve. It may be added that the two conics intersect besides in a pair of points, and that the line joining these, or common chord of the two conics, is the line represented by the equation H=-0; and this being so, the constants (a, b, c) of the line II1O can be so determined as to give rise to a five-pointic contact. 372 AM. A. CAYLEY ON THE CONIC OF FIVE-POINTIC 3I Consider the coordinates of a point of the curve as functions of a single variable parameter; then for the present purpose the coordinates of a point consecutive to (x, y, z) may be taken to be x+ dx + 1,d?x+*d?x+#4-d4x, y+dy+4d2+NdV+?d4yj z +dz +Id2z +'d$z +W 4z, values which, substituted for X, Y, Z, must satisfy the equationrs T=O, D2U-17.DU=O. 4. 1 write for shortness a1=dx ?+dy+dza 2S -d;xd +d2gfO +d2zt B4=dZx+dfyr+d4zt, then the consecutive value of T is exp. (b1 +2+t3 +Q4)U (Read exp. z, exponential of z, -e-), which 'is (1 +12,+ 2+W?t) X(1 + 3 ) X (1 ++*) J +663 +_b, _ U + alU+ +~~~ ~~~ l 2a1+a + a @U + 2 21J-o + 2) 2 1J = -U, 62U = -E6+M243+~U CONTACT AT ANY POINT OF A PLANE CURVE. 373 5. Next, preparing to substitute in the equation D2U-_E. DU=O, the consecutive value of DU is (x+dcx+PPd2X+ + d3ncx++-d4x)-bU + &c. =( +a6+22+R3+ -24a4)U, where a6 u = (w+yay+zba)U= nU. Reducing by the above results, the consecutive value of DU is _-I 2a6u 1(+3l2 2 ~4 16~+4l3+ 3b2)lj. (3 6) 6A ~ 6. Hence also writing P=ax +by +ez, ~bP=adx +bdy +cdz, bP=adx+bd~y+ed2z, the consecutive value of -IDU is -(P+bP+12P) multiplied 'into the consecutive value of DU, and the product is =P.

We have to reduce the last-mentioned equations; suppose that A, B, C 'ire the first derived functions of U, then the equation bU=0 may be written Adx+Bdy+Cdz=0, and this will be satisfied identically if dx=BP -Cp, dy = C0 -Av, dz =AP,-BB, where A, k, P are arbitrary multipliers, which may be taken to be constants. W ~e hav-e( therefore a =D, where D _(Bv C)x + (CxAv)b + (Ap B4)3. 10. The resulting expressions for b2Ul, b'U, ''U may be exhibited in the reduced forms given by HESSE, viz, if S=Xx+--y +vz, we have = uP2U 2, aU=P3UQ3 2 = P4UU 1 =uP4U-Q4S2 where the values of P2, P3 P4; Q2, Q3, Q4 are as follows, viz. if (a, b, c, J, g) are the second derived functions of U, andl if CONTACT AT ANY POINT OF A PLANE CUPVE. 375 H= a, Ai,g Oh, 4i, f g, f, c be the Hessian; if, moreover, he= -(h, v a, , git t It, ,5 if be the bordered Hessian (we may also write )( R3, C, J , i, P Y, v) where (P, Xi, , 4f 7 , Hi) are the inverse coefficients of (a, 4, ,f, g, h1) viz. J=( _ -f2) &C.); and finally, if for shortness we write Z)1 .= b (D *bL4+yf -a +H .b D -HaI then we have P2= ani <, =(in l)QH, 2~n I Q2 (D = D< Q3=(nI 1)D H, _mD2(rn-I) 2l2H-1 2) 4 1 (m-l)2 o Q4-( ) D (-)3 + m-1)3 In the present case U= 0, and we have I U=-Q2 2, dU= -Q45. 11. Hence, substituting for Q2 and Q, their values, the first and second of the equations for the five-pointic contact give P=2(m-2), a Pi= 2 DH, and observing that FI is a linear function of (X, Y, Z), and consequently that P, bP denote simply the values which 11 assumes when (a, y, z), (da; dy, dz) are respectively substituted for (X, Y, Z), we see at once that these two conditions will be satisfied if we put I= 2 1DH+A.DU, where A is an arbitrary constant, or, what is the same thing, an arbitrary function of (x, y, z). We have thus the general equation of a conic of four-pointic contact. 12. The above value of II gives 'A P-3 I 'AT3 AA 376 MR. A.

I remark, in passing, that the problem of finding the circle of cnurature at a given point of a plane curve, is in fact that of determining the conic having vith the curve at the given point a three-pointic contact, and besides passing through tvo given points. The equation of a conic having an ordinary contact, is D2U-IIDU=O, where 1=aX+bY+cZ, and the condition of a three-pointic contact is a +hby+cz=2(m-2) Let the coordinates of the two given points be 378 MR.

The corresponding values of d2, d2y, d2z are d2x=v dB-PdC, d2y=xdC-Y dA, d2z =pdA-xdB, where we have dA=adlx+hdy+gdz, &c., in which dx, dy, dz are to be replaced by the values BY----Cpj, C4 AAy Ap-BX ; and 62 really denotes what d2X~ + d2y6y + d z3 becomes when the above values are substituted for d2 , d2y, d2z.

If now we treat a6 as an operand, that is, perform the differentiations on the variable quantities A, B, C which enter into b, we obtain or, what is the same thing, operating on b6U with 6, the result is -lajU-b2U+a u(a'a2 and in like manner .a 2U=(63+2 lj2)U, -a t,-aU=(a64+alau ~~ ,.~U (?~+ 3162) U It is, in fact, upon these principles that HrissiEs values of b1U, X aU &c. were obtainedI. and we may by means of them obtain the other expressions assumed in the preceding section. 19.

We have thus 4 0 and thence D2U D2u DH-22 )DU=o as the equation of the five-pointic conic: the investigation has been conducted by meams of the canonical form of the equation of the cubic, but the form of the result shows that it applies to the equation of the cubic in any form whatever. 34. If, however, we continue to represent the cubic by the canonical equation x 3 +y3? + 61xyz= O, the result may be further reduced. We have, putting U= 0,or writing x3'=y3+&-:'= -_ Gl7?// H 1 (1+813)Xyz; moreover, putting U=(, the Table No. 70 gives ?=(1 + 813)2(y3z3+z33Xa+ y3)312112; or substituting for H the last-mentioned value, and putting for shortness Q-y3z3 +z3x3 +x3y3 _ 312xV2y2/z2 we have ? =(I+ 813)2Q; and with these values of H and Q, the equation of the five-pointic conic is DU+(3 + 813)XyZD i-2 7 -(Il+ 813a) 3y3-Z3 DU) DU = 0 where DU -3{ (X2 + 2 lyz)X + (y2 + 2 lzx)Y + (Z2 + 2 lxy)Z} D2U=6 { (X2+ 2IYZ)k + (Y2+ 2IZX)y+ (Z2+ 2IXY)z }, or, as it will be convenient to write it =6(x, y, z, 1z y zX)Y ) DEL=(12Xc2 _(+ 13)yz)X (12y2 _ (I +2Sz)Jr(12Z2_( 2).y; whence, finally, the equation of the five-pointic conic of the cubic X3+y3+Z3+61XYZ= O at the point (x, y, z) is 9(1+813)X3y3Z3(X9 y, Z7 J.go Jy) Iz:X Y~ Z)2 + {(x2+2lyz)X+(y2+2lZX)Y+(Z2+21lx)Z} X f 3x y z [ ( 312x (1 + 21 )yz) X+ (312y2y (1? 2l1)zx)Y+ (+31 z (1+ 21 )ay)jZj I l -Q[(x2+2 lyz )X (y2i+ 21zx )Y+ (Z2+ 2ly )Z] a result which I had previously obtained by a special method. 35. But the expression may be exhibited in a different form by a transfo1rn7tio 388 MR. A. CAYLEY ON THE CONIC OF FIVE-POINTIC suggested by a geometrical theorem of Mr. SALMON'S. In fact the tangent at the point (x,1' y, z) meets the cubic in the tangential of this point, and the coordinates of the tangential are X(y3-z3)+y(Z3-Y3), Z(X3-y3). Calling these , o, 4 the equation of thec tangent to the cubic at the tangential is . +-21nK)X+ (42 +2 kZ)Y + (t +2 1E)Z=Oe Now we have identically, 3X2y2z2 { (322_ (1 +21P)yz)X+ (312y2_ (1 + 21)yz)Y+ (312z2(1 + 21 )zx) Z Q{ (X2 + 2tyz)X+ (y2+ 21zx)Y+ (Z2+21xy)Z} { (V2+2l8)X+ (n2 + 2l)Y + (42 + 2 ln)Z } + U {x22( -y3-3?2lyz)X+yf( z3-x3+21zx)Y +z2(-x3 y +2Ucxy)Z }. In fact this relation will be true if only 3x 2y2Z2(3122 _ (1 +2l13)yZ _-Q(X2+2lyz) + 2 ln8) UX2( -y3 z3+ 2 lyz). And substituting for 4, 7, C and Q their values, the left-hand side is. 3 2y2z2(3l2S2 (1 +213)yz) (x2 + 2lyz)(y3z3 +z3X3 +X3y3 -312ey2z2) _ ,t;2(y3 _5z3)2 2lyz(Z3 X3)(X3 _y3); and expanding and reducing, the result is i2( _(y3+Z3)2_ 3(y3+?Z3)) +21yz(2X3(y3 Z3) +6)+ 12l1X2Z1. whence, dividing by x2, the equation becomes _ (y +z3)(3 +y3+Z3) + 2lxyz (a3 2(y3+Z3)) +1 l2X22y2z2 =(3 +2 lyZ)(X3+y3+Z3+6 xyz), vhich is identically true. 36. Hence in the identical equation putting U=O, we see that the equation of the five-pointic conic may be written 9(1+ 813)X3y3z3(Q, y, z, lX, ly, lIz(X, Y, Z)2 + {(X22+2lyz)X+(y2+2lzx)Y+(Z2?+21xy)Z} x {(Z2 + 2il4)X+(n2 + 21; )y+(42+2 ln )Z} -0O. where , n7, U stand for X(y3-Z3), y(z3-X3), Z(X3-y3), the coordinates of the tangential of the given point, and which puts in evidence the geometrical theorem above referred to, viz. Theorem .The conrnion chord of the five-pointic conic and the polar conic is the tangent to the cubic at the tangential of the given point. CONTACT AT ANY POINT OF A PLANE CURVE. 389 37. The five-pointic conic meets the cubic in the point of contact, considered as five coincident points, and in a remaining sixth point or point of simple intersection. The process by which I originally obtained the equation of the five-pointic conic, led also to the equation of the line joining the point of contact with the point of simple intersection: the equation of this line is r XX((I+ 813)X4+ (41+4114)x2yz +(-212+2l15)y2Z2)i 9X 3y3z3 +Yy ((1 + 813)y4 +(41+ 41 14)y2z+ + -2l+ 215)z2x2) 1 + Zz (( + 813)z4?(4l 41l4)z2Xy+ (-2l2+ 2)x2Jy) 3 -6Q 2y2Z2 X(312e2-(1+ 213)yz) +Y(312y2_(1 +213)zx) + Z(312z2 -(1 + 21)xy)} + Q2 {X(x2+2lyz)+Y(y2+2lzx)+Z(z2+2lxy)} =0. 38. If the conic meet the cubic in sit coincident points, that is, if the point of contact be a singular point of the kind already spoken of, or, as we may term it, a sextactic point, then the last-mentioned line must coincide with the tangent at the point. Represent for a moment the equation of the line by AX+BY+CZ= Q, then this line is to coincide with the line (x2 + 2lIyz)X+ &y2+ 2lzz)Y+ (z2+ 2lxy)Z = 0, or we must have B(Z2 +21xy)C(y2+21zx)0, C(x2+21yz)-A(Z2 +21xy)=0, A(y2 +21zx)-B (x2+21yz)=0, which must be equivalent to a single condition. The terms of A, B, C, which contain aY2+ Slyz y2+2lzx, z2+2lxy respectively, may, it is clear, be omitted, and omitting also a factor 3X2y2z2, we may write A= 3x2yz((1 + 813)x4+(41+ 4114)x2yz+ (-212+ 215)y2z2) 2Q(312X2 _ (1 + 2l1)z) B=3xy2z(( 1 + 81')y4 + (41+4114)y2zx+ (-212+21 )z2 2) _2Q(312y2 _ (1+21)z), and the like value for C. The last of the three equations is 3 (y2+ 2lzx)((1 + 813)X5+ (41+4114)X3yz + (-212+2l5)xy2z2) l-(2+ 2 lyz)(1 + 813)y5 +(41+ 4114)y3ZX+ (12+215)yz2X2)T -2Q{ (2+2l1zx) (3l22 (1+2l1)yz) 2+ 2 lyz)(3l2y2-( 1 + 21 1)zx)} =0, where the function on the left hand is + (1?i8.3)Qxy2_x2y5+ 21(x6z yIz) = 3xyza +(41+4114)2l(X4yz2 Xt4zj2) )} t+( ' 212+2l5) (Xy4z2 X4Z2) -2Q { -(1+2l8)(fsz-x'z) +6l2(x'z-y3z)}, MDcccLIlx.3 390 MR.

CAYLEY ON THE CONIC OF FIVE-POINTIC or, what is the same thing, throwing out the factor z, it is = { 3(1 + 8l3)X3y3 + 61(1 + 813)Xylz(X3+y3) + 3012(1 + 813)X2y2z2 } (x3 -y3) -2Q(1+ 813)(X3-y2); or throwing out the factor (1 + 813) and substituting for Q its value, it is = { 3x3y3 +6xyz(w3+y')+3012x2y2z2 2(y'z2+z3x3+xy3. 3l2x2y2z2) } (X3_ y). The first factor, reducing by the equation X' +y3+ Z3 + 6lxyz, is 3X y (X' +y3)(X' +y3 +z3) + (x +y? +z )2 2(yZ3 + Z3X3 +x y3) =3 3y3+Z3(X +y3z+Z3)2(y3Z3 +Z3X3+X3y3) Z= -z3 (-X'+yl) +3y3 = (z 3_ 3)(z3_y3). 39. Hence putting for the moment M 3_ (y-:3)(Z3_XS3)(X3_y3)' it appears that the last of the three equations is Mz=O; the first and second are of course Mx= O and My=O, and the required condition is M= O, that is, (y3 _ z')(Z3 XI)(X' _y3) = 0, the equation which, combined with the equation of the curve x3+y'+z3+ Gxyz= 0, gives the sextactic points. There are consequently twenty-seven such points, and it is at once seen that these are the points of contact of the tangents to the cubic from the points of inflexion, or, what is the same thing, that the twenty-seven sextactic points form nine groups of three each, such that the three points of a group have for their common tangential one of the nine points of inflexion. In fact, let W be a cube root (real or imaginary) of unity, the three sextactic points of one of the groups will be given by x . ly _O, lx3+y3+z'+ Glxyz=0. Now consider the tangential of any one of these points, its coordinates are , = x(Y 3 _ z3 ) Y1 =y(z _-X'), z1 =z(X3 y'); or, reducing by the equation x-wy=O, X, = Wy(X3 _ Z3), y = -y(x3 _Z3), Z1 0, or, what is the same thing x,i+CyQ =O, 1 =0; that is, the point (x$, y, ZI) is one of the points of inflexion. This is the construction of the sextactic points obtained by PLUCKER and STEINER. 40. Reverting to the equation of the line joining the point of contact of the fivepointic conic with the point of simple intersection, this meets the cubic in a third point, and Mr. SALMON has shown that this third point is in fact the second tangential (tangential of the tangential) of the point of contact, or, what is the same thingCONTACT AT ANY POINT OF A PLANE CURATE. 391 Theorem.-The point of simple intersection of the cubic and the five-pointic conic is the third point of intersection with the cubic, of the line joining the point of contact with the second tangential of this point. 41. I have not sought to verify this theorem by my formula. I remark, that combining it with the before-mentioned theorem, the five-pointic conic is completely determined as follows; viz.Theorem.-The five-pointic conic touches the conic at the point of contact (two conditions); it passes through the two points in which the polar conic is intersected by the tangent to the cubic at the tangential of the point of contact (two conditions); and it passes through the point which is the third point of intersection with the cubic of the line joining the point of contact with its second tangential. 42. The construction for the point of simple intersection leads at once to that for the sextactic points; in fact, consider a point having for its tangential a point of inflexion: a point of inflexion is its own tangential, and the second tangential of the first-mentioned point is therefore the point of inflexion: the line joining the point with the second tangent is therefore the tangent at the point, and the point of simple intersection coincides with the point itself, that is, the point in question is a sextactic point. 43. 1 represent the equation of the five-pointic conic by (a, b, cf, , h)2X, Y, Z)2= 0; the value of a is = 9(1 + 813)X4y3z3 + 3X2y2z2(312X2 (1+213)yz)(x9+ 221yz) Q(x2+ 2lyz)2, in which equation Q=y3z3+z3x3+x3y'312X2y2z2; or reducing by the equation X3+y3+z3+61xyz=0, -y3z3+X3(-X36Ixyz)3l2x2y2Z2 that is, -Q=x6+6lx4yz+312X2y2z2 -y3z3 and we have a= 9(1 + 813)xy3z3 + 3X2fz2(312a4+ (-1 + 413)yz 21(1 + 213)y2Z2) +( +6lx4yz + 31 2xy2z2-_y3z3)(X4 + 41x2yz+41y2z22). We have in like manner 2f 1 8(1 + 813)1X4y3z3 + 3X2y2Z2{(312-y2(1 +213)zx)(Z2+21xy) + (3lZ_(I +213)xy) (,2+ 2izx)} -2Q(y2+21ZX)(Z2+ 2Ixy); the coefficient Of 3 2y2z2 in the second line is _6 12y2z2+ (-1+ 413)x(l+3)_4l(1+23 3)x2,Iz; 3 F2 392 MR. A. CAYLEY ON TILE CONIC OF FIVE-POINTIC or reducing by the equation of the curve, =(1413)x4+ (213214)xz'+ 6 ly2z2. And the coefficient of -2Q is =y2z2+ 21x(y' +z3)+ 411x;yz; or reducing by the equation of the curve, = -21x4-8l2x2yz+y2z2. And we have 2f= 181(l + 813)X4y3z3 + 3X2y2z2((14l')X4+(21-3214)x2yz+ 612y2z2) +2(x6+ 61x4yz + 312x2y2z2 -y'z')(2lX4 8l22yz +y2z2). Reducing the expressions of a and 2f, we find for the coefficients (a, 6, c, f, g, h), [ a= '10+101,x8yz+40l2x6y2z2+(5 +12Ol3)X4y3z3-_ I0 JXy4Z1 412y5z, 2f= 41x'04Ol2x8yz+ (5120l3)v6y2z2+4Olx4y3z0_+ 812y4z4-2yz, which gives the completely developed form of the equation of the five-pointic conic. 44. 1 investigate the coordinates of the point of simple intersection of the cubic and the five-pointic conic as follows: the equations of the two curves are X3+Y3+Z3+61XYZ -0, (or, -b el I, g, h:XX, Y Z)2 = 0 or if we write oc~1, A=c, y=61XY, B=2(gX+J) t=X3 + y3l C =aX2+2hXY+by2; then the two equations are CZZ3 + yZ + 0, AZ2+BZ+C-=O and the result of the elimination of Z will be (oZ~ + rZ +B)(osZ +YZ2+ )=0 where Ze, Z2 are the roots of the equation AZ2+BZ+C= 0; that is, we have a2 C3 + Vy C(B2-2AC) +&6(-B3+2ABC) ==0. +72 CA2 7l BA2 tb~2 A3 | CONTACT AT ANY POINT OF A PLANE CURVE. 393 And substituting for A, B, C their values, but attending only to the terms which involve X6 and Y6, the result is (a3+c38g3+6acg)X6+* +(b3+C38f3+6bef)Y6= 0. 45. But the result of the elimination must obviously be (XyYx)5(Xy, Yx1) = 0, if (xI, y,, zl) are the coordinates of the point of simple intersection. Comparing the two results, and forming the analogous third equation, we may write x5x x=b3+c38f?+ 6bef, y5y' =c3 +a38g3+6cag, z5z =a3+63 8h3+Ca6h, where the value of x5x, may also be written (b+c-2f))(b+cw-2w2.f)(b +C& ,22f ), w being an imaginary cube root of unity, and so for the other two terms. The factors of x5x, might be calculated from the identical equation by2 +2f YZ + CZ2 = 9 (1 + 8 13)w3yIz3(yy2+ zZ2 + 2lYZ) + {(y2 + 2 lzx)Y + (Z2 +21xy)Z} X f 3X2y2Z2 [(3l2y2 (1 + 213)zX)Y+ (3l2z2 _ (1 + 213)Xy)Z] 1 t _ Q[(y2+ 2lzx)Y+ (z2+ 2lIxy)Z] I remark, that putting x =0, we have Y2 + 2f YZ + cZ2= _y3z3(y2y+Z2Z)2, and hence writing 1 for Y, and -1, -w, -wa for Z, we have b + c2f~ =y z 3(y2_ Z2)2, b + ci 2wsf= _y3z3(y2_ W4z2)2, b + C 2 _ 24= 3 3(y2 2Z2)2 and hence the product of the three factors is _ylZl(y2_z2)2(y2 _W 2Z2)2(y2 _W4Z2)2, which is equal to -y9z9(y3z3)2(y3+ z3)2, which vanishes in virtue of the assumed equation x=0. This shows that the function b 3+ C3 -_8f3 +6bcf contains the factor aX. I have not verified a posteriori, but I assume it to be true, that it contains in fact the factor X6, and consequently that the expressions for a, y,, z1 are rational and integral functions of (x, y, z) of the degree 25, and containing respectively the factors x, y, z. 46. In the theory of the cubic, a point which depends linearly upon a given point may be termed a derivative of such point. According to a very beautiful theorem of Professor SYLVESTER'S, the coordinates of a derivative point are necessarily rational and integral functions of a square degree of the coordinates (x, y, z) of the given point; and moreover, there is but one derivative point having its coordinates of any given square degree in2, or, as we may express it, only one derivative point of the degree 4m2. The successive tangentials are derivative points of the degrees 4, 16, 64, &c.; the third point of intersection with the cubic, of the line joining two derivative points of the degrees m2 and n2 respectively, is a derivative point of the degree (mn+n)2. Thus the third point of intersection with the cubic, of the line joining the given point with its second tan394 MR. A. CAYLEY ON THE CONIC OF FIVE-POINTIC gential, is a derivative point of the degree (4+ 1)2, and it is easy to see that the degree is not 9; it is therefore 25. The point of simple intersection of the five-pointic conic is a derivative point of the degree 25; it is therefore, according to Professor SYLVESTER'S general theory, identical with the point given by the former construction; this agrees with the before-nentioned theorem of Mr. SALMON. IV. Independent investigation for the Cubic. 47. The following is, in substance, the method by which I first obtained the equation of the five-pointic conic, for the cubic X3+Y3+Z3+6lXYZ= O. Write for shortness U = x3+y3+z3+61xyz, V =(X2+21lz)X+(yf+21zx)Y+(z2+21iy)Z, W= (X2+ 2lYZ)x+ (Y2+ 2lXZ)y+(Z2 + 2lXY)z, T =X3+Y3+Z3+6lXYZ, P =axlby+cz, [ =aX+bY+cZ. Then X, Y, Z being current coordinates, and x, y, z the coordinates of a point of the cubic (so that U= 0), the equation of the cubic will be T=0, and the equation of a conic having with it an ordinary (two-pointic) contact at the point (x, y, z), will be* 2WIIV= 0. 48. Now imagine from the point of contact lines drawn to the other four intersections of the two curves; in the case of the five-pointic conic, three of these lines will coincide with the tangent V= 0, and the remaining line will be the line joining the point of contact with the point of simple intersection. The equations of the lines in question can be found by JOACHIMSTIHAL'S theorem, viz. if (x, y, z) be the coordinates of a given point, and (X, Y, Z) current coordinates, then if in the equations of any two curves we substitute for the coordinates, Xx+pX, Xy+p.Y, 7Xz+pZ, and between the equations so obtained eliminate X, p, the resulting equation will be that of the lines drawn from the point (x, y, "z) to the points of intersection of the two curves. The point (x, y, z) is any point whatever, and it may therefore be a point of intersection, or, as in the present instance, a point of contact of the two curves; the only difference is, that in either case the degree of each equation as regards (x, p) is reduced by unity, and the degree of the resulting equation in X, Y, Z is also reduced by unity: in the case of a point of simple intersection this is the only reduction; but in the case of a point of contact, the result* I have introduced the factor 2, to make this correspond with the form D2UrIDU=O, in the case in qulestion, rn=3. CONTACT AT ANY POINT OF A PLANE CURVE. 395 ing equation contains the equation of the tangent as a factor, and rejecting this factor, the reduction in degree is two units. 49. Applying the method to the two equations, T=o, 2W-IV=O, and substituting therein for the original current coordinates X, Y, Z the values ?4x+&X, Xy+p-Y, 4z+p4Z, the equations become x3U+ 3x21JV+3x4,2W+pT= 0, 2( 2U+ 24pV c42W)-(xP+(JJJ)(XU+ WV)= 0; or writing U 0, and omitting from each equation the factor pv, the equations become x23V+x. 3W+p2T =0, W,(4 -P)V + l(2W -I-IV) -0; and putting in the first equation x=2WIIV, =-(4-P)V, the result of the elimination contains the factor V, rejecting which it becomes 3(2WflV)23(4-P)(2W-FlV)W+(4-P)2VYT-=O, which is of the fourth degree in (X, Y, Z), as it should be, and represents therefore the lines drawn from the point of contact to the other four points of intersection of the conic and cubic. 50. The equation may be written -3(2W I-IV)((2-P)W+IIV) +(4-P)2 YT=O, and we obtain at once the condition that this may contain the factor V, viz. this condition is P=2; and if this be satisfied the conic will have a three-pointic conic, and there will be three other points of intersection. And writing P=2, and throwing out the factorY Vwe find 3FI2V 611W+4T=O for the equation of the lines from the point of contact to the three points of intersection. And we have now to determine HI so that the function on the left hand may divide by V2. 51. I simplify my original method by the use of a theorem of Mr. SALMON'S, viz. writing T=X3+Y3+Z'+61XYZ, 3P =12(X3+Y3+Z3)-(1 +21')XYZX W=(X2+21YZ)x+ = '312X2(1?+213)Yz V=(xv2+21yz )X+.. , HI=(3l2X2-(1+213)yz U=X3+y3,+z3+ 61xyz H =12(x3+y3'+Z3)-(1 +2P)z we have identically ITH-U? =Wl-1 VY?, and in the present case, since U 0 396 MR. A. CAYLEY ON THE CONIC OF FIVE-POINTIC Hence, multiplying by H and substituting this value of TH, the equation becomes 3H Y-2V 6HIIVW+ 4WH1 -4V1 = or, as we may write it, V(3p1171411)+2W(2H,-3HIIh=O; and we can at once make the equation divide by V, viz, by assuming 2Y-1 + 1AV, where A is arbitrary. We have thus a four-pointic contact. And substituting for 1, and throwing out the factor V, the equation becomes 3H( I+A )41?1+ 2W(-aHA)=0 or reducing, 16(H-.-3Hjj1)-36H2AW+24111I1AV+ 9H12A2Y2 0 which is the equation of the lines drawn from the point of contact to the remaining two points of intersection. 52. I write for greater convenience 4 3 being as yet indeterminate, the equation is thus reduced to 9H3 I H(H23H1) + eW} -6H12111V +0e2V2-0. And we have then to determine ? so that the left-hand side may divide by V; or, what is the same thing, we must determine 0 so that H(HV 3_MII1) + OW 3ay divide by V. This implies the existence of an identical equation, H(H2--3HI1)+OW=MU+NV, which for U=0 would give the decomposition in question; but I have not investigated the values of M and N. -I assume at the outset U=0, and putting, as before, Q-y3Z3+ .e+.23y3_ 3 P2y52Z and writing also S= Xx[(l + 8 13)x4+ (41+ 4114)ey+ (-2P+2l5)y!ZZ2] +Yy[(1+ 8tP)+ (41+ 41)y2Z +( 2l+2l5)z23 +Zz [(1+813)Z4+(41+4114)z2xI+(&212+2P)xy2], I remark that for U=0 we have -yzH +VS + (I +8 8)(QW I3 _yetzLh)=_0 an equation which, obserxing that H_-(1 + 813)xy and assuming also =(1 + 813)2Q, CONTACT AT ANY POINT OF A PLANE CURVE. 397 may be written H(HS-SHY?) +OW= --(1 +81')VS, which gives the required decomposition, so that 0 having this value, the conic will have a five-pointic contact. Reducing by the last equation, and throwing out the factor V, we find 9H13(1 + 813)V6H1201 + ?2V= 0 for the equation of the line joining the point of contact with the point of simple intersection. And if in this equation we write H -=-(1 +83)xyz, and 0 (1+813)2Q, we obtain, finally, for the equation of the line in question, 9x y z'S 6x'g'z2QH, + QV= 0, which is the before-mentioned result. 53. It only remains to verify the assumed equation -xyzH 2+VS+ (1 + 813)(QW-_ 3X2y2z2%) 0.

Addition.-The foregoing memoir was communicated to Mr. SALMON, and I am indebted to him for two notes, containing the extension to a curve of any order, of the preceding investigation for the case of a cubic; I reproduce this extension in the following section. V. Extens on of the last preceding method to a curve of any order. 54. Consider the curve of the m-th order T=o, and in the place of the coordinates write Xx+p(X, Xy+(hY, Xz+pZ, where, as before, (x, y, z) are the coordinates of the point of the curve, and X, Y, Z current coordinates; the term involving Ail vanishes, and dividing out the factor d the equation becomes ?4 -lDU +pX-20D2U +_e-3p2P3U+-xl ?M-4m3D4U+ &C. =. Making the like substitution in D2U -_HDU -0, the assumed equation of the fivepointic conic, the factor w divides out and the equation becomes 2?(m-1)DU+p4D2 U--(P+piH)D2U= 0, or, what is the same thing, XDU 2(m-l)-P +p(D 2U_ rIDU)= and if from the two equations we eliminate X, A, the result, throwing out the factor DU, is (D IIJDU)m-' (2(m-l)-P)D2U(D2u -I DU)m2+ &c. = 0, where all the terms after the second contain the factor DU; the condition i order that the equation may divide by DU, is consequently 2(m-l)-P=2, or P=2(m-2), the condition of a three-pointic contact. Substituting this value, and dividing by DU, the equation becomes hJ(D2U.-[DU)m-2+?D3U(D2UUDU)A-3-_ 4U. U(D2U IIDU)7-44+ &c. = 0, CONTACT AT ANY POINT OF A PLANE CURVE. 399 which will be divisible by DU if -HD2U+2D3U is divisible by DU, and the condition for this is found to be, as before, IT7=ThE DH+ ADU, where A is arbitrary; we have thus the conditions of a four-pointic contact. 55. Substituting this value of HI, we see that DPU-AI DPH. D2U divides by DU, viz. there exists an identical equation, D3U-HDH.D2U=IU+J.DU; and hence if U=O, DU( D. ) , where J is a quadric function of (X, Y, Z). I do not know the general form of this function, but Mr. SALMON has obtained a result which may be generalized as follows, viz, writing for X, Y, Z the values Bv-Ch, CX-Ay, Ap-Bx (where, as before, A, B, C are the first derived functions of U and X, 1x, v are arbitrary), the expression for J is U (D3UDH . D 21)= (m1) (mI, IO5 a formula which will be presently useful. 56. The foregoing equation may be written (P2U)m-3 (-t 1D2U +23D3U) + (D 2U)mf-4 DU { m2) l2 D'U 2 (m 3)1-ID3U -D4U }+ &c. (DU)' ... .-O ~~~ 0;~~~~~ and the term -IID2U+2D3U is equal to (D3U DH. D2U) -ADU. D2U =JDU-ADU.P2U. Substituting this value the equation divides by DU, and throwing out this factor it becomes (D2U)m-3(J AD2U) + (D2U)m-4 { (2 )LI2D2U-*(in--3)IID3U -PD4U } + &c.DU= O; or observing that *IHP3U=H2D2U+ term containing DU, this may be written (D2U)m-3(JAD2U) + (D2U)m-4(H2D2U-jD4U)+ &c.DU= 0. 57. If the equation divides by DU we shall have a five-pointic contact; the condition for this is that -A(DP2U)2 +?3JD2U+ I-2D2U ID4U may divide by DU, or more simply that ---A(P2U)2+ 4_JP2U+9DH) P2U--'D4U may divide by DU, or, what is the same thing, the function in question must vanish in virtue of the substitution of the values BP-Cp, CXAv, AK-B4 in the place of X, Y, A. 3Go2 400 MR.
