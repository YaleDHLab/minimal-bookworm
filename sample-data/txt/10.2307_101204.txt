An Experiment On Aloe Americana Serrati-folia weighed; seeming to import a Circulation of the Sappe in Plants, by the same Dr. Merret. August 4. 1656. this Aloes weighed 21 Ounces, 6 Drams, 2 Grains. Its colour was of a pale-green, consisting of 11 Leaves; it was bound about with a red dry Cloth, and was hung up without Oil, as is usual, in the Kitchin. August (456) Weight. Loss. Ounc. Drams.

The succeeding year being drier and hotter, it lost 3 Ounces, 2 1/2 Scruples, and more than double in the 6 colder, than the 6 hotter Moneths. I kept it about 5 years, and it decreased much about the same proportion. And in the year 1660, hanging it in a colder Garret, it perished. These Observables I had about it, that every Year two of the greater Leaves first changed Colour, and wither'd; and in the Spring-time, there grew out two very fresh and green ones, never amounting to the bignes of any of the precedent; insomuch, that all this time I had the same number of Leaves. And then, these new Leaves were more fresh and green, and not serrated, and thicker also in proportion to their other Dimensions. Whence perhaps it may probably be inferr'd, vid. from the growth of these latter Leaves, that there is a Circulation in this Plant of the Succus nutritius. For, how is it possible, that the Roots, continuing as firm and solid as at first, should supply so much nourishment, as to procreate new Leaves, unless it were from the return of the said Succus, from the old and decaying Leaves, into the Root, and there protruded for the production of new ones? For, all Bulbous Roots, as Garlick, Onions, Tulips, and especially Squils, who protrude their Leaves, placed in a Shop or House, have their Roots lighter, and more spungy; the (457) the Leaves being formed out of the substance of the Root, as a Chick out of the Albumen; in the mean while the whole decreasing in weight, as in the aforesaid Aloe; as 'tis manifest by many Experiments made by me.
