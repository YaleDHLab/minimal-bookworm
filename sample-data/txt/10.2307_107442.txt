XXILI Consideration of varIous Points of Analysis. By John F. W. Herschel, Esq. F. R. S. Read May iq, i814. On the Cakulus of Generating unctionIS I.N whatever point of view we consider the theory of gene. rating functions, whether as the fertile source of new discos veries, or as a medium for exhibiting, in the most comprehensive and uniform point of views, results already known;r, we shall find fresh cause to admire the profound and original genius of its author. To the latter of these objects it is, however, more peculiarly adapted, and perhaps, in the present state of analytics, this may even be considered as the more precious advantage of the two. Such has been the indefatigable activity of those illustrious men, who have devoted themselves to the pursuit of mathematical science, that analysis must be conside .ed as already adequate to every purpose to which we can reasonably hope to see it applied. The attention of the scientific observer must now be directed to those elevated stations, from which distinct and extended views of its arrangement as a whole can be obtained. The calculus of generating functions affords such a station, and commands a wider and more magnificent prospect than any which has yet been opened to the view of the speculative philosopher. It becomes interesting then to extend Its application as far as possible ins this line, and to 'introduce it on every occasion where there seems any Mr. HERSCHELon variouspoints of/nalysts. 41I probability of its coming successfully into play. Such have been in part the considerations which determined me to adopt it as a vehicle in laying before the Society some results of a singular and interesting nature, derived indeed originally from other principles, but which, like all the rest, flow with the ut-. most facility from the first elements of this calculus. In the following pages I have uniformly maci use of the functional or characteristic notation; together with the method of separating (where it could conveniently be done) the symbols of operation from those of quantity. This method I have, perhaps, extended and carried somewhat farther than has hitherto been customary; but, I trust, without losing sight of its grand and ultimate ob ject, the union of extreme generality with conciseness of expression. To avoid the necessity of continual explanattion, I shall here set down the leading points of the system. I. The signs : x ()are used to separate the symbol of opeA ration from that of the quantity operated upon, thus: f (X)) @P log A, { n _ 1 4 ( ). 11. 1. The combiiation of two operations is represented by placing their symbols together in their proper order. Thus, ? (4(x)) is simply written o4s (x). For example, if 0 (x) i + x, and j (x) =x, then Hi (x) =i + x2, and 4+ (x) s. When several operations combined are considered as one, their characteristics are inclosed in parentheses T . Thus f log 0@ (x) ---( log IP) . X. A. The repetition of the same operationf being denoted (by the first rule of this article) by ff,fff, &c. may be more con+44 Mr. HERSCHEL on varzous points of Analysis. cisely represented thusf ; .o 3 f ; and this furnishes us with a general and very simple notation for the reverse operation of that denoted byf. For sinceJmfn (x) _fm+n (x), if we make m = i n -+ 1, we findf-'f(x) =10(x) = x with the operationf no times performed = x Thusj-' is the characteristic of that operation which must be performed onf (x) to reduce it to x: that is, of the reverse operation. This is surely a simpler and more expressive method than that of inverting the characteristic,* accentuating it on the left sidet or below;t or other similar contrivances. For instance, log x= eX= 1+ + + &c. tan x + &c. 4. If a combination of operations, as cf &c. be n times repeated in their order, thus; p4A@;pt. .. (x), it will, by the second and third rules of this article be denoted by ($'J)n: x. It must be observed, however, that (4)n is not the same as qf 8, except in some particular cases. III. i. If any number of functions of a symbol x be added, subtracted, or otherwise combined, the resulting function is expressed by the same combination of their characteristics, observing the following conditions. 2. The actual multiplication of two functions 5 (x) and 4 (x) is expressed by inserting a full point betweentheir charac. teristics, thus, . (x) (x) . 4 (x). A. The actual elevation of a function to any power is thus4 LAPLACE. Journal de 1'Ecole Polytechnique. No. 1S. t MON GE. Savans Etrangers. 1773. : KNIGHT. Philosophical Transactions, 181 I. Part 1.

If F (x) be developable in any series of the form axi + bx6 + cxY + &c. the following abbreviations are used (F: : x-a a. (x) + b. *pA (x) + c . . (x) + &c. and, (F :x=a. {T(x)} + b (x)} + &co Thus (for example) I C d 7_y + dY + d, . + &C. dx I l XX X + Ex + 62x + &C. IV. i. D is used as the sign of derivation. It is, properly speaking, the sign of an operation performed, not on quantity, but on the characteristic which it immediately precedes; by which the operation denoted by that characteristic is altered. For instance: D sin. cos. ; D cos. = sin. But it must be observed that D log. --log.-I. a. The sign D affects only the characteristic next following it, thus, Dpf (x) = (DO) :f (x). If it be intended to affect a combination of operations, the rule II, 2 must be observed. ThusyD (tpf).x, D' (f log. -) : log. x. V. Every functional characteristic is affected by all the cha-s racteristics preceding it, in the same manner as if it were a symbol of quantity. VI. Every characteristic of operation performed on qmantity affects all which follows it, as if it were one symbol. Thus if f (x) =ax" + bxh + &c.; we shall have 441 Mr. HERSCHEL on various points of Analys. f Dp (x) =a D (X) + b {D (x) + &c. This rule does not extend to the signs D, d, A, Sjf, ?, according to the remark in IV. 1. These rules will suffice to explain whatever may appear obscure or capricious in the following sheets. We shall now proceed to their practical application. If p (t) be a function of t, developable in a series A__ t ?? + . Ao + At + ..AxtX + .A t 00 ?

The equation we have just arrived at affords us a method of exhibiting, in a finite form, the sum of the series in its first member, provided we possess the means of obtaining the second; and it appears, by what ve have before remaiarked, that this can be performed, whenever F (hD) ? F (huD) is a rational integral function of D. Thlfs includes among the forms of F those remarkable functions denominated by Mr. SPENCE, Logarithmic Transcend'ents," and we shall now proceed, by the help of the general property demonstrated by that atithor in his-" Essay &c." to derive from these principles the sum. mation of one of the most extensive classes of series which has yet received discussion. Adopting Mr. SPENcE's notation, we will represent the series by the symbol nL (i + x). The property then alluded to is as follows: 4450 Mr. LJERSCHEL on various points of Analysis. *L (x + x) + (i)n.

Ill. On Functional Equtations. The determination of functions frotn given conditions is a point of such importance, not only in the partial differential calculus, but also in a variety of other branches, that it has occupied the attention of the most eminent Analysts, and it muLst be confessed, not without considerable success. Their researches, however, have hitherto extended no farther than to such conditions as involve only the unknown function. S without any of its superior or inferior orders, , 3, . .c <DIN &c. It is to equations of this latter kind, therefore, that we now propose to direct our attention. The successive orders of any function f (x) may be produced, either by actually writing] (x) for x in the expression of f (x), in which case the general value of JZ (x) must be concluded from induction; or more elegantly by the following method. Assumef (x) u3 and we havef+I (*) 0 = 1z + I.y UZ ): an equation of differences whose integral will be of the formn u F (z, C) C being an arbitrary quantity independent on z. Let z = , and we have F (o, C) go 0 0 (x)-= an equation which gives C in functions of x. For example; letj (x)2X9-, and we have 2 and integrating, Mr. HERSCHEL on various points of Analysis. 459 X 2{C + } Now, if we make u0 =x xwe get C=X+ + 2 and consequently, (X) X + %/ r 1 2 + -1)V5. If we suppose 0 (x, y) to denote any function of x and y, and conceive this expression substituted for x, as follows; (PB (xty)ty V we shall have the second partzialfiaucton, taken with respect to x, which we tnay denote thus, 02' (x,y). If we repeat, or conceive repeated, this operation m times, we shall have the mth partial function with respect to x: mmX (Xy) A p tm I) (Xsy) A } If the mth partial function with respect to x be in like manner successively substituted n times for y in the expression 5 (x,y), we shall obtain a result, vmln IXy >AE?mnl(,2 and so on for more variables, z, w, &c.-. An equation containing any number of the successive orders qY (x) x, q (x), * . . . A W), of a function A, and from which v is to be deter, mined, is called a functional equation of the nth order, in ?. Thus the equation 0= (x)-( i + b) . p.(x) + bx is a functional equation of the second order, and is satisfied by the following 9 (x) = a + bx. 46o Mr. HERSCHEL on various points of Analysis. An equation between any number of the partial functions Pmtn&c (X, y) z, &c) for determining the form of p (xy, z, &c) is called an equation of partial functions, and its order may be denoted in the same manner. Thus o = ' (X) + P" (xy) -(a + b + ) c (xy y) + c is an equation of partial functions of the second order with two variables, and is satisfied by the equation (Xy) ==ax + by + c Let (x) be a function of x, and a certain number of constants a, b, c,... And from this expression conceive Oa (x), P (x) &c to be successively formed which will be functions also of a, b, &c. If the number of these constants be n, we may thus produce X + i such functions of them, which will be respectively equal to the several orders of p which they represent. Thus we have n + i equations involving the n quantities a, b, c, &c which may therefore be eliminated, and the resulting equation between x, (p (X), qo (*x) &c will therefore be independent onthem. As far then as regards this equation they are arbitrary, so that in reascending from a functional equation which contains n + i different orders of n (not including p (x) or x) n arbitrary constants must be introduced. The reasoning here made use of is sufficiently plausible, and in fact, no other than has boen adduced in de" monstratioh of well known and important truths. The con. clusion too, to the extent of its literal meaning, is correct. But we have here to notice a paradox of a very singular nature, viz: that even in the simplest cases imaginable (such as p (x) = x) the general expression for q (x) may contain, not one or two, but an unlimited nuaLter of arbitrary constants, nay Mr. HERSCHEL on various points of _nalysis. 461 even one or more arbitrary functions. A nearer attention to every step of the above reasoning will explain this paradox. But what has been said will serve to make us cautious in trusting implicitly to all its other applications. Problem Io To determine e (x) from the equation p2 (x) x. Assume z a function of x, and u a functional characteristic, which shall satisfy the following conditions XUZy (x) =UX I From these, we obtain p (x), that is, p (uz) or (pzt )--u+X; . . . . . . .(a) and if (x) or q {d (x)} -(u)g+l = uz; . . . .

Now by cross-multiplication of the equations (a) and (b) we find, 2 + I *( )z+I38x*( )z Thus the function uX.

The subsidiary function z, and the characteristic u are not then necessary to be known but as a matter of curiosity. They may however be found when p is determined, by the resolution of the equation of differences ? (u,) = w hich gives the form of the function u, in z, and z is given by the equation x= or z -= u (X)4 Aliter. Assume as before, x = u, q (x) = then we lhave tp( l) ~ 2=:>0 **** .**(d). Now, x u therefore 5 (x) = 9 (u.), that is, U q5 (U and for z writing z -t , u= which being substituted in (d) gives p (uz+1) = .

This method applies also to the more general equation O (x) =f (x), by the substitutionsf (x) u., (x) =z+ but, owing to the transcendental equations it it troduces, must be regarded as totally ineffectual and useless. Prob. II. Given pn (x) =f (x). Required at least one satisfactory value of p (x).

This example depends on the integration of an equation of differences of the form o _uz+ .

To take an instance of the application of these equations to geometrical problems, let AM be an hyperh bola whose axis is CP and ....... centre C, and let it be required to find a curve am such that drawing the ordinate PMm, making Cd ______{ Pm and again erecting dl d P parallel to PM, if this be repeated n times the last ordinatefk shall be equal to PM.
