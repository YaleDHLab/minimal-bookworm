L 217 J XV. Of the construction of Logarithmic Tables. By Thomas Knight, Esq. Communicated by Taylor Combe, Esq. Sec. R. S. Read February 27, i8i7. 1. 1 HAVE endeavoured, in this short Paper, to give a simple and connected theory of the construction of logarithms, which I think has not hitherto been done. PRoP. I. To find the Logarithm of i + x.* It is not difficult to see that we may assume L ( i 4 ) 'Ax + "Ax' + "1Ax3 + ""Ax + &c., whence ,L (i + y) -'Ay + /'Ay3 + "'Ay3 4 ""'Ay4 + &c., and L {(i+x) ('+y)}-L(i+4x+y+xy), or putting 1+x_=r, { (+ )y_'A(x+,ry)+t'A(x5+,ry)9, "A(x+.7ry)3+& If we substitute these three expansions in the equation L(i +x) L(i y)-L{ (t1 x) (a y)} which expresses the nature of logarithms, and compare the coefficients of the first power of y, we find 'A = 'Ar + 2"Arv + 3S"AirH + 4""Ar 4. &c. or 'A = 'A + 2"Ax + 3"/Ax2 4. 4"11`Aa3 + &c. + 'Al +42"AJ + 3"Aj whence, by comparing the coefficients of the powers of A, 'A='A, 2,"A4'A=o,c3"'A+4. 1A o, 4"/A+43.'A=o, &c.; or 'A ~~2A'A 3A/IAA__A A_ 'A A=-Wz, tA) "'A__2 A= A OPERA_ 3 A &c. 2 ~~3 3' 4 * Ifind that the method of expansion made use of in this Proposition had been previously employed by Mr. SP E x cE.F fX 2 1 8 MMr. KNIGHT O7a the constructi-on and L(ic, ='A {? 3 4 + I 2 ~3 1 As for 'A it may be evidently taken at pleasure; and innumerable systems of logarithms may be formed by assigning different values to it, for 'AL(i+x)+'AL(,i+y)='AL(@+xI)( ily)} which expresses that, if every logarithm in a system be multiplied by the same constant quantity, the products will -still form a system of logarithms to the same numbers. Cor. By an easy transformation of L (i + x), we get for BRIGG'S logarithms, M being the modulus, aZ m a-b I ab3 I ad-b 5 L-M +-(S)l4.(I)+} and when. o b-M a+b +3 Cib] + 5 ta+bl 3tadwe ever the logarithm of a fraction is spoken of in the following proposition, it is supposed to be found by this series. 2. How are we to begin, in forming a table of logarithms ? DELAMBRE (Preface to BORDA, P. 75) says, that we should begin at ioooo; and the same writer (Memoires de l'lnstitut, Tome cinq. p. 65), speaking of the great French Tables, says that the logarithms of primes under iomooo were calculated directly by series, and those of numbers above 1oooo by six orders of differences. Now it is not easy to see, why any of the logarithms in the lower half of the Table, except those of the numbers 2 and 3, should be computed directly; since they may be got, each by a single subtraction, from those in the upper half. Suppose, for instance, there had been found directly the logarithms of numbers from ioo,ooo to 200,000; those of numbers down to 3oooo are found by merely subtracting the logoa rithm of 2, successively, from those of all the even numbers; f Loganthmic Tables. 91 beginning at the topof theTable, withLi. 9998,L 1999996, &c. and setting down the remainder for the logarithms of the' successive numbers belowv tooooo, viz. L. 9999g , L. 99998, &c. When wve have got down to oooo, if we were to proceed in the same way, we should have to operate on the logarithms thus obtained, between iooooo and 50,000: If, therefore, we fear any, accumulation of errors, we may (because 3x49999 149997) subtract the logarithm of q from L. 149997, and from the logarithm of every third number going downward, and set the remainders down successively for the logarithms of numbers below 5oooo. And thus we may proceed till we get somewhat below 3,ooo; then the logarithm of 4 Will carry us down to 50,ooo; and the logarithm of to 20oooo, which completes the work, those below 20,000 having been already found, In the great French Tables, however, it has been thought proper to calculate the logarithms of numbers under io,ooo vwith more decimal places than the rest. These must necessarily be found independently of the others; as they form in reality a separate Table. In the next proposition, Is contained a general method of finding converging series for the calculation of logarithms. The propositions which follow this are only corollaries from it, and give forms for interpolation ; so that every thing relate. ing to the construction of logarithms is effected by one simple and uniform process. Mr. KNIGHT Onthe c nstruction PROP. II. . To express a number (x) by the product of a series of fractions con erging continually towards unity. Let n, at, it", &c. be numbers much less than x, in the equation x-,W change a, in the second member, into + n, and mnultiply by such a factor as will restore the equality; there arises (x + n) x If, in the second member x+ n of this equation, we change xv into x + ni', in the last factor Z and multiply by such a fractional factor as shall again restore the equality, we have x+n x( ?+n'v) I (X + n ) x-+n-J n (X+n)( v+n If here, in like manner, we change x into x+n" in the last factor, and restore the equality as before, by annexing a new factor, then x+W (x+n) (xin+d~n") =(, +n) x Ax + X(x++nn) x+n+n*)( +X+f) (a+n(x + t )( nf( + no Jr i+ mynk (x+n)(x+n')x+n0)(x+n+'+ie) and the same process may be repeated as long as we think it necessary. Now it is plain that the last annexed factor, as wve continue these operations, must always approach nearer to unity than that which was the last before ; thus, n being very msall compared with x, does not much differ from unity, and when x+nt is put for x in this fraction (at being also very small compared with x) its value will be nearly the same as before : of course the annexed factor (X+ r +nlg will difer very little from unity: and it will differ from it of Logarthzmic Tabless SAl much less than the preceding factor for let = ie-U, i.-2, and pt and [L being small fractions; the new fatrx(x+n+n,) I-P factor I (+n)(x+7')-[-b,1 -(p,-fZ) nearly: and consequently differs less from unity than the factor which was last before. 4. These equations, being put into logarithms, give a series of converging expressions for the logarithm of x. We have successively, ist. La.t=L(x+n)+L( ) d L .L.-L(x +f) + L(x + n)-L(X +n +n+ ') + L X10+0 xt +(n+n')xznnI but before we put the third equation into logarithms, it will be better to simplify it ; one -of the most obvious ways of doing which is to make n+n'-n" then 3d. L.x=L(x+n)+L(+n.') +L x+ 2" g ... L(x+n+n") -L(x+nt+n9 + L (5+3n!~x1+(nnl+2nftUx xs +3nie+(nan' +2n'*) This may be still farther simplified by making n=n', consequently nfl"2fl, then L.x-2L.(x+ n>)-2L(x+3n) +L(X+4n) x3 + 6nxl + gn~x + 4n3 If now we change n into -,1 and x into x+2, we shall fall upon the elegant formula of Mr. BORDA.* * If any one shall attempt to calculate a Table of logarithms by means of differences, each logarithm being got, -not from the next, but from the next but one below it, he will fall upon the series of BoRDA: for Af . L(x-0 )= L. (X+2) -3L(x+ ')+ 3L .x-L(x,-I), A.L(x-z)L(x+l )-3L.x+ 3L(x-1)-L(x-2), by adding which, AT. L (x-I )+ A&. L(xw-)zL (x+ I "4}) which gives the series we are 1peaking of. This remark will be exemplified ina one of the follioing Propositions. 222 Mr. KNIGHT on the construct on In like manner we might investigate approximations of the fourth and following orders: but this kind of research has very little use, and the Proposition was inserted for a different purpose.
