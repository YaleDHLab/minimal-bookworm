The Undertakings of Mr. Henry Bond Senior, a famous Teacher of the art of Navigation in London, concerning the Variation of the Variation of the Magnetical compass and the inclination of the Inclinatory Needle; as the Result and Conclusion of 38. years Magnetical Study. THE said Mr. Bond can shew the Cause of the Variation of the Variation of the Magnetical Needle or Compass by the Motion of two Magnetical Poles; how these Poles are found; and what their Distance is from the Poles of the Earth; what their Annual Motion is, and from whence it proceeds. By Calculation he finds all the Variations that have been observed at or near London for above 90 years past, and so by consequence it may be found at London to the end of the World. He hath calculated a Table to every five minutes of the Inclination of the Inclinatory Needle; so that by the Needles Incli(6066) Inclination, and that Table, and the Latitude of the place, he can find the Longitude of any place in world. By that Table also he finds Mr. Rob. Normans Inclination, which he found A. 1576; and can shew,what will be the greatest and least Inclination of the Inclinatory Needle in any Latitude in the world. He hath four Examples of finding the Longitude by the help of the Inclinatory Needle; one at Balsora in East-India in the year 1657. Another at Cape Charles, on the coast of Virginia before that time. The third, at the Cape of Good Hope. The fourth, at the Straights of Magellan. So far He: who, 'tis hoped, will shortly by the generosity of some Noble Virtuoso or other, recompensing his studies and pains, be induced to discover to others this his knowledg.
