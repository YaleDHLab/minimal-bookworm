To The RIGHT HONORABLE FULKE LORD BROOKE Of Beauchamp's=Court. MY LORD; HAving Compleated the fifteenth Volume of the Philosophical Transactions, (which contains part of the great Stock of Experimental Learning, communicated to the Royal Society the last year,) I now Humbly Dedicate it to Your Lordship; a Person of Honor, always ready to Favor, whatever makes for the Improvement of Knowlege,and the Public Good. But this imperfect Character of Your Lordship, tho' of it self sufficient to Justify the present Address, is not the only Inducement to it: I could mention, how much We are all indebted to Your Lordship, for a Uniform and Steddy Loyalty to the King, and a Pious Love for Your Country: I I might add, That Your Lordship's Kindness has reacht the Publisher of these Tracts, and made Him wholly Your Own: But I must take care, not to be Uneasy to Your Lordship; who is more inclined to Do great things, then to Hear of them after they are done. Wherefore, I shall only recommend to Your Lordship's Patronage and Protection, the following Discourses: Some of which retreive lost Peices of Antiquity, (as the Incombustible Cloth, &c.) and by these means add to the Authority of the Antients, who have suffered in their Reputation by Our Ignorance: Others extend the bounds of Learning, and inform Mankind by New Discoveryes: These are all presented to Your Lordship, in token of a much greater Debt, from, MY LORD, Your Lordship's most Obedient Humble Servant, WILLIAM MUSGRAVE, Reg. Soc. Sec. [835] Numb. 167. Beginning the fiveteenth Volume. PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS. Jan. 28th. 1684/5. The CONTENTS. 1.
