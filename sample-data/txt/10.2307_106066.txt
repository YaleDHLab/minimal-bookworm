[476] XXXV April 21, 1772. Experiments on two Dipping Needles, which DippingNeedles were made agreeable to a Plan of the Reverend Mr. Mitchell, F. R. S. Rector of Thornhill in Yorkshire, and executed for the Board of Longitude, by Mr. Edward Nairne, of Cornhill, London. THE magnetic needles were twelve inches long, and their axes (the ends of which were of gold allayed with copper) rested on friction-wheels of four inches diameter, each end on two friction-wheels, which wheels were balanced with great care. The ends of the axes of the friction-wheels were likewise of gold allayed with copper, and moved in small holes made in bell-metal; and opposite the ends of the axes of the needles, and the friction-wheels, were flat agates, finely polished. Each magnetic needle vibrated in a circle of bell-metal, divided into degrees and halfdegrees, and a line passing through the middle of the needle to the ends pointed to the divisions. The minutes set down in the experiments were, by estimation, as the third of half a degree is counted ten minutes. The instruments were carefully placed, so that the needles vibrated exactly in the magnetic meridian. Read July 9, 1772.

The two needles were nearly balanced before they were made magnetical; but, by a curious contrivance of the Reverend Mr. Mitchell of a cross fixed on the axes of the needles (on the arms of which were cut very fine screws, to receive small buttons, that might be screwed nearer or farther from the axis), the needles could be adjusted both ways, to a great nicety, after they were made magnetical, by reversing the poles, and changing the sides of the needle.

It was between 8 or 9 minutes before the vibration ceased. The needle brought to an horizontal position, and one grain and a half laid on the extremity of the South end, was not sufficient to keep it in an horizontal position; but the North end pointed to 35~ 30~. One grain and three quarters laid on the extremity of the South end of the needle, was more than sufficient to keep it in an horizontal position, the South end then pointing 6~ 45~ below 0.
