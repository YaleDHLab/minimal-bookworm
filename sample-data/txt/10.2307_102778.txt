A Letter from Mr Charles King to Mr Sam. Doudy, F. R. S. concerning Crabs Eyes. Little Wirley, Decemb. 14. S I R, I Cannot give you any satisfactory account of the Stones in the Heads of Craw-fish, for I never made any observations but casually, and without any design of a particular account of them, having not so much as made any note of the months that they first appear, and what time they grow to perfection. I only remember in general, that they are always on the outside of the Stomach, while the old Coat sticks on the back of the Fish, and pass into the Stomach as soon as they cast their Coats, having never seen them on the outside when they have changed, nor within before. And I also remember the Males change their Coats a considerable time before the Females, for they always keep theirs till they have parted with their young (673) young from their Tails. I do not remember that I ever observed any thing of them but what a good and full account is given of in a Book entituled Gammarologia, of Phil. Jac. Sachs shewed me by Dr Plot; if upon perusal of that Book, any thing occurs that you desire farther satisfaction in, I shall be ready to give you the best information I can, if you send any Queries to Your Humble Servant, Ch. King. IV.
