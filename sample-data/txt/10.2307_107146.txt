'I 219 J X. On the Integration of certain dtfferential Expressions, wii whicb Problems in physical Astronomy are connected, &c. By Robert Woodhouse,i A. M. F. R. S. Fellow of Qius College. Read April X1 810o4. IN analytical investigation, two important objects present them-c selves: the concise and unambiguous expression of the condi.. -~~~~~~~~ tions of a problem in algebraic language; and the reduction of such expression into forms commxiodious for arithmetical computation. If the introduction of the new calculi, as they have been called, has extended the bounds of science, it has enormously increased its difficulties, in their number and magnitude. The differential forms that can be completely integrated, occur in few problems only, and those of small moment. In physical astronomy, the investigations give rise to, differential expressions, which call forth all the resources of the analytic art, even for their approximate integration. For the integration of differential expressions that, by the process of taking the differential, can be derived from no finite algebraic form, recourse is had to infinite series: thus, if the expression be dx .f x, and there is no quantity Fx, such that dx .fx =-d (Fx) : fx is put =f((x a) + a) -f (x -a)a +Df (x-a)-a + Df (Xa) a, + &C. and fdx .fx fdx f (x-a) +fdx .Df (x--a) J Jdx. DJ fXa) &c. or, 220 M-. WOODHOUSE onI the Integration puttingfx =f (a + x -a), the integral of dx .fx is calculated from the series fdx .fa . (x a) +fdx,. Dfa . (x a) + &c. But, although the integrals of many expressions can thus. be, exhibited, yet such series are useless for the purpose of arithmetical computation, except their terms continually decrease, and except the limits of the ratio of the decrease of the terms can be determined; and the invention of series adapted to arithmetical computation, has not been the least of the difficulties encountered by modern analysts. Although the differential expressions that admnit no finite integration have not been reduced into classes, yet there are some, from their simplicity and frequent occurrence in analytical investigation, more conspicuously known and attentively considx dx dered: such are the expressions -x, and the computation of their integrals, in other words, is the determination of the logarithms of numbers, and the lengths of circular arcs. The necessity of calculating the integrals of expressions 'such dx dx as -T+' V('2)' must soon have obtruded itself on the attention dx dx of the early analysts: for several expressions, as _&c. apparently dissimilar, are easily reduced d dx to the forms ; and besides, the difficulty of inteI +S V1-X grating a variety of forms, is soon reduced to that of the integraedx dx dx tion ofd, Vix, such, for instance, are the formsdx, x)' dx d and all that are comprehended under d _ ; a dx~ xl~dx the forms (x V(x-dxi)' &c. and all that are comprehended Xuer m dx under (I laze)* of certain dfferential Expressions, &c. e.1 It is on the grounds of convenience of calculation, and of systematic arrangement, that differential expressions, such as have been just exhibited, are resolved into a series of terms dx Pdx + P dx + Podx + &c. + Q v .+ .,, where Pdx + P'dx, P1'dx are integrable; for, remove those grounds, and it will be tat+ I tSn + 3 em+ 5 difficult to assign a reason why * ' + x * 2 + 2f+ ' + &c. is not an integral of At x equally exact as , d (2zm-i) 2m-3_ 3 (zrn-i) (-3) !in Z2 (2m-z) -.rn 2n-4) (zm-z) xtm5 +&C.} + 3 a /Q-s) In the application of the differential calculus to curve lines, after making certain arbitrary assumptions, it appears that hyperbolic areas, and arcs of circles, may be computed from the integrals of the expressions dx dx ; the integrals of which are in fact afforded by the several methods that relate to the quadratures of the circle and hyperbola; and mathematicians, either for the sake of embodying in some degree their speculations, or from a notion of a necessary connexion subsisting between circles, hyperbolas, and the integrals of dx dx have expressed the integrals by the arcs and areas of those figures. Although the computation of the integrals, is totally independent of the existence of the figures, and of their properties, yet it is curious, that the simplest transcendental expressions of analysis, should express parts of the simplest figures in geometry. + This series arises from expanding --i, and from integrating each term mul4ied irnto dm dx Mr. WOODnOUsE on tbe Integration In analytical investigation, after dthe tra scendental expression, next, in point of simplicity, is dx i/ ( ' ;* in a particular application, this differential represents the arc of an ellipset a figure, next, in point of Sim plicity, to the circle. Many differential expressions depending, for their integration, on the integral of dx /( 1e ),it became necessary to exhibit it, for all values of x and e. A problem in consequence arose, of no small difficulty, named, analogously to the naming of the rectification of the ellipse. In the prosecution oG the researches to which this problem led,it was discovered that the hlyperbola might be rectified by means of the ellipse, or, to speak correctly, and without the employment of figurative language, it was discovered that the transcendental expression dx %/ ( x 1zi' ) (e 7 1) might be mad.e to depend, for its integration, on that of dx ( I ) e -v i. The integration of dx / does not depend more on the iength of an ellipse, than it does, on the time of the vibration of a pendulum in a circular arc, or on the attraction of a sphe. roid; but, in each of these problems, it occurs as an analytical phrase, an expression in symbolical language, the exact meaning of which it is necessary to know. If the Imeaning be determined for one case, it is for all three; and hence, with the rectification of dx', d ' 7(' 2)-( z 2) is as simple an expression: they are considered together in -VO(-x') (i-e2 x1) the following pages. I The ellipse admits of an easy mechanical description; and, considered as a section of the cone, was admitted by the ancient geometricians into plane geometry. of certain djyerential Expressions, &c. the ellipse, a problem by itself unimportant, the solutions of other problems, are intimately connected; and, with this object in view, the determination of the length of a curve line, mathematicians have enriched analysis with several curious artifices, and valuable methods. To determine the integrals of , dx%/ ( Ij),it is necessary to expand them into series. The difficulty is, to expand them into series that converge: the determination of the integral of dx ought to precede that of dx / ('_<) indeedin most of the series that represent the la7tter, is involved as a term, and is supposed to be known. The determination of each integral presents a curious circumstance, in the correspondence of certain geometrical properties and analytical artifices; for instance, the theorem for the tangent of the sum of two circular arcs, affords, analytically, a means of computing the length of the arc and, conversely, the analytical artifice * by which the integral of sdx whichthe itegra o,/-,)is computed; translatedleads to therdx * The method of deducing the value of between the values of x, o and x, independently of any reference to a circle, is as follows. dX due' du' fdx d_ rdu"__ Let + 2 then ( ) u") V/ IV('U +C, and, expressing the Integrals by their exponential expressions, we may deduce (see Phil.

G g e24 Mr. WooDHOUSE on the Integratioi properties of the sines, and tangents, of circular arcs. Again,FAGNANI'S theorem, by which a right line is assigned equal to the difference of two elliptic arcs, affords a method of arithmetically computing the length of the ellipse and, conversely the analytical artifice by which the integral of dx/ (ie) is computed; translated into geometrical language, becomes FAGNANI'S theorem. And again, the analytical resolution of fdx ./ (Ifr) into Au' + Bit" + PfdutI ('jJ) + Q~~t lU, (here theintegral, on accu Qf-du ~ p(where the 'integrals, on account of theno -va) (contained between the values of v, o and -2 which latter series, from the smallness of v, V', converge with considerable rapidity; or the latter part thus, putv Z v ' G = then y an' f?, f~dz' j I~zzeJI+z~z I Now ,if U' ,y 1, V2 I fT V v Z = Coseuetl, th i tega Consequently, the integral of --(between the values of y, o and 3) 1+y Cdz 'between the values of z, o and 1 b (between the values of z', o and 3) and consequentlynj (between o and x) z { 2+ 5 -&c. } + J { +s -&c. } which is, in fact, E UL ER'S method of determining the periphery of a circle.

Hence it appears, that there are two different methods by which the analytic art may be advanced; either by artifices peculiarly its own, or by aid drawn from the properties of figures and curve lines if, for instance, FAGNANI'S theorem be proved for an ellipse, by processes purely geometrical, then, such a theorem, expressed in analytical language, becomes immediately a means of computing the integral of dx v/ ' ; or if, by reasonings strictly geometrical, a relation can be established between the arcs of three ellipses, whose excentricities vary according to a certain law, then, by expressing such a relation in the signs of algebra, the integral of dx J ( A ) may be computed by means of the integrals of du,' 4 ('?? ),and of dull| ( l , which integrals can be found more readily than the original integral, by reason of the quicker convergency of the series into which the differential expressions may be expanded, e and el' being less than e. One main olject of the present paper is, to exhibit the integral of dx / ('7% ) for all values of e, and to reduce other integrals to it. Much has been already done on this subject. The researches of mathematicians on the length and comparison of elliptic arcs, are extended over the surface of many memoirs ; yet I hope to have something to add in point of invention, and more in point of arrangement and simplicity of expression. The labours of future students will surely be lessened, if it be Gg2 226 Mr. WOODHOUSE on the Integration shown, that several methods, apparently, distinct and dissimilar, because expressed in different language, are fundamentally, and in principle, the same. The simplest mode, and the first that occurred to mathematicians,of finding the value offdx/ ( ' A) was, to expand the differential expression into a series of terms ascending by the powers of e, and to take the integral of each term. This method, however, is very imperfect; for, if e be nearly = 1, the series converges so slowly as to be unfit, or at least very incommodious, for arithmetical computation. It became necessary then to possess a series ascending by the powers of i e*; and such a series was first given by EULER, in his Opuscula, published at Berlin in 1750; and it must be manifest, that there can be no one single series, ascending by the powers of e, or by powers of the same function e, that can in all cases represent its value. I purpose to consider the several series that represent the value of fdxl ( '7 zi) when e is small, when e is nearly = i, or, when V(i-e) is small when e is L V/(1-en) and ia when e is > V(-1ee2) and > when e and v/(i -en are equal, or when each equals a_. The series for the first and second cases, I shall deduce, because I wish to consider the subject in its fullest extent; but those serieswhen we regard practical commodiousness, are superseded by the methods by which thefdx I( l7e) X1 is to be found, in the third and fourth cases. Two methods then, are only requisite for finding the integral in all the values of e; for the integral of certain differential Expressions &c. 227 in the last case may be found, with nearly equal convenience, by either of the methods in the two preceding cases. For the sake of conciseness, I employ the symbol D to denote the numeral coefficients of the terms arising from the expansion of (i x)0; thus, Dl" signifies m; D2 1m, m .mI; 1l2 i, C rn * r-i 11 im, rn.

This memoir of EULER (Animadversiones in RectqfcationemEllipseos) is curious, on account of the strange artifices used to obtain the series for the length of the eccentric ellipse. It is cha-. racteristical of the peculiar mathematical powers of EULER, and also bears strong marks of the rapidity and eagerness with which he conducted every work of calculation. The author discovers the series and its law, partly by tentative methods, and partly by the use of a differential equation of the second order; and indeed, without the use of such an equation, it is difficult to exhibit the law.

But it also appears, that the property of the bisection of the ellipse, established geometrically, ought not to be regarded as a merely curious and beautiful property, since, by its aid, the length of the elliptic quadrant may be computed. Several other properties, considered hitherto in the light of curious and speculative truths, translated, would appear analytical artifices, and in computation practically useful. By the preceding series, the integral of dx >/ ( i ,6 ' t) imay be computed when e is nearly o or 1. It is necessary, however to possess a method of computing the integral when e is of mean value; and the methods I am about to exhibit, are such as to supersede the useof the two series ascending by the powers of e and b in other words, from two similar mnethods, in all values of e between o and 1, the integral may be commodiously computed. The principle of the method is this, if df = dx ( then, " This theorem of FAGNANi has lately been very neatly demonstrated, by a most skilful mathematician, Mr. BRINKLEY, in the Trish Transactions, by a geometrical pros cess, Abut not without the use of prime and ultimate ratios. Indeed, the nature of the subject is such, that the theorem cannot be established, without thel use of the fluxsonarv calculus, or of some calculus equivalent to it. 238 Mr. WooDiuousn on the Integration df', df", df"', &c. being similar differential expressions, df may be resolved into md P + M df'+ f . df", (dP being a perfect differential, mn, ,, , &c. constant coefficients,) in like manner, df' may be resolved into mnldP'+cz . df"+' '. df" into mM'ddP+'J'+z. df"'+ A". dfJv, &c. and, consequently, df may be resolved into m.dP+am' . dP'+ L c' ml mi" dP" + &c. +a lal/a/11 &c. df" &c. + 8C.

Here may again be remarked, the connexion between the artifices of computation and the properties of curves; for the series expressing fdx/( i-1e x2) (cteris Paribus) converges more quickly, the less x is; consequently, the whole integral is more commodiously calculated by the theorem f (i )2f (x= ,VlI b)) -i + b, than if x were put i, in the form of the expansion of dxj ( l ,) ; still more commodiously, by the theorem f(1) . 4f(x=a) 2(I --Vb) V(1-1b) (I-A/b)9, where a2== ~1+,bi 1.-AV( + b)} is less than +b) and so on1. It has been already observed, that the methods of determining f, bx Of', andf", or byf',f",f"', or byfjf"', &c. as LEGENDRE has done, or by the regular form which the indefinite reduction of , into (Pr -), PI), assumes, are, aufond, the same methods and I purpose now to show that the substitution, which is to be considered cs the base and principle of the method, is the same,, although dife qf certain differeitia1 Expressions, &c. 257 ferently expressed, in the methods of LEGENDRE,, of Mr. IvonY, and of Mr. WALLACE, Who have learnedly and ingeniously written on this subject.

A. Of this substitution of u' for /[g+bx_) and of the transformation ofdxl (dJ?L into Adu'+dx'v/(7f b'2,&c. M LAGRANGE is, I believe, the originalauthor. When x is called the sine of an arc 0, dx w (I eA) may be dx dO expressed by~ dO( e? 2 si ), n (i X) (le2X) by V(Izsi so)' LAGRANGE, Fonct. Analyt. p. 90, has treated of the integrals of these expressions; as has LEGENDRE, Mem. de l'Acad. p. 663, and LACROIX, Trtitedu_ Calculudiffi Vol. II. page 454. The results obtained by these authors, may easily be deduced from the substitution of xV( I_ 2 ,. ) = v (' _,4. Some of these results may appear curious a; but I apprehend, what is chiefly necessary for the solutions of problems in physics and., astronomy, into which the expressions ( dxV' ( ) enter, is a method of approximating to their integrals. A certain method of approximating to these integrals, has been given in the preceding pages. In different applications, its expression may be varied; thus, f is transformed into an expression involvingf', f", where f', f", can be more easily computed than f; express this transformation with reference to an ellipse, and it; appears that the length of one ellipse may be estimated, from the lengths of two ellipses of different excentricity. Again, f ( t , ,, an ez in order to be computed, is transformed into of certain dfeentiat Expressions, &c. 259 x~~~~e' fdu ___________~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~e'-(i+ " du or into (l+e') (X+e") Hdu"; z eV I / U_ Z) (,I e' 12) 2 * 2 i-o &-c. butiv(1 XZ) ( .

A certain method, for computing the integral of dx >/ ( I-e X (df) being obtained, in a systematic treatise, the next business of the analyst would be, to show what differential forms depended for their integration on that of df. Such differential forms are many; and, by the introductionof geometrical language, with considerable embarrassment to the comnputist, varied in their expression. dx_____ dx -b-----z , do *v(l+ mdcos. 8), cos. nO. d.

Amongst these, dxl' U A ) merits some attention. In an analytical point of view, there is nothing curious or remarkable in the reduction of such a form to dx / <' ), and other quantities that can be integrated; but, with certain conditions, fdx J -represents the arc of an hyperbola ; consequently, announcing the analytical result in geometrical language, the hyperbola may be 260 Mr. WOODHOUSE on the Integration rectified by means of an ellipse; which property is to be reckoned curious, I conceive, because the ellipse and hyperbola are sections of the same solid cone; for, otherwise, I do not perceive why it is mnore curious, that an hyperbola should be rectified by means of an ellipse, than that any other curve, whose arc F, (F an integral dependent on fdx I/ ( '7 ,) ) should be rectified by means of an ellipse.

This great mathematician has 2m+L also solved the problem of the expansion of (a2+ -b -2b+cos 6) 1; he determines A and B, when the index 2f+I = in which case, the series for A and B, with respect to its numerical coefficients, decreases the fastest.

The method of LAGRANGE, given in the Berlin Acts for 1781, p. 252, has been followed by LAPLACE, Meanique cdeste, p. 268;, and, in that part which relates to the derivation of A, B, from A', B', by LACROIX, Caic. dff -p. 120; and by Mr. WALLACE, Edinb. Transactions, Vol. V. p. 256. But the great difficulty of the pro, blem does not consist in deriving the coefficients from one another, but in computing the value of the first and second; and, for this end, a series that sinmply expresses the expansion of (i e. (Cos. 0)2 ) must be inadequate, at least, it cannot be commodious and general. CLAIRAUT has given a peculiar method for finding A, Mem.. de 1'Acad. 1751) p. 546.D ARBOGAST, Calcul des Derivations, p. 359, 2rn+I' has given a form for the expansion of (I -c. cos.

If' we join together certain parts of LEGENDRE'S Memoir, wesr shall obtaina complete solution of the problem of the expansion of 2M+1 (at~b22ab (cos. L+; for he shows, that' E, the integral of do.

LEGENDRE calls ellipse, because the differential of the arc of an ellipse may be representec by an expression as dOV, ( -ez(cos'. )2) ;-but the problem of the expansion of (a2 +. k2 _2ab cos. O)m requires only the integrals of R-, do.R; the determination of which integrals, is totally independent of ellipses, as it is, of all other curves. That the determination of the coefficients A, B, &c. depended on the integral of RdO, which, in a particular application, represents the arc of a conic section, was known to D'ALEMBERT. In the ?Ichercbes sur djffirens Points importans diu Syskerne duI Monde, page zM zM' 66, he proves that A, B, are respectively equal to 2 , c beBig the semicircumference of a circle, and MI, M', the integrals of dz (a+b cos. z)?2-, and cos. z. dz. (a+b cos z)?, when z which integrals depend, he says, on the rectification of the conic sections; he then adds a remark, which requires some comment and explanation. " Tout se reduit donc 'a trouver par approximation, la rectification d'un arc donn6 dans une section conique; et cest "a quoi on peut parvenir aisdment par diffirentes m6thodes. Mais je ne m'ktendrai pas davantage la-dessus, parce que cette maniere "de trouver les inconnues A et A', me paroit, plus curieuse et plus. "gdometrique que commode pour le calcul . p. 67. D'ALEMBERTI, therefore, rejects a method which has since been adopted: the reason, I presume to be this; if he had attempted to find the coefficients by the rectification of the conic sections, he must have reduced the integrals of dA (a+b.

These observations are, however, digressive; the problem, the expansion of (a'+b'-.2ab. cos I) + , is) I conceive, completely resolved in the preceding pages, whatever be the ratio between the radii of the planets' orbits.* What I have advanced, on a formner occasion, concerning the independence of analysis and geometry, is confirmed by the present reasonings and results. fidx /(5-4A-),f.dl (j),, Jo 2(Z_^) o have been computed, without the introductioi of an ellipse, an hyperbola, an oblique cylinder, or a pendulum * In the case of the new planets Ceres and Pallas, whose mean distances from the surm are nearly equal, the series (8)> and the expression (i +'b) (i +`b) (i +`vb) .,.

For the purposes of classification, however, curves may not be altogether useless. The correspondence that has been shown, between the artifices of calculation and the properties of geometrical figures, may be thought, perhaps, curious or remarkable; and the reduction of several methods into one is, I presume, practically and scientifically useful. On similar reductions, the perfection of analysis, to a great degree, depends: for, a frequent result of a careful investigation is, the discovery that methods apparently different, because differently expressed, are founded on the same principle and fundamental notion; but, if examination and study thus diminish the seeming bulk of our knowledge, they, at the same time, increase an its precision and purity.* See EUER'S Memoir, Novi comm.
