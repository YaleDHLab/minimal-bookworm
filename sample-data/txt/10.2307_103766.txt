II. Observations of the Eclipses of the first Satellite of Jupiter, communicated by his Excellency William Burnet, Esq; Governor of New York, F. R. S. These Observations were made in the Fort of New York, for determining the Longitude of that Place, by us, William Burnet, Cadwallader Colden, James Alexander, and calculated by Cadwallader Colden. The Latitude of the Fort, was formerly determin'd to be 40~ 40~. August the 9th, 1723.

The (165) The Variation of the Magnetick Needle was observ'd, thisYear, to be 7~ 20~ West. Philip Wells, Surveyor General of this Province, in the Year 1686, observ'd it to be 8 ~ 45~; by which, it appears to decrease about 1 ~ 25~ in 38 Years, or a little more than two Minutes in a Year.
