A Way to make Two clear Spirituous Inflammable Liquors, which differ very little in Taste and Smell, and being mixed together, do give a fine Carnation Colour, without either sensible Fermentation or Alteration. Communicated by Monsieur Geoffroy, F. R. S. TO make the first of these Liquors, put a small Handful of dryed red Roses into a Glass Bottle, pour on them rectified Spirit of Wine till it cover them an Inch. Let them infuse in the Cold all together in the Bottle for Four or Five Hours, then pour off the Spirit of Wine, which will be clear and have no Colour. The Second Liquor is made by putting into some good Spirit of Wine some Drops of good Spirit of Vitriol, or Oyl of Sulphur, so that scarce can the Acid or Sour be discovered by the Tongue. If (44) If you put a little of this last Liquor into the first, it will give a fine redish Colour, without making it troubled or causing any other sensible Alteration. If instead of this Wine mixed with Acids, you put to the first some Drops of any volatile Alcali's, as of Spirit of Sal Armoniack,or other,it will give a Green Colour to the Infusion. The Two first mentioned Liquors were brought to a Meeting of the Royal Society by Monsieur Geoffroy, one of their Members, where the first Experiment above-recited being made, it succeeded according to Expectation.
