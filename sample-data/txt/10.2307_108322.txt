L 433 ] XIX. Meteorological Observations made on Board Her MlIajesty's (hired) Bark Pagoda, from January 10 to June 20, 1845, between -20? and -680 Latitude, and 0? and 120? East Longitude. By Lieut. HENRY CLERK, Royal Artillery. Communicated by Lieut.-Colonel SABINE, R.A., For. Sec. R.S., $c. Received April 21, 1846,-Read May 28, 1846. As much interest has been taken of late in the state of the barometer in high southern latitudes, the Expedition sent last year from the Cape of Good Hope to complete the magnetical observations made by Sir JAMES C. Ross in those latitudes, was supplied with a barometer and other meteorological instruments, and directed to make meteorological as well as nmagnetical observations. I have now the honour of laying before the Royal Society the observations made during that Expedition. They were taken daily at the hours of 3 and 9 A.M., 3 and 9 P.M., noon, and midnight, by the officers of the ship during their respective watches. Nothing could exceed the zeal with which the officers entered into all the objects of the Expedition, and the attention and care they took in the observations they had to make. The following are the instruments with which the Expedition was furnished One marine barometer-, Three thermometers, by J. NEWMAN, London. One DANIELL'S hygrometer, Ether in metal bottles. The barometer was of the usual construction, the case being of wood and the scale of ivory read off by a vernier to '01 of an inch; the mercury was contained in a leathern bag. It was compared with the standard barometer at the Magnetic Observatory, Cape of Good Hope, both before and after the Expedition; and also with the Royal Society's barometer on its return to England. The following are the comparisons: Cape of Good Hope.-January 1845. Standard Marin-e ________________ ____________ ________________ _________ M arine below Barometer. Thermometer. Barometer.

They have also been corrected for the effect of temperature on the mercurial column, the corrections being taken from the Table given in the Royal Society's Instructions for Magnetical and Meteorological Observatories, p. 82. The daily means thus corrected are given in the Abstract in Table I. Table 1I. contains the means of every seven successive days; these means have had an additional correction applied to them, for the variation in the length of the column of mercury occasioned by the variation of gravity in different latitudes. 0 = inch. The correction in lat. -20 amounts to -0,059 The correction in lat. -45 amounts to -0-000 The correction in lat. -70 amounts to +0 059 and proportionally for intermediate latitudes. Table III. contains the general results arranged according to latitude. This has been done by grouping together, without reference to date, the weekly means belonging to nearly similar latitudes. The number of observations, of which each general result is the mean, is given in the last column of the Table. In order to resolve the heights of the barometer into the two constituents of aqueous and gaseous pressure, one of DANIELL'S hygrometers was observed at the hours of 9 A.M. and 3 P.M., by Assistant-Surgeon W. DIXON, M.D., attached to the Expedition. The tension of vapoure obtained by these observations is taken from the Table in the Royal Society's Instructions (page 89). This being deducted-from the height of the barometer in rfables II. and III., leaves the pressure of the dry air. IN THE SOUTHERN HEMISPHERE. 433 The thermometers, employed for observing the temperature of the air and of the surface of the sea, were frequently tested by immersing them in melting snow, and the necessary corrections have been applied. The thermometers were found to have very little index error. The temperature of the surface of the sea was obtained by drawing up water in a small canvas bucket and immersing a thermometer immediately into it. The directions of the wind are the true ones, i. e. the observed compass direction corrected for the declination. The force of the wind and the state of weather were recorded according to the system drawn up by Captain BEAUFORT for the use of the Royal Navy:-frequent attempts were made to observe the force of the wind by means of one of LIND'S gauges, but owing to the rolling motion of the ship it was found impossible. The observations in the Pagoda show a lower barometer within the Tropics than a little beyond thenm; the mercury rising from latitude -20? to about 350, where it stood at 3015. From latitude -350 to -560 the barometer fell rapidly, the difference being 1-054 inch. The descent of the mercury with the increase of latitude did not appear to extend beyond -56?, as in the forty days during which the Pagoda was between -60? and -670?5, the mnean height of the barometer scarcely differed from the mean corresponding to 560 21'. The gaseous pressure presents similar features, rising from -200 to -.350, thence descending to -560, and retnaining nearly constant from 56? to -670. The difference between lat. -350 and lat. -560 amounts in this case to 0'78 inch. 'No influence of longitude on the barometer is deducible from these observations extending: from 00 to 1200 East. For the purpose of comparing these results with the inferences which have been derived from previous observations, I have added an abstract of the conclusions drawn from the observations discussed in Dr. ADOLPH ERMAN'S work*, which has been communicated to me by Lieut.-Colonel SABINE. "From a parallel very near the equator, the pressure of the atmosphere, measured by the barometer corrected for gravity, increases both northward and southward to a little beyond the outer limit of the trade winds; beyond this limit the pressure decreases, at first slowly, but much more rapidly after passing the 50th parallel. The maximum of pressure occurs at about 350 in each hemisphere. The decrease from, the maximum in the direction of the Pole has been found in the southern hemisphere to continue as far as the parallel of Cape Horn (-55`5), where the low pressure corresponds with that observed in the northern hemisphere at Kamtchatka and Sitka, which are nearly in the same latitude. "The dry air has also a minimum zone within the inner limits of the trades; the increase from thence in both directions is more rapid and considerable than that of the pressure of the gaseous and aqueous atmospheres united, and the gaseous rnaxi~mum ins both hemispheres is obtained in a higher latitude (about 45?). The pressure * Ueber .Meteorologische Beobaclitungen bei einer Seereise urn die Erde. 436 METEOROLOGICAL OBSE1RVATIONS of the dry air at its maximum at 450 exceeds the equatorial gaseous pressure by about 0(47 inch; the pressure of the whole atmosphere at its maximum in 350 is not more than 0 18 above the equatorial pressure. "The following Table contains the approximate mean annual pressures of the atmosphere corresponding to different latitudes, as given by Dr. ERMAN:--. Of the barometer; 2, of the vapour, and 3, of the dry air. The Table is formed from observations in both hemispheres, and in both the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans; it also unites observations made in different seasons, with a single exception.

On comparing Dr. ERMAN'S conclusions with those drawn from the observations in the Pagoda, it appears that they agree in placing the maximum barometric pressure in lat. 35?, the pressure diminishing thence rapidly to 560, where the Pagoda's observations show it to become nearly stationary; but they differ as to the place of the maximum pressure of the dry air, that being in lat. 400 or 45? by Dr. ERMAN'S observations, and in lat. 350 by those of the Pagoda. It is possible however that a longer series of observations would have miade the present ones agree more closely in this respect also with those of Dr. ERMAN, his means being taken from observations made in different seasons, and in various longitudes in both hemispheres. Taking rom Dr. ERMAN'S table 29-21 as the mean pressure of the dry air at the eqqator, the observations in the Pagoda show a difference of gaseous pressure between the equator and the high latitudes (-56" to670.5) of the southern hemisphere amounting to 0 28 inch; the observations in the Pagoda were however exclusively in the summer months, when the pressures are generally less than on the mean of the whole year. Owing to the increase in the elastic force of the aqueous vapour in the warmer regions of the globe, the difference of barometric pressure between the equator and the high latitudes (taking the data from Dr. ERMAN'S table on the one hand, and from the observations in the Pagoda on the other) amounts to 0(89 inch. As the facts shown by these observations are curious, and must be interesting to meteorologists, it is hoped that the Royal Society will not consider this paper unworthy of their acceptance.
