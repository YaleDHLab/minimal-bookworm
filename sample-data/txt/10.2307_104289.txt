[351] XVI. An Account of a Stone, or Calculus, making its Way out through the Scrotum; communicated by Mr. John Sisley, Surgeon, to Sir Hans Sloane, Bart. Pr. R. S. &c. ONE Robert Swann, of East-Malling, Kent, a hard working Man in the Woods, sent for me one Day to see him. When I came to him, I found him with a large Swelling on his Testicles; on the upper Part of the Scrotum, I found a small Hole or two, and he told me, his Urine oused out sometimes. I passed the Probe in, and found a hard Substance, which seemed to be large: I told him, he had a large Stone lodged there, at which the poor Man was much surprised. I told him, I would make Incision and take it out; he refused to be cut. I dilated it in another Manner, made the Orifice pretty large: The Swelling of his Testicles asswaged, he goes to work, as usual; about a Week's time after, coming home at Night with a large Bundle of Wood at his Back, found himself more in Pain than ordinary; as soon as he got home, complained to his Wife, and told her he was very much in Pain, went to-bed, desired me to be sent for immediately; but before I could get to him, the Stone forced its Way out; and as soon as I came to him, the poor Man seemed much rejoiced, and told me, (as he expressed himself) the Swan had laid an Egg: Its Weight at first was ~ v and ~, now almost four Ounces and three Quarters. This Man lived about seven Years after this, in a good State of Health, and lived to the Age of Threescore or [352] or upwards. He told me, he believed the Stone had been growing there for near thirty Years; but never apprehended it to be a Stone, but used to complain of a Weight, as if it were half a Pound, carried between his Legs.
