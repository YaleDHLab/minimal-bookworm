(2228) II. A Letter from Dr John Harwood, LL. D. and F. R. S. to Dr Hans Sloane, R. S. Sect. concerning the forementioned Hypocaustum.. With Part of two Letters from Mr William Baxter to Dr Harwood, relating to Wroxeter, and the Hypocausta of the Ancients. S I R, The first notice I had of the Hypocaust discover'd at Wroxeter, was from a Letter Mr Baxter communicated to me, which he received from the Reverend Mr Markham, the present worthy Incumbent of that Place; which gave me occasion of making farther enquiry, by writing to the Reverend Mr Richard Lloyd of Salop; who, at my request, was so obliging as to take a Journey and view it: The Remarks he then sent me, being mislaid, I must refer you to Mr Lyster's accurate Model and Description, which I am glad to hear you are about publishing in the Phil. Transactions. I have for some years cherisht an Acquaintance with Mr Lyster, whose Assistance in the late Edition of Camden ought not to have been past over in Silence, but deserv'd a more publick Acknowledgement; sure I am, had it not been for this Worthy Person, the Memory of so remarkable a Piece of Antiquity wou'd in all probability have been lost to Posterity. I think it not impertinent, upon this occasion, that some Account shou'd be given of the Place where it was dis(2229) discover'd, as likewise of the nature or kind of the Antiquity itself: And certainly Wroxeter was one of the most Considerable Military Stations or Colonies the Romans had in this Island; the City Wall, as appears from a Survey taken by Mr Lyster, was not much less than three Miles in Circumference; 'tis not improbable, but that it was founded by Suetonius Paulinus, or after by Agricola, in their March to subdue Mona, now Anglesey: But not to trouble you with my own Conjectures, I send you along with this an Extract out of a Learned Work (which I hope will e're long see the Light,) I mean A Glossarium Antiquitatum Britannicarum, which was transmitted to me, by the obliging Author, my worthy Countryman, Mr Baxter, whose Skill and Knowledge in our British, Roman and Saxon Antiquities, as well as in all other useful Literature, is sufficiently known to you, and the rest of the Learned World. The other Paper I send you, is A Letter I received some time since from the same Worthy Person, in Answer to some Enquiries relating to the Hypocausta of the Antients. Since I did my self the Honour of presenting Mr Lyster's Module to the Society, I have been inform'd by the justlyadmir'd Vitruvius of our Age and Nation, Sir Christ. Wern, that he discover'd the remains of such another Hypocaust, when they were laying the Foundation of the Kings House at Winchester. Mr Christ. Hunter, in a Letter to Dr Lyster, dated May the 15th, 1702. since publisht in the Transactions, gives an Account of an Antiquity of this kind dug up in Yorkshire, as appears from the Description he gives of it, in the Phil. Trans. for the Months of March and April, An. Dom. 1702. Numb. 278. p. 1131. The Ingenious Mr Edward Lhwyd in his useful Additions to Camden, takes notice of another discover'd at Kaer hyn in Caernarvonshire; one of the Hollow Bricks or Tun13 S nels (2230) nels whereof be there describes, and gives a Figure of it, in the Table of the Curiosities added at the end of the Welsh Counties; it occurs Numb. 8. to which I refer you. Mr Camden himself mentions an Hypocaust discover'd at Hope in Flintshire, an Account of which is to be met with in his Britannia, Pag. 688, of the English Edition. You see, Sir, how ready I am to comply with your Commands, and shou'd be glad of any other occasion, of farther approving my self Your Obliged Humble Servant. Mr Baxter's first Letter to Dr Harwood, concerning Wroxeter. I Now transmit to you what I have Written in my Glossarium Antiquitatum Britannicarum concerning Wroxeter.

A second Letter from Mr Baxter to Dr Harwood,concerning the Hypocausta of the Ancients. SIR; THe Ancients had two sorts of Hypocausta; the one called by Cicero,Vaporarium,and by others,Laconicum, or Sudatio, which was a large Sweating Bath. In which were Triavasaria ahena, called Caldarium, Tepidarium,andFrigidarium,from the Water contained in them. The other sort of Hypocaustum is not so distinctly handled by Antiquaries, and it was a sort of a Fornax, or Kill to heat their Winter Parlours, or Coenatiunculoe Hybernae. Erat & Diaeta, sive Coenatiunculoe (Saith Argol upon Panvinius) sub qu~a ignis accendebatur: Unde & Caenatio Hypocaustum. Coenatienes AEstive & Hybernae, are mentioned by Cicero in Epistolis. The Terrace Floor is called by Vitruvius, Testudo. Testudines Alveorum in Coumum Hypocausi calefacientur, saith the same Author. This Hypocausis was called Alveus, and Fornax: And the Man that tended the Fire Fornacator. The Tubuli seems to have been contrived to convey away the smother, that otherwise would choke the Fornacator. Thie kind of Stove seems to be graphi. cally described by P. Statius in Balveo Hetrusci. Ubi (2233) ~Ubi Languidus igms inerrat AEdibus, & tenuem volvunt Hypocansta vaporem. Of the Terrace Argol has these words: Testudines sunt pavimenta sub quibus Fornax ardet. P. S. By the way, I take the word Stove to be derived from AEstus, quasi AEstuvium: there wanting hitherto a probable Etymon.
