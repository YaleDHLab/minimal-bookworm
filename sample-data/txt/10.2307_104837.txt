Abstract of a Letter from Mr. William Arderon, F. R. S. to Mr. Henry Baker, F.R.S. concerning the perpendicular Ascent of Eels. S I R, WHEN I read, some Years ago, what Dr. Plot in his History of Staffordshire relates concerning the Passage of Eels across Meadows, in the Night time, from Pond to Pond, I could hardly forbeat thinking, that the Gentleman there mention'd must by some means or other have been deceived; but what I have lately seen with my own Eyes gives me great Reason to believe his Account to be strictly true. Read Jan. 29. 1746-7. Norwich, July 9. 1746. On the 12th Day of last June, whilst I was viewing the Flood-Gates belonging to the Water-works in this City of Norwich, I beheld a great Number of [396] of Eels sliding up them and the Posts adjacent, notwithstanding they all stood perpendicular to the Horizon, and 5 or 6 Feet above the Surface of the Pool below the Water-works. They ascended these Posts and Gates, until they came into the Dam above: And what makes the Matter appear still more strange, they slid up with the utmost Facility and Readiness; though many of the Boards and Posts were quite dry, and as smooth as a common Plane had left them. I observed, that at first they thrust their Heads, and about half their Bodies, out of the Water, and held them up against the Wood work for some time: I imagine, until they found the glutinous Matter, which is constantly about their Bodies, become sufficiently thick or viscid, by being exposed to the Air, to sustain their Weight: Then would they begin to ascend directly upwards, with as much Ease, seemingly, as if they had been sliding along the level Ground; and thus they continued to do, until they they had got into the Dam above.
