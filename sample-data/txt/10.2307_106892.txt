C 67 3IX. An Account of a Mbethod of measuring the comparative -Intensities of tbe Light emitted by luminous Bodfies. By Lieute nant-General Sir Benjamin Thompson, Count of Rumford5 F. R. S. In two Letters to Sir Joseph Banks, Bart. P. R. S. Read February 6, 1:794. LETTER Ie DEAR STRS ABOUT two years ago, being employed in making a number o:f experiments to determine, if possible, the most oecollomical method of lightirlg up a very large workhouse, or public manufactory,which has been erected in the suburbs of this city under my directions, where the poor, old and young, arld all industrious people who are ill want of work, are employed in a great rrariety of different manufactures, a method occurred to me for measuring the relati^7e quazltities of light etnitted by lamps of diffierent constructions, candles, &c. which ls very simple7 and which I have reason to think perfectly accarate I sent you a rerbal account of this little invention about a year and a half ago, by Dr BSADER, who wrote to me that you seemed to be pleased with it; but as I think it vertr probable, that he might not have been ablFe to give 370U a complete ;dea of the matter from memory, I have determined to senel y)^w short account of it ira writing, which, if you shouicl thir-XX ;¢<rr worthy of that honour, you will be pleased to lay be-fove t3tC ^Royal Society. The method is shortly this : K Z COS}ZZ RUMFORD S ACGOG nD ef a Method oJF8Let the two burning candles, lamps, or other lights to be comparedn A an-d Bn be placed at equal heights upon two light tables) or moveable stands, in a darkened room S letE a sheet of clean white paper be equally spread out, and fasterzed upon the;: wainscotor side of the room, at the same height from the floor witll the lights,-ansl let the li$hts be placed over against this sheet of paper, at the distance of 6 or 8 feet from it7 and 6i or 8 feet from each other, in such a manner, tllat a lin-e drawlaf kom the centre of the paper, perpendicular to its surface, shallt bisect the-angle formed by lines drawn from the lighsts to that centre; in which case, corlsidering the sheet of paper as a plarle speculutn, the o-ne light will be precisely irl the line of reflecti-on of the otheri This may be easily performed, by actually placing a piece of a looking-glass, 6 or 8 inches square, flat upon the paper, irt the midAdle of it, arld observing by means of lt the real lines o£ vreflection of the lights from that plane removing it afterwards as soon as the li-ghtsare properly arranged. When this is done, a small cylinder of srood, about 4 of art lnch in diam-eter, and 6 inches long, mtust be held in a vertical positiorz about 2 or S inches before the centre of the sheet ofv papern and in such a -nanner, that the two $hadourls of the cylinder corresponding to the tmro lights may be distinctly seen; pon tlae paper. If these shadows should befound to be of unequal densitieso which will almost always bethe case, therz that light whose corresponding shadow is tlle densest, must -be removed farthert oR, or the other must be brought nearer to the papera till the densities of the shadows appear to be exactly equal; or in otherwords -till the densities of-the xays from the two lights are t nze>rig the compoaratave Xtensities of Lzgbt.equal v-the surface of the paper; when9 the distances of the . lights ufronl the centre of the paper being measured, the squares of those distances will be 3;o each other as tile real intensitiqes of the lights in question at their sources.: If, for example the. weaker light being placed at the dis tance of + feet from the centre of the papern it shoulcI be found necessary, in order that tlle shadows may be of the same densityf to remove the stronger light to the distance of 8+ feet from that centre, in that casen the real intensity of tlae stronger light will be to thats of the: vveaker as St to 45; or as 64to 6; or 4 to 1 S and -so for any other distances. It is well known-that any quality proseeding from a centre in straight lines in all directions, like the light emitted by a luminous body, its inten-slty at any given distance from that centre will be as the square of that distarlce inversely? arld hence it is clear that the intensities of the lights ln question at tlleir sources, must be to eacll other as the squarxs of their distances from that giv-en point wbere their rays unitzng are Sfound toS he of equal detzsity. For putting x _ the intensity of l3 ; if P represents the point where the rays froln A and frorn B meeting are found to be of equal density or strengths and if the distance of A from P be = m, and the distance of 13from the same poi-nt P = ; tllen, as the ifntensity of the light of A at P is-X5;g and the intensity of the light of B at the same place-Yn2 , and as it is in' = Yz by the supposition, it will be . . . z . t z * v * . m . n That the shadow-s being of equ-al density at any given point? the intensities of the illumlnating rays must of necessity be equal at that point alson is evident from hence, that the total absexlce of light being perfect blacknessS and the shae:low corZ CQ8St RUMFOR9fiS-ACCoUSt of a Method ofresponding to one of the li«ts -in question being deeper or fiinter, according as it is more or less: enlightened by the othery when the shadows are equal, the interlsides of the ilIuminating xays must be equal likewise. . 8 , In removillg the lightsS ill order to bring the shadows to be of the same density, care must be taken to recede firolnJ or advance towards the centre of the pasper in a straight line, so that the orle light may always be found exactly in the-line of reflectionof theother; otherwise the rays from the-diffieren£ lights falling uporl the paper, and conseqllently upon the shadows, at different angles, will render the experiment fallacious When the intensity of one strong light is copared with the intensities of several smaller lights taken together, the smaller lights should be placed in a lille perpendicular to a lineddrawn . 6 to the centre of the papera and as near to each other as possible, and it is likewise-necessary to place them at a:greater distance from the paper than when only single lights are comparee .. In all cases itis absolu tely necessarJr to take the greatest care that the lights compared be properly trimmed arld that they burn clearn and equally, otherwise the results of the ex periments svill be extreluely irregular and inconclusive. It is astonishing what a diffierence tthere is itl the quantities of light elmitted by the same candle, when it burnswith its greatest brilliancy, and .whell it has grown dim for want of snuffing. But as this diminlltion of light is progressives and as the eye insensibly conforms to the quantity of light actually present it is not always taken notlce of by the spectators ;_it is nevertheiess very considerable in fact, as will be apparent to anJ,r one nvllo will talie tEle trouble to make tlae experimellt f and mea3vrtng th-e cotnparati7vetintensilies of ligb¢.'so great is the fluctuation in the quantity of light ernotted by burning bodies, lamps, or candles in a11 cases, even under the rubst fivourable circumstances, that this is the source of tho . . ^greatest difficulties I have lnet with in determinilzg the relative intensities of lig^hts by tlae method here proposed. To ascertain by this method tlwe comparative densities, or intensities of the li-ght of tt1e moonf and of that of: a carldlen tlze moonvs direct rays must be received upon a planes wlhit@ surfacea at an angle of incidence of about 60°, ancl the candIe placed in the line of the reflectiotl of the moon's rays fiom this surfice S when the shadows of the ctrlinder corresponding to the moons light and to that of the candle being brought to le of equa density, by removitlg the candletfarther oK, or . e bringing it nearer to the centre of the white planen as tlle occasion may require the intensity of the lmoons light will beequal to that of the candle at the gzven dzstance xf the candfle Jrom the plane. To ascertain the intensity of the light of the lleavens by day or by nightS this light must-be let into a darkened room through a long tubea blackened on the insiden when its inten sity may be compared with that of a candle or lamp by the nethod above described. . To detertnine tl:e intensity of the direct rays of the sun compared to tlle light emitted by any of our artificial illumi nators it may perhaps be necessaryS considerlrlg the almost inconceivable intensity of the sunvs light, to make use of seae fbrther contrivances and precautions but Iam convincedf however, tllat it may be done, and that even with a very considerable degree of precision. And when the relative inten sity of the sun's light at the surface of the earth compared Count RUMFORD s Sscount of a lVethod ofwith the intensity of the light of a giverl lamp, placed at a given distance, and burrling with a flame of givez dimensions, shalI be known X it will then be easy, from the known size and distance of the slln, to compute the relatirre density of his light at his surface, comparedl to the density of the light of the flame of the lamp -at the surface of that flame. The intensity of the l-ight emitted ill the combustion of iron or of phosphorus in dephIogisticated air, as also tllat of all other burning, or red-hot -bodies, may becotnpared and determined by this method with theS greatest facility and . . exactness. In my next Ietter I shall endeavour to give you an account of th-e result of my inquiries with respect to the best and most oecorlomical method of producing light by candles, lamps7 &c. for comrnon use ; together with a comparative view of tle ex pence of lights of various kinds, the quantity of light produced remaining the same; with such further remarks and observa tions as may occur Munich, I am, &c 20th December, 179Z. LETTER II. DEAR SIR, Since my letter of the 20th December last I have made ma3:ly improvements in the apparatus contrived for meast; ring the: intensity of light, and I have now brought the principal instrument to sucll a degree of perfection, that, if I might without being suspected of affiectation, I should dignify it with nzeasunng Sthe counparalzve Intensties Qf Lzgbt.a namea and call it a phoZometer. I have likewise made a considerable number of new experilnents; btlt before I proceed to gisre an account of thelmf it svill be rlecessary to describe iery particularly the alterations I have foulad it expedierlt to make in the ilastruments. Anda in the first place the shadowsa instead of being thrown upon a paper spread out upon the wainscot or side of tlle roon are now projected upon the inside of tlle back part of a vvooden boxn 74 inches xR7iden log illches -1<3ng and 34 inches deepf in the clear, open ill front to receive the light, and painted black on the itlside in every part except the back upon which the wlaite paper is fastenedL which receives the shadosvs. To the under part of ti<e box is fitted a ball and socket, by which it is attached to a stand which supports it } and the top or lid of it is fitted witll hinges in order that the box may be laid quite open as often as it is necessary to alter any part of the machinery it contains. The front of tlae box is likewise firnis}zed svith a :falling lid or door moveable upon hinges, by uZlaich the box is closed itl iont when it is not in actual 1lse. Findillg it very inconvenient to compare two sAhadows pro jected by the sazue cylinder, as these were either necessarily too far from eacll other to be comparedwithcertaintyor when they were nearer they were irl part hid frona tTle eye by the cylindern to relnedy this inconvenience3 I llOW make use of two cylinders; which being fixed perpendicularly in the bottom of the box just d-escribed in a llrle parallel to tiLle back part of it, distant from this back 2I3O irlchesS and frozn each otlaer S incheSf measuring from the centres of the cylillders S when tlle two lights made use of in the experilnent are properly placed MDCCSCIV. L Count RUMFORD9S AfccounD of a Method ofthese two cylitnders project four shadovvs upon the white paper upon the inside of the back part of the box, wYllicll I shall henceforth call tbe jield of the instrument, two of which shadows are in contact precisely in the middle of that field, and it is these two alone that are to be attended to. To pre4 Wi. vent the attention being distracted by tl:ze presence of u necessary objects, the two outside shadows are made to disappear which is done by rendering the field of-the instrument so narrow, that they -fall withotlt it upon a blackened surface uporl which they are not visible. If the cylinders be eacll I40 of an inch in diameterS arlXl e 20 inches in height, as in the instrument I have lately constructedn it will be quite sufficientS If tlle field be 2-I70 inclles wide ; and as an unnecessary height of the field is not only useless, bllt disadvantageous, as a large surface of vvhite paper not covered by the shadows produces too strong a glare o-f light, the field ought not to be more than I30 of an inch Iligller than the tops of the cylinders. In ord;er to be able to place tlle lights -Xvith facility and pre cision3 a fine bla(>k line is drawn through the rniddle of the field from the top to tll@ bottom of iit, and another (horizontal); line at right angles to it, at the height of the top of the cylin ders. When the tops ofthe shadosvs touch this last-mentioned lirle, the lights are at a proper heigllt and-vvZhen fur ther, the two shadows are in contact with each other in themiddle ofthelSeld, the lights are then in tlleir proper directions. lIn my new-improved instruzuerlt (for I llave already caused -four to be constoleted)the white paper which forms the field is not fastened immediately 1lpon the inside of the back of tlle box, but it is pasted upon a small pane of very fine grourldglassX ancl this glassS thus covered is let down into a groove gmeasuring the compa-rative Inlen3itzes of Light.i 5nade to receive it in the back of the bos. This covered glass is inches long, and as wide a$ t11e box izs deep, viz. S4 inchesX but the field of the instrument is reduced to its proper size by a screen of black pasteboard interposed before the anterior surface of this covered glass, and resting immediately upon it. A hole in this pasteboarcl, in the forrn of an oblollg square, 1 I2O inches wide, and two inches llighn determines the dimensions, and forms the boundarie3 of the fieldl. This screen should be large enough to cover the whole inside of the back of the box, and it may be fixeCl in its place by nzeans of grooves in the sides ofthe box, into which it tnay be luade to enter. The position of the opening above rnentioned is deterlmined by the height of tlle cylinders, the top of it being I3-<,of an inch higher than the tops of the cylinders L and as the height of it is only two inches, while the height of the cylillders is 2I2o inches it is evident that the shadows of the lower parts of tlle cylinders do not enter the field. No incorlvenience arises from that circumstance c on the contraryg severa1 advantages are derived from that ar-rangenent. Instead of the screen just describedn I sometimes make use of another, which diffiers from it only in this, that tlze hole in it} which determines the form and dimensions of the field, in stead of being quadrangularn is round, and 1 I60inches in dia meter. And when this screen is made use of, the shadows are increased in width (by rneans which vill lsereafter be de scribed), oill such a manner as corupletely to fill the field: ap pearing urlder the form of two hexnisphers, or rather half disks, touching eacll other in a vertical lineO 'rhe object I had in viewain reducing the field and the shadows to a circular fortn was this ) I imagirled that by diminishing the number L 2 Count RUMFORD'S Account of a Method of76of oWects capable of acting upon the mind, and particularIy by removing all straight lines and angles, andL all unnecessary varieties of lights and shades, the attention might be concentrated and fixed in such a manner as to render tlae sense of sight peculiarly acute in distinguishirlg any diSerence in the simple objects presented to tlae eye. But holvever plausibIt this reasoning may appear, I own the experiment did not an-swer my expectation. It is true the apparent densities of two equal hemispheres of shade, in contact with each other, may lJe cornpared with great facilityn and when no discernible difference is to be perceived betw@en themS it is more than probable that they are in fact very nearly equal e but still I have found by experielace, that two equal parallelogramsof shade in contact with each otlaer may be compared svitll tlle same easeand, I have reason to thinkn with equal certainty, alad that even when these unitea s5jladovvs are bounded on three sides by a perfectly +vhite surface itluminated by the direct rays of twc:> strong lights r that is to sayn vXthen the screen with tlle quadrangular opening or field is rrlade use of. In describing the cylitaders by whicil the shadows are pro jected, I said they were fixed in the bottom of the box, b11t as tlae diameters of the shadows of the cylinciers vary ln some Ws, stmall ctegreef in proport-ion as the :Tights are broader or narronYern and as they are brought nLearer to or removed fartEler frotn the photometerg ill order to be alble in all cases to brilag t:llese shadosns to be of the sarne diameter, which I have founds by experienceto-be advantageo:usn in order to judge with greater facilityandcertailaty whetl tlle sZ:aadows are of the same densi<y> I have rendered the cylinders moveable about their axes, and have acleled ta each a vertical wi-rlg 2 o of arl inch widen l;Itof measuring the comparatiwe Intensities of Light.7an inch thicl<, and of equal height with the cylinder itself, and firmly fised to it from the top to the bottom. This wing commonly lies in tlae mieldle of the shadow-of t:he-cylinderS and as Iong as it remains in that situatiorl it has no effect whatever S but when it is necessary that the diarneter of one of the shadows be increased, the corresponding cylinder is moved about its axisf till the wing just described emerging out of the shadow, and intercepting a portion of ligllt, brings the shado-Xv projected tlpon the field of the instrument to be of the width or diarneter required. In this operation it is always necessary to turn tlle cylinder--outwardsn or in such a mantler thal: t3:e augmentation of the width of the shadow may take place on tllat side of it which is opposite to the shadow corresponcling to tlie other light. The nEceS3ity for that precaution will appear evident tQ atly one who has a just idea of the instrutnent in question, and of the na-anner of luaking use of it. It is Xby means of these vvings attached to the cylinders that tlle widths of the shaslos are auS.ttnented, so as to fill the whole field of the photometern when the screen with the circular opening-is made use of As tlle lower ends of the cylinders svhich pass through the holes made to receive tlaem in the bottom of the box are about 210 of an inch less in diameter tllall their upper parts which cast the shadows, and as they not only go quite through the bottorn of the box (vvhich is an inch tllick3 but project near an inch belovv its nferior surfacef andn lastly as these cylinders aref not firmly fixed in these holes, it is easy, by taking hold of the enals of them which project below the bottom of ;he box to turn about the cylinders upon their axesn evexl withoaats -78Count RUMFORDSS Accognt of a Method ofopening the box. I said above) that the height of the vertical wing attached to eacll of the cylinders was equal to tlle height of the cylinder itself:-this must be understood to mean, not the total length of the cylinder, comprehending that part of it which passes into, and through tlle lsottom of the box, but merely its height above the bottom of the box, or part projecting, namely 2-I20+inches As it is absoltltely necessary that tile cylinders should constantly remain precisely perpendicular to the bottotn of the tox, or parallel to each other, it will be best to construct them of brass, and instead of fixing theln immediately to the bottom of the box (which being of wood may warp), to fix them to a strong, thick piece of srell hamrnered plate brass, which plate of brass nray be afterwards fastenecl to the bottom of the box by tneaslas of one strorlg screw. In this manner two of my best instruments are corlstructed. AndS in order to senure the cylinders still rnore firmly in tneir vertical positions, they are furnished with broad flat rings9 or projections, where they rest upon the brass plate 9 which rings are IIO of an inch thick, arld equal tn diameter to the projectiorl of tlae wing of the cylinder, to the bottom of which they afford a firm support. These cylinders are likewise forcibly pushed, or rather pulled against the brass plate upon which tlley rest, by means of compressed spiral springsS placed betweerz the under side of that plate and the lower ends of the cylinders. Of whatever material the cylinders be constructed, ancI whatever be their forms or dimensionsS it is absolutely neces$ary that they, as well as every otlaer part of the photometern except the fieldS should be well painted of a deep black, dead colour. That will prevent the inconveniences which would measuring tbe comparative Intensities of Light. 79 otherwisec arise from reflected light, and from the presence of too great a number of visible objects. In -order to move the lights to and from the photometer with greater ease and precision, I have provided two long and narrow., but very strong and steady tables, in the middle of each of which there is a straight groove, in. which.. a sliding carriage, upon which the light is placed, is drawn along by mearls of a cord which is fastened to it before and behind, and which passing over pullie.s at each end of the table, goes-round a cylinder, which cylinder is furnished with a winchS and is so placed near the end of the table adjoining the photometer5. that the observer can turn it about, without taking his eye. f:rom the fieldof the irlstru.merlt. M[any advantages. arJe derived from-this arrangeme.at, asfirst, the observer can move the lights as hefinds necessary w.ithout the. help of an. assistant, and even without removing liis eye from.the..shadows s sec.ondly, each light is a]ways pre-cisely in the line of dire.ction in whic.ll it o.ught to be in order that the shaclows may be-inicontact in the rniddle..of theverti cal plane of the.. photometer X and thirdly, the sliding motion of the. lightsbeing perfectly soft and gentle, that motion produces little. or: no effiect upon the 9 lights themselves, either to increase. or diminish their brilliancy. These tables, which are o inches wide and g5 inches high, and the..one of them 12 -feet, and the. othe.r 20 feet lo.ng, are placed at an angle. o;f 60° from each other, and in such a situat-ion with respect to the photometer that lines.-drawn thro.ugh their middles in the direction of their lengths, mteet in a poirlt vactly under the rniddle of thef vertical plane or field of the CoUnt RUMFORDiS ACCQ#nt f a Method fphotometer, and from that point the distances of the lights are lueasured tlle sides of the tables bein; divided into Englisll inchesn and a Vernier) showing tenths of inches) being fixed to each of the sliding carriages upon which the lights are placed. These carriages are so contrivecl that they can be raised or losrered at pleasure which is absolutely necessary in order thats the lights may be always of a proper heightf namely that they may be in a laorizontal line with the tops of the cylinders of the phototneter. The method of ascertaining when the lights are at the pro?er lleight laas already been described. In order that the two long and llarrow tables or platforms just describedf UpOtl vv7hich the lights move may remain immovea-ble in their proper positions they are both firmly fised to the stand which supports the pllotometer; and in order tllat the motion of the carriages which carry the lights rnay lbe as soft and gentle as possibIea they are made to slide upc)n parallel larass wires g inches asunder about IIO of an inch in dialneter and welI apolishedS which are stretched out upon the tables fforn one end to the other. The pane of glass covered with white paperf which being fixed iil a groove in the back of the box, constitutes the vertical plane upon w}zicll the shadows are proJected is Gg inches long and 34 inches wide as has already beea observed; which is much larger than the ctitnensions asslgne-d above for the field d tlamelyS X I7o inches wideg and 2 inches tiigh. I had ;two objects in view in this arrangetnent; first7 to render it easier to fix thls plane in its proper position e and secondlyf to -be tllzle to augment occasionally t;he dimensions of the fieldn ptesmring the comparative IntexszZies rgLigZ3t. 81 by removing entirely the black pasteboard screen from before th;is plane, or making use of arlother with a larger aperture > which is sometimies advantageous.# Having MOW, :S 1 imaglne, suffltietltly deseribed ail the es sential pa*ts of these itlstrtlments it retuains for tne to give so-me account of the precautions rhich, from experience, I have found it neceswry to talie ila tnaking use of them. And first, with respect to the distance at wlaich liglwts whose illtensities are to be comparel slaould be placed from the field 3f tlle photo-meter, I have found tElat wthen tlae sveakest of the . lights itl question is about as strong as a common wax-candles that ligllt may most advantageously be placed from So to 36 inches from the Gentre of the field; and when it is ATeaker -or strongerX proportionally nearer or farther off. When the lights are too ear, the shadows will not be well defitzed; alld svhen they are tcyo far oS, they -will be too weak. It will greatly facilitate the calculations necessary in drawing conclusions from experimetlts of this kitld, if solue steady 3ighe of a ieroper degree of strength for that purpose be assumed as a standard, by which all others may be comparecI. I ha-ve cllosen for that purpose an ARGAND'S lamp) made in LorldonJ and very well finished; and thougll the quantity of llght emitted by thisX or any other kil:ad of lamp, is very-varixs + Since writing the above, I haare made a little alteration in the form of the box which contalns my photometer. The ont of it, instead of being opelz, is now closed and the light is admitted through two horizontal tubes, which are placed so as to form an angle of 60°; their axes meeting at the centre OIC the Eeld nf the instrument. Thc Zeld of the photometer ts viewed through arl operling made for that purpose in the middle of the frollt of the box, between the two tubes abovementioned. The annexed figures, tT'ab. X. XI. XII. XITI. will serve to gifire a clearer dea of the instruments as t now is, in its most im-proved statee MDiCCSC IV b Count RUMFQRD}S Account of a aMet1iod ofdepellding in a great snea$ure upon the length to which the wick is drawn out, yet I harre found by repeated trials that this latnp, once properly adjusted, continues to emit Xight more equally for a considerable time than any other lamps and much more so than any candle svhatelrer. At the beginning of each experilnent I adjust this standard light in the followilog tnanxler. Having placed the lamp uporl its carriage) at tEle distance of loo inclles from the centre of the field of the pllotometer, measuring froln tlae centre of the circular flame of the lamp,.a cylindric wax-candle, of known weight and dimensions, and which is kept merely for that pllrpose, beillg liglXlted and trimmed, and made to burr with the greatest possible-degree of brilliallcy, is placed over against it, at a certain given distallce (gg inches), and thell the wick of the lamp is drawn ouKt, or shortened, as it is found necessary, till the slaadows corresponding to tIze lamp and to tlle calldle) are precisely of tlleosame density, this done, the proof candle is extinguished) . and laid by for furtller use, and the projected experinlent isilulaledi.ate]y commenced. Here the proof canclle is, properly speaking, t:he staaldarclj but the lamp is to be preferred to it for tile experitnents, oll ac: count of the superior collstallcy or equality of its ligilt. -. The only danger of error ill this matter arises frotu tlat difficulty of procuring proof candles, which shall always give precisely the same quarltity of lightX or of making the same candle burn with exactly the same brilliancy at different times; I flattered myself at otl-e time that even this cause of error and uncertainty, however insurmountable the difficulty appearss might be in a great nleasure removed.

To determine precisely tlae exact amount of this ditmtnution of the light of the lamp B (whicll was the malrl obj!ect of the experiment), nothing more was necessary than to-bring this lamp nearer to the field of the photometerj till its light passing througll the glass should be in equilibrium witll thes direct light of the lamp A X or, in other words,till the equality ofthe shadows should be restored and thi-s I f4UIld C9USi UMFORD S Account oga Method ofgj actually happened when the lamp B, from oo inclles, wa-s-brougllt to thg distaince of90,2 inches from the field of the pllotometer. Now as it has already been shewn that the itltbnsities of the lights are as the squares of their distances from tlae field of the phototneter, the illuminations being equal at that field, it is evident that the light iof the lamp B was diminisheds in this experimenty in its passage through the pane of glass, in .. ..t the ratio of zoo to 9o,2*, or as 1 to ,8o6; so that no more tllan ,8136 parts of the light which impinged against the glass found its way tllrough it; thet other ,864 parts being dispersed and lost. To assure myself that the lamps still continued to emit the same relative quantities of light as at the beginning of the experiment, I now removed the pane of glass, and found that the equality of the shadows was again restored, when the lamp B arrived at its fornzer station, oo inches from the field of the photometer. This experiment I repeated no less than to times, arld foundt the loss of light in its passage through this pane of glass, takirlg a mean of all the experiments, to be ,l97g parts of the whole quantity that impinged against it; the variations in the results of the ^7arious experimerlts being from ,l720 to 92108.

The lamps A and B burnlng with clear3 brights and steady flames, were placed be fore the field of the photolneter, and one of them ras moved backs^7ards and brwards till the illuminations of the shadows in the field of the instrument were found to be precisely equal. 'rlle distance of the lamp B lelng then noted, this lamp was renzoved and a mirror belng put in its placen btlt nearer the sSLeld of tlae photometern the larup was so placed that its rays, striking the centre of the mirror were reflected against the field of the photometer) where, by bringing the laml) nearer to, or removing it farther from themirror, the illumitlation of the field by tllose reflected rays was now brought to be in equilibrium svitll-the illunlination of the standard lamp, and then the distance of the lamp from the centre of the mirror, and the distance from thence to the centre of the field, were carefully measured andnoted. These two distances added together? wYas the real distance through which the rays passed in order to arrI-ve at the fielcI of the photometer. Now as there is always a loss of light in refl-ectiona it is evident that the reflected rays tnust cotne to the field of the photonleter weaketled, and that irl order to illtlminate this field by these reflected rays as strongly as it svas illuminated by the direct rays of the same lamp the lamp must be brought nearer to the field. It is likewise evident from what has already been saidn that the ratio of the squares of those clistances of the lamp svhen its rays pass on directly and when they measuriltg the comparative Intensities of Light.97arrive after having been-reflected, are found to illuminate equally the field of the photometer, will be an accurate meastlre of the loss of the light in reflection.

I should certainly have made an experiment to determine the loss of light in its reflection from the surface of a plane metallic mlrrorn but I had no such mirror at handf The difference of the angles of incidence at the surface of tlae lmirror, within the limits mentioned, namelyn ffom 45° to 85°, did not appear to affiect, in any sensible degree, the results of the experiments. I also found upon trial, that the ef | fEct produced by thedifference of the angles at which light impinges against a sheet of transparent glass through which it passes is: within the limits of 4o° or So° from the perpendicu-lar, but very triflings Qf the relative Quantitzes of ()il consamedn and of Light emitteda by an ARGAND'S Lamp and by a I<amp on the sommon Constrv-ction, witb a Riband!

This pOillt I determined in the following marlner. Having pIaced an ARGAND'S Iamp, well trimmeda and lourning with its greatest brilliancy before my photometer and over against it a very excelleIlt common lamp with a riband wick, about an inch wide, and which burnt with a nevsuring the comparatlre S^ltensztzes of L2ght. 99 clear, bright flame, without the Ieast appearance of smoke, I found tlle intensities of the light emitted by the two lamps to be to eaclS other as 179456 to 9063 the densities c)f the shadows being equal when the ARGAND'S being placea at the dista-nce of S4 inches, the common lamp was placed at the distance of 9rn2 inchesS from the field of the photometer. Both lamps having been very exactly weighed svhen they were lighteds they were now (without being removed from their places before the photometer) caused to burn with the same brilliancy just So lninutes; when they were extinguished and weighed againn and were found to have consumed of oil, the ARGAND'S lamp 821593Z and the comlnon lamp 8tI6932 of a Bavarian pollnd. Now as the quantity of light produced by the ARGAND'S 1amPS in this experiment, is to the quantity produced by the common Iamp as zy956 to 906gS or as 187 to loo ; while the quantity of oil consutned by the former is to that consumed by the latter only in the ratio of 253 tO 163, or as s to ooo, it is evident that the quantity of light produced by the combustion of a given quantity of oil in an ARGAND's-lamp is greater than that produced by burning the same quantity in a common lamp, in the ratio of z87 to oSS orase woo to S.S The saving, therefore, of oil which arises from makirlg use of an ARGAND'S larup instead of a common lamp in the production of light, is evident; and it appears from this experiment that that saving cannot amount to less than per cent How far the advantage of this savillg lnay under certain circllmstances, be counterbalataced by inconveniences that lnay attend the making use of this improved lamp, I will not pretend to determinee O 2 Count RUMFORD)S Accoant of a Method oftooOf the relative Quantities of Light ensitted by an ARGAND'S Lamp, and by a common tYax Candle. I have made a considerable number of experiments to determine this poillt, and the general result of them is, that a common ARGAND'S lampj burning with its usual-brightnessf gives about as much light as nine good wax candles; but the sizes and qualities of candles are so various, and the light pro; duced by the same candle so fluctuating, that it is very difficult to ascertain with any kind of precision, what a carnrnon was calldle is, or llow much light it ought to give. I once found that my ARGAND'S lamp, when it was burning with its great-est brilliancy, gave twelve tilnes -as much light as a gooct xvax candle ^ of an incll in diameter, but never moreQ Of tb-e Flzuctzzatians of tbe Ligh emitted by (:andles. 15o determine to what the ordinary variations in the qllantsty of ligllt emitted by a common wax candle might amount, I took sucll a candle, and lghtitlg it, placed it before the photometer, azd over agailast it an ARGAND'S lamp, vvh-icla was btlrning with a s ery steadyr flame T and nreasuring the intenM sity of tlle light emitted by the candle from time to time, duriilg an houre tlle candle being occasionally snuffed when it apeared to stand in need of ity its light was found to v;ary froln woo to about 6O. Tlle light of a wax candle of ala inferlor qclality vvas still more-unequal, but earen thls was but triflillg compared to the inequalities of the light of a tallow caladle. An ordinary tallolv candle, of rather an inf-erior quality, llaving been just snuffied, ancl burllillg vith its greatest bril measvrzing tbe comparatzve Irt!;exszties of Lrghtiolliancya its light was as loo , in elenren minutes it was but ,gg<; after eight minutes more had elapseds its li«t ras reduced to 2-3 X and in ten minutes more, or tsventy-nine minutes after it had been last snuffUdf its light was reduced to 16. Upon be Ing again sllu-ed it recovered its original brilliaxlcy, loo. Of the relative Quant2tles of Bees Wax, Tallow, Olive Oil Ptate Oz7, and Linseed Oit consunzed in the Prodactials) of JLigZM. In order to ascertain the relative quantities of bees wax and of olive oil c<risulmed irl the productioll of light, I proceeded in the follow7ing lnanner. Having provideel all encl of a wax candle of the best qualityS 68 of an inck in dialneter, andl about four illches in length, alld a lamp with five small wicks wllich I had found uporl trial to gi+te tlle sarne quantity of ligh.t Mas the candle I weighed very exactly the candlef and the lamp filled wTitla oilS and then placing them at equal distances (40 inclles) before tlaefield of the photometer I lighted thetn both at the same tirne e and after having caused them to burn vvith precisely the same degree of brtghtu--ess just one cornplete hogrS I extinguished them both, and weighing them a second tilne, t found that 100 parts of wax, and 129 parts of oil had beua cdonsumed. Hence it appearss that the coalsumption of bees wax is to the consumption of olive oil, in the production of the same g-ven quantity of light, as loo is to 129. Ilz this experiment 1lo circumstance utas xglected that could tend to render t}w result of it conclusive. Care utas taliell toh Sllff the candle very often with a pair of sharp scissars, in order tomake lt bllrn constantly witla the same de$ree of brilliancy * Count RUMFORD'S Account of a Method of-1OXand-the light of tlle larllp was, during the whole time, kept in the naost exact equilibriutn with the lighe of the candle; -which was easily dorle by occasionally drawing out, a little . -more or less, one or lnore of its five equal wicks. These wicksg uThich were placed in a right line perpendicular to a 1ine drawn from the middle svick to the lmiddle of the field of the phstometer, were about ItO of an itch in dianaeter each, atld + of an inch from each other, and when they wtere lighted, their flames united into one broad, thixl, alld very clear, white flame, withrout tlle least appearatlce of slnoke. In order to a-scertain the relative consumption of o]irre oil and rape ctil, in the production of light, tsro lamps, like tllat just described, were made use of v arld the experiment being ;made svith all possible care, the consumptioll of olive oil appeared to be to that of rape oil, in the production of the same quatltity of light as X 29 is to X 25. The experiment being aftervvards repeated with olive oil and very pure linseed oil , the consumption of olive oil appeared to be to that of the litlseed oil as 129 to 120. The experiment being twice made with olive oil, and with a tallow candle; once whSen the candle, by being often snuSed wras made to burn collstantly with the greatest possible brilliancyS and once when it was suSered to burn the svhole time wiith a very dim light, owing to the want of snuffing, the re sults of these experiments were very reluarkable. When the candle burnt with a clear, bright flame, the consutnption of the olive oil was to the consumption of the tallow as 129 is to tol ; but when the candle burnt Witi1 adim ligllts the coIlsumption of the olive oil was to the consumption of the tallow as 129 is to 229. So that it appeared from this last measvrgng the comparatzve Intensttzes of Ligbt.losexperiment, that the tallow, irlstead of being nearly as productive o£ light in its combustion as bees wax, as it appeared to be when the candle was kept coxlstantly well snuied, was now, when the candle was suered to burn with a ditn lightn by far less so than oil. But this is rzot all; what is still more extraordinary is, that the very same candle, burning with a long wick and a: dim ligllt actually constlmed more tallow than when being pro-^ perly snuffied, it burnt with a clear, bright flame, and gave near three times as much light ! To be enabled tojudge of the relative quantities of lightactually prod;uced by the cancilein thetwo experiments, it will sufEce to; know, that iru order to counterbalance this light at the field of thephotorrleter, it required, in the former experiment! the consumptiora of 141 partss but in the latter only the consuluption of 64 parts of olive oil. But in the former experi:ment 11o partsX and inthe latter <14 parts of tallow were actually found to be collslltned. These parts were 8lgaths of a Bavarian pound. From the results of all the foregoingexperiments it appears, that the relative expence of the underrnentioned inflammable $ubstances3 irl the production of light, isas follovv-s.

Likewise burllt iI} the same manner, 120 I should have been very glad to have made the eperitnent with whale oil, but there ^vas notle to be had in thecountry I inhabit. With the foregoing table, and theprices current of the thereinmentioned articles, the relative prices of light produced by those diSerellt materials may very readily be computed. The light of a mrax candle, for instance, costs just nine times more at Munich, tllan the same quantity of light produced by !3urning rape oil in atl ARGAND'S lamp. Of the Transparency of Flames To ascertain the transparency of flame, or the measure of tlle vesistance it opposes to the passabe of foreign or extrazeous light through it, I placed before the photometer, over against the standard lamp, two burllillg slvax candles, ssell trimlned, and pUttitlg them near togetller, sometimes by the sides of each other, and sc)metimes in a straight line behind each others I found that when tlltir distances from the field of the photosneter srere t-he same, the irltensity of the illuminatioll was to all appearance the same, whether the light of the one was suade to pass through the flame of the other, or not. And ezeasuring Ihe comparative ISenst£tes oJ? Lightlasthe same held good with very littfle variatiollg w}wen t}areeZ atld even wllenXfour candles vere made use of-in the experi ment, instead vf two. I even caused a lamp to be constructed WitTl nine rcoula£1 wicks, placed in an horizolltal line, and just so far asunder as to prevent their flames uniting, arld no farther. And ]: fourld, upon repeating the experimerlt witll this lanapg that the restllt was much the same as with the candles; twhe intensity of tlhe illuluination at the field of the pllotometer being v-ery nearlLy the same, Whether these nine lights srere placed so as to covert and pass through each other, or not. But I afterwards found means to denonstrate tlie xtery great transparency of flarne by a stil1 luc)re simple experiment. Suspecting that the only reason -why bodies are not visible through a sheet of vivid flatne is, that the light of the flame affects the eye in such a manner as to render: it insensible to the weaker light emitted by, or reflected from the objects placed behind it? I conceived tllat a very strong light would not only be visible through a weak flarne, but also (as all transparellt lSodies -are invisible) that it might perhaps cause the flame totally to disappear; to determine that fact, I took a ligllted candle at mid-day, the surl shitling moderately bright, and holding it up betxveen my eye and the surl, I found the flame of the candle to disappear entirely. It was not everl necessary, irl order to cause the flame to become invisible, to t rirng it to be directly betsseen the eye and the body of the sun , it was sufficient for that:purpose tc) bring it into tlhe neighbourhood of the-Sun, wlaere the light was very strong: -even in a situation in N71zich the light was not so strong as to dazzle the eye so nluch MDCGXCIV.
