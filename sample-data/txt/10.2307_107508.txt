XXI. A new method of solving numerical eqi ations of, all orders, by continuous approximation.* By W. G. Horner, Esq. Communicated by Davies Gilbert, Esq. F. R. S. Read July 1, 1819. 1. TnH E process which it is the object of this Essay to establish, being nothing else than the leading theorem in the Calculus of Derivations, presented under a new aspect, may be regarded as a universal instrument of calculation, extending to the composition as well as analysis of functions of every kind. But it comes into most useful application in the numerical solution of equations. 2. ARBOGAST'S developement of p (aM + AX + 7X9 + zX3 + ?X 6+ .. ) (See Calc. des Der. ? 33) supposes all the coefficients within the parenthesis to be known previously to the operation of p. To the important cases in which the discovery of ) ~, &C3 . depends on the previous developernent of the partial functions P (o + +X) j (a + AX + rtx2), &c. * The only object proposed by the author in offering this Essay to the acceptance of the Royal Society, for admission into the Philosophical Transactions, is to secure beyond the hazard of controversy, an Englishman.'s property in a useful discovery. Useful he may certainly be allowed to call it, though the produce of a purely mathematical speculation ; for of all the investigations of pure mathematics, the subject of approximation is that which comes most directly, and most frequently into contact with the practical wants of the calculator. How far the manner in which he has been so fortunmte as to contemplate it has conduced, by the result, to satisfy those wants, it is not for him to deteimirne; but his belief is, that both Arithmetic and Algebra have received some degree of improveX Bent, and a more intimate union. The abruptness of transition has been broken down into a gentle and uniform acclivity. Mr. HORNER'S new method, &'. 309 it is totally inapplicable. A theorem which should meet this deficiency, without sacrificing the great facilitating principle of attaching the functional symbols to M alone, does not appear to have engaged the attention of mathematicians, in any degree proportionate to the utility of the research. This desideratum it has been my object to supply. The train of considerations pursued is sufficiently simple; and as they have been regulated by a particular regard to the genius of arithnetic', and have been carried to the utmost extent, the result seems to possess all the harmony and simplicity that can be desired; and to unite to continuity and perfect accuracy, a degree of facility superior even to that of the best popular methods. Investigation of the Method. S. In the general equation ePx =0, Iassum ex-R+r+ r'+r"l+... * and preserve the binomial and continuous character of the operations, by making successively x=R +z =R+r +z' R' zR/+r'+z" R B + z"o =cc Where Ret represents the whole portion ofx which has already been subjected to I, and zA= rt+zx' the portion still excluded ; but of which the part vc is immediately ready for use, and is to be transferred from the side of z to that of R, so as to change P Ry to p R0t without suspending the corrective process. 4. By TAYLOR'S theorem, expressed in the more convenient manner of ARBOGAST, we have ARDR A (+R + z) 1R +DpR 0,x 4 D(R .z2+ D I 3R z' + 2 310 Mr. HoRNER's new method of solving numerical Where by DI qR is to be understood 2 dn R viz, the ntb derivee with its proper denominator; or, that function which ARBOGAST calls the derive'e divise'e, and distinguishes by a c subscribed. Having no occasion to refer to any other form of the derivative functions, I drop thedistinctive symbol for the sake of convenience. Occasionally these derivees will be represented by a, b, c, &c. 5. Supposing OpR and its derivees to be known, the mode of valuing aR' or p (R + r) is obvious. We have only to say in the manner of LAGRANGE, when preparing-to develope his Theory of Functions, _pR =R + Ar A=DYpR +Br B DqpR + Cr CD3pR + Dr V Dn-2R + Ur U DnpR +r . Taking these operations in reverse order, we ascend with rapidity to the value of p (R + r) or OR. 6. The next point is, to apply a similar principle to discover the value of q (R + r + r') (( + r') R'. We here have OpR' (PR' + A' r' A'DqR + Br' B' D DqR'+ C' r' C' D3pR'+ D' r' V= D,-, OpR' + U' r' U' J = D'-' qR' r' But the former operation determined pR' only, without giving the value of any of the derived functions. The very simple equations of all orders, by continuous approximation. i i scale of known quantities, therefore, by which we advance so rapidly in the first process, fails in those which follow. 7. Still we can reduce these formulae to known terms for since we have in general v s rev i r+ **?*r+ rus Dr DI Bon---,----+s D 1 2 ~~~~~S (See ARBOGAST, ? 137); by applying a similar reduction to the successive terms in the developement of Dm (pR' Dm (R + r), we obtain* DmpR'_1D'..R + m+Dm+1 R r + 2 2 Dm+2 OR. re +m+ I .....nm+3 Dm+3 3+& And it is manifest that this expression may be reduced to a form somewhat more simnple and at the same time be accommodated to our principle of successive derivation, by introducing the letters A, B, C, &c. instead of the functional expressions. 8. As a general example, let M=Dm qd(RNr N R Dm+I1+ Pr P aDm+2R + Qr* This theorem, of which that in Art. ' is a particular case [m -oj, has been long in use under a more or less restricted enunciation, in aid of the transformation of equations. HALLEY'S Speculum Analyticum, NEWTON's limiting equations, and the formula in SiMPsON's Algebra (ed. 5, p. s66, circafn.) are instances. In a form still more circumscribed [ras, Ro, x, 2, &c-] it constitutes the Nouvelle Metbode of B U D A X; which has been deservedly characterized by LAG RA N G E as simple and elegant. To a purpose which will be noticed hereafter, it applies very happily; but regarded as an instrument of approximation, its extremely slow operation renders it perfectly nugatory : and as L i G N D RE justly reported, andl these remarks prove, it has not the nerit of originality. 12 Mr. HoRNER's new method of solving nuerical represent any successive steps in the series in ArtA; then are DM OR=M _Nr Dm+ 1;R R N-Pr Dm+zR R=P Qr And by substituting these equivalents in the development just enounced, it becomese D' OR= M + m Nr + m Prz + mu *m + &c g. With this advantage, we may now return to the process of Art. 6, which becomes OR" R' 4. A' r' At (A + Br+ Crt + Dr +E &c.) +B' r B' (B + X Cr + 3 Dr' + 4Er + &c.) + CI' C'=(C+ Dr+ 6 Er, + &c.) + D' r' V'=(V+ 1Ur+nT2 nY r2)+U'r U1 (U + t , r) + t'r *** f. Taking these operations in reverse order as before, by determining U', VI.4 . C', B', A', we ascend to the value of OR'I" io. In this theorem, the principle of successive derivation already discovers all its efficacy; for it is obvious that the next functions U", V' '.9,. C", B", A", qR"', flow from the substitution of A', B', C' .. Y U, OR!', r', r, for A, B, C .*.. V, U., OR' r ?' in these formulae; and from these U"l, Vl' ,&c; and so on to any desirable extent. In this respect, Theorem II, algebraically considered, perfectly answers the end proposed in Art. 2. ai. We perceive also, that some advance has been made toward arithmetical facility; for all the figur'ate coefficients equations of all orders, by continuous approximation. Ats here employed are lower by one order than those which naturally occur in transforming an equation of the nth degree. But it is much to be wished, that these coefficients could be entirely dispensed with. Were this object effected, no multipliers would remain, except the successive corrections of the root, and the operations would thus arrange themselves, in point of simplicity, in the same class as those of division and the square root. 12. Nor will this end appear unattainable, if we recur to the known properties of figurate numbers; which present to ,our view, as equivalent to the nlh term, of the mtb series: i. The diference of the ntb and n -lb term of the mr + 1th series. 9. The sum of the first n terms of the mr-i1 series. I. The sum of the n h term of the M.n1 th, and the n_-th term of the Mth series. The depression already attained has resulted from the first of these properties, and a slight effort of reflection will convince us that the second may inimmediately be called to our aid. i3. For this purpose, let the results of Art. 9 be expressed by the following notation: PR"'= pR' + A' r' A'A + B' r' B' = B + C'r' C' = C3 + DYl V'V = V r+ U' r' U'= UI +r' -the exponents subjoined to any letter indicating the degree MDCCCXIX. S s 314 Mr. IIRNER'S new method of solving numerical of the figurate coefficients in that formula of the theorem, of which such letter is the first term. 14. Although this statement appears only to have returned to us the conditions of Art. 6, with all their disadvantages, and to have merely substituted A for DpR' or a' B2 for DEAR'or b' C3 for DEqBR' or c' &c. yet, by means of the property just alluded to, the essential data A, B, C, &c. which have disappeared, will again be extricated. For the developement of DmIpR', found in Art, 8, undergoes thereby the following analysis M+mNrm~ mPro+7 m "j2 I+ Qr3+ . .

This theorem employs exactly the same total number of addends as Theorem II, but with the ii potant improvement, that the num her of addends to each derivee is inversely as their magnitude, contrary to what happened befo~,, Figue rate multipliers are also exclde. And is easy to convnce ourselves that no embarrassment will arise froni the newly introduced functions. For if we expand any of the addends Nkarin the general forula equivalent to Mm. rd analyze it by means of the third proerty of figurate series, we shall find Mrr =Nr + P And since we takie the scale in our Theorem in a reverse or ascending order, this formula merely instructs us to multiply an addend already determined by r, and to add the product to another known addend; and if we trace its effect through all the descending scale, to the first operations, we observe that the addends to the last derivee, from which the work begins are simply r repeated n-:times. i6. Because N = N, the addend exterior to the parent thesis, might for the sake of uniformity be w ritten Near'. 0 The harmony of the whole scheme would then be more completely displayed. To render the simplicity of it equally perfect, we may reflect that as the factors r, r', &c. are engaged in no other manner than has just been sated, viz, in effecting the subordinate derivations, their appearance among the principal ones is superfluous, and tends to create embarrassment. Assu me therefore kN Nkr, and we have316 Mr. HORNER'S new method of solving numerical cpR"= pR' + OA' Al(A + AB) +OBI3 B'= (B + IC+ 2C) +0,C' C _ (C1D+2D+3D) +0D' V (V I +I" + * + * n7 X2U) + U U' _ (U + n-1 . r) + r' . . . ttILJ the subordinate'derivations being understood. 17. The Theorems hitherto give only the synthesis of ox, when x R + r + r' + &c. is known. To adapt them to the inverse or analytical process, we have only to subtract each side of the first equation from the value of Axe; then assuming Ox R Ax, we have A '=AA 0 A=a + B &c. as in Theorem I. A"=A'loAx A'= (A+ 1B) + OB' &c. as in Theorem II. or III. The successive invention of R, r, r', &c. will be explained among the numerical details. In the mean time, let it be observed that these results equally apply to the popular formula Ox = constant, as to pX = o. i8. I shall close this investigation, by exhibiting the whole chain of derivation in a tabular form. The calculator will then perceive, that the algebraic composition of the addends no longer requires his attention. He is at liberty to regard the characters by which they are represented, in the light of mere corresponding symbols, whose origin is fully explained equations of all orders, by continuous approximation. 3 17 at their first occurrence in the table, and their ultimate applI' cation at the second. The operations included in the parentheses may be mentally effected, whenever r is a simple digit. And lastly, the vertical arrangement of the addends adapts them at once to the purposes of arithmetic, on every scale of notation. General Synopsis. vb Der. n-z'1Derivee. n-3tbDerivee. .. 3rd.

The remarks which are yet to be adduced will bear almost exclusively on the Analytic portion of the Theorem, from which the Synthetic differs only in the less intricate management of the first derivee; this function having no concern with the discovery of the root, and its multiple being additive like all the rest, instead of subtractive. From the unrestricted nature of the notation employed, it is evident that no class of equations, whether finite, irrational or transcendental, is excluded from our design. In this respect indeed, the new method agrees with the established 318 Mr. HORNER'S new method of solving numerical popular methods of approximation a circumstance in favo-ur of the latter, which is overlooked by many algebraists, both in employing those methods and in comparing them. with processes pretending to superior accuracy. The radical Draw ture which distinguishes them from ours is this: they forego the influence of all the derivees, excepting the first andl perhaps the second; ours provides for the effectual action of all. 2o. Concerning these derivees little need be said, as their nature and properties are well known. It is sufficient to state that they may be contemplated either as differential coefficients, as the limiting equations of NEWTON, or as the nume-rical coefficients of the transformed equation in R + z. This last elementary view will suffice for determining them, in most of the cases to which the popular solutions are adequate; viz. in finite equations where R, an unambiguous limiting value of x, is readily to be conjectured. When perplexity arises in consequence of some roots being imaginary, or difg fering by small quantities, the second notation must be called in aid. The first, in general, when Ax is irrational or transcendental. 21. The fact just stated, namely, that our theorem cons tains within itself the requisite conditions for investigating the limits, or presumptive impossibility, of the roots, demonstrates its sufficiency for effecting the developement of the real roots, independently of any previous knowledge of R. For this purpose, we might assume R o; r, r, &c. = i or . 1 &c. and adopt, as most suitable to these conditions, the algorithm of Theorenm II, until we had arrived at R", an unambiguous Lmiting valued of x. But since these initiatory researches equations of all orders, by continuous approximation. 319 seem more naturally to depend on the simple derivees, a, b, &c. than on A, B, &c. their aggregates ; and since, in fact, as long as ris assumptive orindependent of R,our system of derivation offers no peculiar advantage; I should prefer applying the limiting formula in the usual way; passing however from column to column (WOOD, ? 318.) of the results, at first by means of the neat algorithm suggested in the note on Art. 7, and afterwards by differencing, &c. as recommended by LAGRANGE, (Res. des Eq. Num. ? 13), when the nutimber of columns has exceeded the dimensions of the equation. (Vide Addendum.) If, during this process the observation of DE GUA be kept in view, that whenever all the roots of px are real, Dm-1 rnX and Drn+l px will have contrary signs when Dm ex is made to vanish, we shall seldom be under the necessity of resorting to more recondite criteria of impossibility. Every column in which o appears between results affected with like signs, will apprize us of a distinct pair of imaginary roots; and even a horizontal change of signs, occurring between two horizontal permanences of an identical sign, will induce a suspicion, which it will in general be easy, in regard of the existing case, either to confirm or to overthrow. 22. The facilities here brought into a focus, constitute, I believe, a perfectly novel combination; and which, on that account, as well as on account of its natural affinity to our own principles, and still more on account of the extreme degree of simplicity it confers on the practical investigation of limits, appears to merit the illustration of one or two familiar examples. 320 Mr. HORNER5s new method of solving numerical Ex. i. Has the equation x4x3 + 8* 2-6x + 2a0o any real root ?-See EULER, C. D. p. 678. X_ 0 1 2 20 9 4 -X6 X -0o 8 2 8 4-4 0 4 1 1 1 Here the first column consists of the given coefficients taken in reverse order. In the second, 9 is -the sum of the first col Umn,8, s -is ,6 + 2(8)+3(_ 4) +4(X)) is= 8 + 3 H4) + 6 (t), &c. The third col umn is formed from the second, by the same easy process. We need proceed no farther; for the sequences 2, o, 1 in the second column, and 4, o, 8 in the third, show that the equation has two pairs of imaginary roots. Consequently it has no real root. Ex. 2. To determine the nearest distinct limits of the poskt tive roots of X3 7X + 7 = o. See LAGRANGE, Res. des E N. ? 27, and note 4. ? 8. Operating as in the former example, we have x = 1 2 7 -7 -4 0 6 Since all the signs are now positive, 2 is greater than any of the positive roots. Again, between 4 and + *, it is manifest, that o will occur as a value of the first derivee, and; equal-ons of -all orders, by contznuous approximation. 321 that the simultaneous value of the second derivee will be affirmative. But as the principal result has evidently converged and subsequently diverged again in this interval, no conclusion relative to the simultaneous sign of that result can be immediately drawn. We will return to complete the transformations. For x_ 1.01 1.11 1.2 1.3 1.4 1.j5 1.6 1.7 1000 631 1 328 97 .-56 -21 41 1 400-3371-0268 301 33 36 Here the first column was formed from that under x-i, by annexing ciphers according to the dimensions of the functions; the 2nd and 3rd columns and the number 97 were found as in the former Example; the remaining numbers by differencing and extending the series Iooo,631,3o8,97. We have no need to continue the work, since the changes of signs in the principal results indicate the first digits of the roots in question to be a.p and 1.6. But if we proceed by farther differencing to complete all the lines, the columns standing under these numbers will give the co-efficients of c(i.3 + z) and 0 (iA6 + z) without farther trouble. 2A3. Assuming, then, that R has been, determined, and R + z substituted for x in the proposed equation, thereby transforming it to Aaoaz 4 bz%+ cz3+dz4+. it is to this latter equation that the analytical part of our theorem is more immediately adapted. Now the slightest degree of reflection will evince, that our method is absolutely identical for all equations of the same order, whether they MDCCCXIX. T t 322 Mr. HoRNER'S new method ofsolving numerical be binomial or adfected, as soon as the transformation in R has been accomplished. The following description, therefore, of a familiar process in arithmetic, will convey an accurate general idea of our more extensive calculus, and obviate the necessity of any formal precepts. In EVOLUTION, the first step is unique, and if not assisted by an effort of memory, could only be tentative. The whole subsequent process may be defined, division by a variable divisor. For an accurate illustration of this idea, as discoverable in the existing practice of arithrneticians, we cannot however refer to the mode of extracting any root, except that of the square; and to this, only in its most recently improved state. Here, in passing from onle divisor to another, two additive corrections are introduced.; the first depending on the last correction of the root, the second on the correction actually making. And this new quotient correction of the root, since it must exist previously to the completion of the divisor by which it is to be verified, is required to befound by means of -the incomplete divisor; and may be taken out, either to one digit only, as is most usual, or to a number of digits equal to that which the complete and incomplete divisors possess in common. And farther, as these divisors may not, in the first instance, agree accurately even in a single digit, it is necessary at that stage of the operation, mentally to anticipate the effect of the new quotient, so as to obtain a sufficiently correct idea of the magnitude of the new divisor. 24. This is an accurate statement of the relation which the column headed by the first derivee bears to the analysis. The remaining columns contribute their aid, as successively subsidiary to each other; the contributions commencing with equations of all orders, by continuous approximation. 323 the last or n-1th derivee, and being conveyed to the first through a regular system of preparatory addends dependent on the last quotient-correction, and of closing addends dependent on the new one. The overt and registered manner of conducting the whole calculation, enables us to derive important advantage from anticipated corrections of the divisors, not only at the first stepi, but, if requisite, through the whole performance, and also, without the necessity of a minute's bye-calculation, communicates, with the result, its verification. 25. Let us trace the operation of the theorem as far as may be requisite, through the ascending scale of equations. 1. In Simple equations, the reduced equation may be represented by A = az ; whence z = Now the theorem directs us to proceed thus: a ~A (r~r'+*eX* ar ar' AU -ar! a/ft &c. precisely the common arithmetical process of division. 2. In Quadratics, we have A az.+ zX, and proceed in this manner: X a A(r+r'+. r -Ar A A# &XC. _~~~ 324 Mr. HORNER'S new method of solving numerical the known arithmetical process for extracting the square root. a. At Cubic equations, the aberration of the old practice of evolution commences, and our theorem places us at once on new ground. We have here A = az + bzob+ z3 and must proceed thus: 1 b a A(r+r+.. r BrB -Ar B ?A A~~~A :zr t BrB-A' eB'r' &c. &C. A' &C. This ought to be the arithmetical practice of the cube root, as an example will prove. Ex. I. Extract the cube root of 48228544. Having distributed the number into tridigital periods as usual, we immediately perceive that the first figure of the root is = R. Consequently, the first subtrahend is R3-27 the first derivee S32=27, the second 3R=9; the third (=l,) need not be written. Hence 482928544( 364 9. 27. 27 6 576 212 _ 4S'$ _ ~~~~~~~~~21L ,28 961? 8276 as--19656 12. 612.. 4 14$36 572544 _ @.0/o _ 8 ~~~~15;795441 M084' o393136f,0 In this example the reader will perceive that no supplementary operations are concealed. The work before him is complete, and may be verified mentally. I need not intihate equations of all orders, by continuous approximatzion. 325 how much more concise it is than even thae abbreviated statement 0f the old process. (See HUTTON'S Course.) The station of' i, 2, &c. numeral places respectively, which the closing addends occupy in advance of the preparatory ones is an obvious consequence of combining the numeral relation of the successive root-figures with the potential relation of the successive derivees. In fact, as is usual in arithmetic, we tacitly regard the last root-figure as units, and the new one as a decimal fraction; then the common rules of decimal addition and multiplication regulate the vertical alineation of the addends. 26. The advantage of mental verification is common to the solution of equations of every order, provided the successive corrections of the root be simple digits: for the parenthetic derivations wvill in that case, Consist of multiplying a given number by a digit, and adding the successive digital products to the corresponding digits of another given number; all which may readily be done without writing a figure intermediate to these given numbers and the combined result. For this reason the procedure by single digits appears generally preferable. Nevertheless, to assist the reader in forming his own option, and at the same time to institute a comparison with known methods on their own grounds, I introduce one example illustrative of the advantage which arises from the anticipatory correction of the divisors spoken of in Art. 24, when the object is to secure a high degree of convergency by as few approximations as possible. The example is that by which NEWTON elucidates his method. I premise as the depreciators of NEWTON do, that it is an extremely easy 3o26 Mr. HORNER'S new! method of solving numerical problem; and I say this to invite comparison, not so much with his mode of treating it, as with theirs. Ex. II. What is the value of x in the equation x3-UX-5. The root is manifestly a very little greater than 2. i Make it x 2 + z, and the equation becomes 1 = 10 z + 6z + z3.

Yet this example clearly affixes to the new method, a character of unusual boldness and certainty; advantages derived from the overt manner of conducting the work, which thus contains its own proof. The abbreviations used in the close of this example, are of a description sufficiently obvious and inartificial; but in order to perfect the algorithm of our method in its application to higher equations, and to the progress by simple digits, atten. tion must be given to the following general principles of Compendious Operation.

We have seen that every new digit of the root occasions the resolvend to be extended n figures to the right, and the mtb derivee n-m figures,; so that if the work be care ried on as with a view to unlimited progress, every new 328Mr. HORNER'S new method of solving numerical root-figure will be obtainied and verified at an expence of 2 (n. n + 3) + s new lines of calculation, containing in all somewhat above 6(n . n-i . n +4) digits more than the preceding root-figure cost. But as the necessity for unlimited continuity can rarely, if ever, occur, we may consider ourselves at liberty to check the advance of the resolvend, as soon as it contains one or two figures more than the number we yet propose to annex to the root. This wvill happen, generally speaking, when I th of the numeral places of the root are determined. By arresting the advance of the resolvend, we diminish it in the first instance by an optional number (p) of places, and by n places more at each succeeding step. Neglecting at the same time an equal number of figures in the right hand places of each closing addend and its derivatives, as contributing nothing to the diminished resolvend, we thus cause the effective units' place of each derivee to retrograde* in the first instance pa+m n places, and at every subsequent step, a number of places (in) equal to the index of the derivee. In the mean time, while these amputations are diminishing the derivees and addends on the right hand, a uniform average diminution of one digit on the left hand is taking place in the successive classes of addends in each column. The obvious consequence is, that after about m th of the rootM+z * As the advance of the closing addend is prepared by annexing dots to the superior preparatory addend, so its retrogradation may be prepared by a perpendicular line beginning before the proper place (the mih or m + p nth) of the said preparatory addend, and continued indefinitely downward. One digit, or two, of those which fall to the right of this line in the next succeeding sum and preparatory addends, must be retained, for the sake ultimately of correctly adjusting the effective units of the subtrahend. equations of all orders, by continuous approximation 29 figures are found, the mth derivee will receive no augmentation; or, in other words, it will be exterminated when . th of those places are determined. m Again, when all the derivees inferior to M, the mh, have vanished, the process reduces itself to that of the nzl order simply. For, the amount of the preparatory addends to L, the mn-it augmented derivee, will be m-i times the previous closing addend >M; and the preparatory addends to K, the m-2tA, will be formed from its previous closing addend L, by adding 0Mr to it m-2 times successively a irocedure obviously similar to that with which the geecral synopsis commences. 28. From these princples we form the following conclusions, demonstrative of the facilities introduced by this improvement on the original process: i. Whatever be the dimensions (n) of the proposed equation, whose root is to be determined to a certain number of places, only X' th part of that number (reckoning from the point at which the highest place of the closing addend begins to advance to the right of that of the first derivee) needs to be found by means of the process peculiar to the complete order of the equation; after which, n may be found by the process of the n-1a order, n * g by that of the n-sa h order, &c. 2. Several of these inferior processes will often be passed over per saltum; and when this advantage ceases, or does not occur, the higher the order of the process, the fewcr will be the places determinable by it. And in every case, the latter MDCCCXIX. U u Mr. HORNER'a new method of solving numerical half of the root will be found by division simply. Meantime, the number of figures employed in verification of each successive root-digit, instead of increasing, is rapidly diminishing. S. The process with which we commence, need not be of a higher order than is indicated by the number of places to which we would extend the root; and may be even reduced to an order as much lower as we please, by means of an in. troductory approximation. Ex. III. Let the root of the equation in Ex. IL be determined to the tenth place of decimals.

The work occupied a very few minutes, and may be verified by-mere perusal, as not a figure was written besides those which appear. By a similar -operation, in less than half an hour, I have verified the root to the whole extent found in Ex. II. Ex. IV. As a praxis in case of the intervention of negative numbers, let -it be proposed to extract, to a convenient extent, that root of the equation X37X 7 whose first digits we have already determined to be 1.3.

This example was selected by LAGRANGE for its difficulty. Of its three roots, that which we have now found is the most difficult to obtain ; yet the whole work, including the preparatory portion in Art. 22, may be performed without one subsidiary figure, in less than a quarter of an ho-,Ir. A little attention and practice will render the mnental ag" gregation of positive and negative numbers as familiar as the addition of either sort separately. The introduction of a small negative resolvend, instead of a large positive one, wIre the opportunity occurs, will then greatly abridge the operations. For example, the cube root of a, or 1,26.. 0078950105 259921049895 was determined to this extent, true to the 12th decimal place,, within as small a compass and as short a time as the result of Example III.

The other roots are imaaginary; for when . 4, the fourth derivee vanishes between two affirmative results, and when x =. 7 &c., the second disappears under similar circumstances. (Arts. 21, a.2g.) It appears to me, that no explanation of this solution can be offered, which has not been abundantly anticipated in this Essay; and the student who peruses it in connection with the General Synopsis, and Arts. 23, 27, will acquire an indelible impression of the whole algorithm. Ex. VI. If -it were proposed to obtain a very accurate solution of an equation of very high dimensions, or of the irrational or transcendental kind, a plan similar to the following might be adopted. Suppose, for example, the root of wx _ coo, or x log x = 2 were required correct to 60 decimal places. By an easy experiment we find x 3.6 nearly; and thence, by a process of the third order, xa .397285 more accurately.

The significant part disappears after the 8th derivee; consequently, the process will at first be of the eighth order. If the root is now made to advance by single digits, the first MDCCCXIX. X X 3344 Mr. HORNER'S new method of solving numerical of these will reduce the process to the seventh order; one more reduces it to the sixth order; two more, to the fifth, &c. The last 27 figures xvill be found by division alone. But if the first additional correction is taken to 8 figures, and the second to i6, on the principle of Example II, we pass from the 8th order to the 4th at once, and thence to the ist or mere division, which will give the remaining 29 figures. This mode appears in description to possess the greater simplicity, but is perhaps the more laborious. It cannot fail to be observed, that in all these examples a great proportion of the whole labour of solution is expended on the comparatively small portion of the root, which is connected with the leading process. The toil attending this part of the solution, in examples similar in kind to the last, is very considerable; since every derivee is at this stage to receive its utmost digital extent. To obviate an unjust prejudice, I must therefore invite the reader's candid attention to the fobl lowing particulars : In all other methods the difficulty increases with the extent of the root, nearly through the whole work; 'in ours, it is in a great measure surmounted at the first step: in most others,. there is a periodical recurrence to first conditions, under circumstances of accumulating inconvenience; in the new method, the given conditions affect the first derivees alone, and the remaining process is arithmetically direct, and increasingly easy to the end. The question of practical facility may be decided by a very simple criterion; by comparing the tlies of calculation which I have specified, with a similar datum by Dr. HALLEY in favor of his owu favorite rniethod of approximation. (Philosophical Transactions for Qi4+) equations of abl orders by continuous approximation. B Addendum I. (Vide Art. 21.) Note. But in this case, it will be more elegant to find the differences at once by the theorem AI+ IDmpRi=m+LAtDm+?'pR.r+mJQ m+?AtDm+21R, r+ &cI 1~ ~~~ 2 which, supposing r to be constant, is a sufficiently obvious corollary to the theorem in Art. 7. All the results may then be derived from the first column by addition. Thus,, for the latter transformations in Ex. I. Art. 22, the preparatory operation would be 1st. Terms. Duiff. ist. 2nd. 3rd. 1000 -369 66 6 -4cc 63 6 30~ and the succeeding terms would be found by adding these differences in the usual way to the respective first terms. Addendum II. It is with pleasure that I refer to the Imperial Encyclopaedia (Art. Arithmetic) for an improved method of extracting the cube root, which should have been noticed in the proper place, had I been aware of its existence; but it was pointed out to me, for the first time, by the discoverer, Mr. EXLEY' of Bristol, after this Essay was completed. It agrees in substance with the method deduced in Art. S5, from my general principle, and affords an additional illustration of the affinity between that principle and the most improved processes of common arithmetic. From the Press of W. BULMER & Co.
