1123 XVII Observation of the 1inter Solstice of S8 1 2, with the A'Iurac Circle at Greenwich. By John Pond, Esq. Astronomer Royal, F.RS.S. Read February 25, 1 8 1i3. PH E weather this year at the period of the solstice was peculiarly unfavourable for astronomical observation; however, in the course of the month, I obtained nine observations of the sun; one of these proved defective, the result of the other eight, accompanies this communication. In my observation of the summer solstice, it will be seen that I assumed the arc ZP equal 3803 1A 1 2il l1 5; by subsequent observation I conceive that I have somewhat improved this quantity, which I now assume 8' 3S1' 21",5, as resulting from 12o observations of Polaris. The observation of the summner solstice thus corrected will give the mean obliquity of the ecliptic for January 1, 1813, 23' 2751" ',o, and the winter solstice 230 27' 471,35. There can be no doubt but this small discordance might easily be reconciled by a slight modification of BRADLEY'S refractions, and perhaps ultimately it may be necessary to h&ve recourse to this theory for its explanation; but I amn un-t willing to do this hastily, being now occupied in making an extensiveseries of observations of circumpolar stars, with a view of determining, if possible, whether BRADLEY'S mean refraction does, or does not, require alteration._As I propose making the discordance of the solstices the subject of a sepa124 Mr, PONDS Observation of the xinter Solstice, &c. rate paper, I shall not add any thing farther on the subject, excepting a recommendation to astronomers, to deduce their refractions from circumpolar stars altogether, and then exam mine the solstices with those refractions, and by no means to make the coincidence of the solstices a required proof of their accuracy. Note. In the annexed computation the reduction to the solstice is computed from the observed right ascension of the sun, by this means the errors of the tables being avoided, observations at a considerable distance (even some weeks from the solstice) may be employed, particularly in the winter season, when the uncertainty from refraction is greater than the error which may be probably introduced into this part of the calculation. 4*. 00 0 H~~~~~~~~~ 0 | , | | .... a | ?
