[247] XII. An Eclipse of the Moon, observed at Mr. Graham's in Fleet-street, by John Bevis, M. D. and Mr. James Short, F. R. S. [Read Dec. 14. 1749.] 1749. By the Clock. App. Time.

The Appulses of the Shadow to the Spot Tycho were observed with a Reflecting Telescope, which magnified about 40 times, and may be serviceable for geographical Purposes. The Beginning and End of the Eclipse were estimated by the bare Eye, and a Refracting Telescope of a small magnifying Power; larger Powers being apt to dilute the Shadow too much, and thereby render these Phases more uncertain. Apparent Time. A Computation by Dr. Halley's Tables 6~ 52' 0'' gave the Beginning End 9 14 58 XIII.
