Extract of a Letter from the Reverend Henry Miles, D. D. & F. R. S. to the President, relating to some Improvements which may be made in Cyder and Perry. T H E Design of communicating the following Paper to the Royal Society is, to invite Gentlemen, after the Example of a Practice that has long obtained in Herefordshire, to attempt an Improvement of their waste Lands, by planting such kind of Fruit trees, as are mentioned, in Hedges and barren Places; which, for aught appears, would thrive as well in other Counties, perhaps in some Parts of most Counties in England, as in that of Hereford. The Letter read Nov. 1745. Extract from a Manuscript, written Anno 1657-8, by Mr. afterwards, Dr. John Beale, & F. R. S. in the Way of an epistolary Address to S. Hartlib, Esq; for his Use and that of Mr. Pell, the then British Resident at Zurich; and which appears to have been intended as a Sequel to that scarce and valuable Piece intituled Herefordshire Orchards, inserted in the later Editions of Mr. Bradley's New Improvement of Planting, &c. Concerning [517] Concerning an excellent Liquor made of a Mixture of rough Pears and Crabs. THE Author undertakes to evince, `` That Crabs and wild Pears, such as grow in the wildest and `` barren Clifts, and on Hills, do make the richest, `` strongest, the most pleasant and lasting Wines that `` England yet yields, or is ever like to yield. '' `` I have so well proved it already (says he) by so `` many hundred Experiments in Herefordshire, that `` wise Men tell me, that these Parts of England are `` some hundred thousand Pounds Sterling the bet`` ter for the Knowledge of it.'' He mentions, of these Kinds of austere Fruit, the Bareland Pear and the Bromsbury Crab, of which Notice is taken Page 4th of the Tract intituled Herefordshire Orchards; and intimates, `` That tho' the `` Discovery of them was but then lately made, yet `` they had gotten a great Reputation.'' He adds, `` The croft Crab and white or red Horse-pear do `` excel them, and all others, known or spoken of `` in other Countries.'' Of the red Horse-pear of Felton or Longland he observes, ~ That it has a `` pleasant masculine Vigour, especially in dry `` Grounds, and hath a peculiar Quality to over`` come all Blasts.'' Of the Quality of the Fruits he says, `` That such is the Effect which the Auste`` rity has upon the Mouth on tasting the Liquor, `` that the Rustics declare 'tis as if the Roof were filed away; and that `` neither Man, nor Beast, care `` to touch one of these Pears, tho' never so ripe.'' Of the Pear called Imny-Winter, which grows about Rosse (in that County) he observes, `` That it is of 2 `` no [518] `` no Use but for Cyder; that if a Thief steal it, he `` would incur a speedy Vengeance; it being a `` furious Purger; but, being joined with well chosen `` Crabs, and reserved to a due Maturity, becomes `` richer than a good French Wine; but, if drank `` before the Time, it stupefies the Roof of the `` Mouth, assaults the Brain, and purgeth more vio`` lently than a Galenist.'' This Quality, he apprehends, will sufficiently secure the Fruit from being stolen, tho' the Trees should be planted in the most remote Grounds. Of the Quality of the Liquor he says, `` That, ac`` cording as it is managed, it proves strong Rhenish, `` Backrac, yea pleasant Canary, sugar'd of itself, `` or as rough as the fiercest Greek Wine, opening `` or binding, holding one, two, three, or more `` Years that no Mortal can yet say at what Age `` it is past the best. This (adds he) we can say, `` that we have kept it till it burn as quickly as `` Sack, draws the Flame like Naphtha, and fires the `` Stomach like Aqua Vitae.'' He faith, `` That he `` made Trial at his own House with Wine d'Hay, `` by a Merchant of Bristol highly extoll'd, which, `` compar'd with a Liquor made of Crabs and wild `` Pears, was so much inferior, in the Judgment of `` all, that the Comparison was ridiculous.'' And he further relates, `` That a Gentleman (Sir H. Lingen) `` a great Planter, and expert in many Experiments, `` had then by him many Tuns of a Liquor made `` with this Mixture of Fruit, which he, by a designed `` Equivocation, called Pearmaine Cyder, that car`` ried the Applause from all Palates that all his `` common [519] `` common Hedges yielded him Store of the said `` Fruit.'' To recommend this easiest, cheapest, and most profitable kind of Agriculture, (as he calls it) he says, `` That the best of these Pears grow upon very bare `` and sandy Hills, or Vales; Crabs on any Mound `` or Bank that may be raised on an Heath; that one `` Pear tree ordinarily bears yearly 40, 50, 60, 70 `` Gallons of Statute-Measure, and some 5, 6, or 7 `` times as much. Since I undertook this Argu`` ment (adds he) within 10 Miles of this Place we `` made in one Year 50,000 Hogsheads, as I exa`` mined, not by Fancy, but by Rule and Inquiry; `` and this shews the Hardiness of the Fruit. Let `` our noble Patriots weigh, that this is not a `` Thing in the Air, but a most certain and appa`` rent Truth, importing no less than the Art of `` raising Store of rich Wines on our common `` Arable, on our Hills, and waste Grounds; the `` Charge a Trifle, the Pains very small, the Profit `` incredible. Hence my Design is to urge the in`` credible Benefit that would redound to these Na`` tions, if leading Persons would make themselves, `` their Tenants and Cottagers, all happy by follow`` ing our Example. I leave the Reader to cast up `` how many Millions of Hogsheads of Wine, in a `` few Years, would be raised in the Land. And truly `` I conceive it the chief Cause, that in all these Times `` of late Wars, none of our poorest Cottages did see `` Want; in all Houses they had the same Number `` of Meals, and the same constant Fare: Our Ara`` ble seems not a Jot the less, nor our Pasture the `` less; and for some Uses the Shadow of the Or`` chard [520] `` chard brings on the Grass a Fortnight the sooner, `` as commonly for Ewes and Lambs.'' The Author concludes his Tract with these Words, `` If this Discourse be duly valued, we need not `` raise Wars to destroy one another, or eat up one `` another, as we do; in a short time we may be pro`` vided of Fruit enough for another World as big `` as this, and to make this a true Paradise.''
