(147) VI. A farther Account of the same Tree. By William Sherard, LL. D. R. S. S. THE Account I had of the Poyson-Tree from Mr. More (which probably he had from Mr. Dudley) is as follows. The Poyson-Tree grows to the bigness of Elder; I never saw the Leaf; the Wood is as cold as Ice; when laid on the Fire, of 5 or 6 Persons sitting by it, some will fall a swooning, fainting, or yawning, continuing so for some Days, others but a few Hours, and others of the Company not at all. I handle, cut and burn it with impunity; and so it is with several others, I suppose, according to their several Constitutions. It was never known to kill any body, but only to do hurt to some Persons. I have sent you all the Seeds of it, I can get. The Seeds he sent were but few, but I had a good quantity from Mr. Catesby in Carolina. He calls it a Water Shrub, of which he never saw Leaf or Flower. Tis a species of Toxicodendron, tho' not nam'd by Dr. Tournefort in his Institutions, p. 610. but I believe it to be Arbor Americana alatis foliis, succo lacteo venenata. Pluknet. Almag. 45. Tab. 145. Fig. I. which is a Species of Toxicodendron, that grew formerly at Chelsea Garden. What makes me think it to be this, is Mr. Dudley's writing 'tis like a Sumach, and that it is by some call'd the Swamp Sumach; this in its manner of growing and alated Leaves, very Y 2 much (148) much resembles the Sumach or Rhus; the Fruit is a white roundish dry Berry, growing in Clusters, so like that of Toxicodendron triphyllon folio sinuato, pubescente, Inst. R. Herb. 611. Hederae trifoliae Canadensi affinis planta: Arbor venenata quorundam H. R. Paris. as scarce to be distinguish'd from it. VII.
