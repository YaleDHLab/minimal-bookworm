(410) IV. Two Cases of Insects voided by the urinary Passage, communicated in a Letter to the Publisher, by Dr. Daniel Turner, Coll. Med Lond. Lic. Dec. 6. 1725. ON the 24th of November last, a poor Woman, in my Neighbourhood, came to crave my Advice for her Grand-child, an Infant of about 16 Months old, bringing with her a Worm, which she told me the Apothecary had just then drawn out of the Child's Penis, who had for several Days before labour'd under great Uneasiness; which (as usually term'd by these People) she call'd Convulsions of the Bowels. The Infant was continually drawing up the lower Limbs, and straining at both Sphincters; the Urine seemed to pass with Difficulty for some Days, till at last there came on a total Suppression, and the Worm, advancing, shew'd itself at the Extremity of the Urethra, when the Apothecary was called up to help them. I examined the Insect, and found it measur'd above 4 Inches, resembling the Worms usually excern'd per Podicem, of the Earth-worm Kind, but whiter; which made me think at first they had been mistaken, and that the same had been that Way excreted. Having directed what I thought proper, I went to the Apothecary, who has the Worm now in his Custody, to be better inform'd. He assures me, that, when he came to the Child, he saw a preternatural Body, which at first he knew not what to make of, hanging half an Inch out of the Glans and lying double in the Passage: Perceiving it farther advancing, he took hold of it, and with little Difficulty drew forth the same. 3 The (411) The Summer before the last, a Woman show'd me an Insect of the Maggot Species, with a crusty red Galea over the Snout, and a crescent or forked Tail, which she had just then voided by the urinary Passage.
