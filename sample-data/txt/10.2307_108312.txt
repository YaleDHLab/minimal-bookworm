[ 133 X. Investigation of an Extensive Class of Partial Differential Equations of the Second Order, in which the Equation of LAPLACE'S Functions is included. By G. W. HEARN, Esq., of the Royal Military College, Sandhurst. Communicated by Sir JOHN F. W. HERSCHEL, Bart., F.R.S., Sfc. Received February 19,-Read April 2, 1846. Theorem. IF u be a function of x and y satisfying the equation d2uc d-u +o nePu u0 where dad +ce= 0, then the solution will be where D de-d where V.-fe 0ydy + x Xy and Ax arbitrary functions of y and x, and Oin-(A1-c)(an2-c). where Aa? = a,+ ads and an is a function of n vanishing for n=O and for n= 1. I will proceed to demonstrate this curious theorem as briefly as possible. According to the notation, we may write the given equation du D dz+OnUO Then if vs=D~u we have vn+D nlu=Dvn. dv du. Suppose that D dip +I3nzDvn=DntD + u*. (ce.) where z is a function of x and y to be determined, also p,,n a function of u. Writing n+ I for n in equation (a.), we ought to have D + Dn+lDvn+D + lDu} I/yv (P. ) 134 MR. HEARN ON A CLASS OF PAtrIAL DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS. This circumstance will serve to determine z and P3 as follows: we have identically Dn+' {D d + n+lu} Dn+ {D dJu +c J + AaoDn+ lu =D2d' +P3nD {zDvJ,+ Aa.. Dv, by (a dvC =D2 dd-+f3nD tzv+1f an .

Now the symbol D represents e-P Wyand therefore if U=O, D"U=0, so that we have D dv +P,,zDv,,=0, ___ d2n fi3 df _dv or e-f0 .+ e-odx =0, or e ~~~dxdy A/n *dx dy d dvA dx dy_ On dp* or =v Z43 dx' dv, Ain WX dy integrating with respect to x, dv,, eA AIn Vn-fe xydy+Ax, and u=D -vfd f e 1...ndYdY ... the integral sign repeated n times. The theorem is therefore demonstrated. It may be easily shown that the equation of LAPLACE'S coefficients is included in the class here considered.
