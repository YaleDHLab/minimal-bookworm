L4191 XXII. An account of the organs of generation of the Mexican Proteus, called by the natives Axolotl. By Sir EvERARD HOME, Bart. V. P. Re S. Read June 17, s824. 1L UAT the Proteus from Germany as well as thatfrom Carolina, is an animal in its perfect state, I consider to have been proved by Baron CUVIER, in his account of the skeletons of these animals; and when I found that -their vertebrae were cupped, which is not the case in the Aquatic Salamander, to which in. many respects they -are, nearly allied, that ci'cuumstance alone, with me, distinguished them from all the lizard tribe. Having had the opportunity of examining the vertebrae of the Proteus from Mexico, and finding them also cupped, I could have no doubt of its belonging to the same tribe, and consequently an animal in it's perfect state. This, however required proofs, that could only be afforded by an examina,.tion of the organs of generation in a developed state. When Mr. bULLOCK went to Mexico I requested him to bring me some specimens, of this animal, and to collect information respecting it's habits, more particularly its mode of generation 'In compliance with my request, Mr. BULLOCK brought me several specimens they were found in a lake three miles from the city of Mexico. The temperature of the water is never b klow ;ot and the elevation of the lake above the 1+21-0 Sir EVERARD HOME'S account of the sea is 8ooo feet: they were all taken in the same week its the month of June: at that season they are so abundant as to form a principal part of the food of: the peasantry. One day in June Mr. BULLOCK saw them in the market in thousands for sale; these were brought from a lake called Tesenco, the elevation of which above the sea is still higher than the other. A number of the natives were carrying them home 6o or 70 in a string. Mr. BULLOCK was unable to procure any information rev specting them, not -even the marks thatdistinguish the male from the female: no one had take: notice of their food, ro -the f~male'. noe o ie theirbova, or of their young.* Amongth e specimens thus procured, some proved to be male, some female. The difference in the appearance of the external parts of generation is shown in the annexed drawings. Although in some respect similar to the Aquatic Sala-mandti, they ate b no means-the same. In the male, at the time the -testicle8are deelope-d, the externalI protrusion is greatest: i ist composed of numerous fine membranous plicn, which are not so distinct when the internal organs are less developed. The testiclesinitu are also shown, andc are of a more delicatetexturexthan in the Aquatic Salamrand -erbut the other viscerain the; abdomen'bear a closeresemblance to those in that animal,' particularly the kidneys, and a large gland, which must be analogous to the vesicular seminales,' not bing,'met with in the female.' It is curious, that in the momentary contact which takes * From examining the contents of the stomach, they are found to feed ox snails -and} thrimps. I7.hm.

Ace place between the external parts of the male and female, those of the male appear to surround and enclose those of the female, contrary to what happens in other animals. The female organs, in their developed state, are beautifully shown in the annexed drawings ; and from the appearance of the ova, they probably pass out singly. Now that the three different kinds of Proteus are ascern tamed to be perfect animals, Mr. RuSCONI's attack upon Mr. HUNTER'S want of sagacity, published at Milan in 1821, in his work, entitled "Amours des Salamandres Aquatiques, will revert upon himself and his friend Mons. de LACEPEDEF who too hastily concluded them to be larvae EXPLANATION OF THE PLATES PLATE XXI.
