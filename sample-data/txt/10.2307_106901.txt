C 217 3XVI. Dr. Halley's Quadrature of the Circle improved: being a Transf3rmation of his Series for that Purpose to -otbers which converge by the Powers of 80. By the Rev. John Hellins, vi6ar of Potter's Pury, in Northamptonshire. Coxlmunicated by Nevit Maskelyne,iD.D. F.R.S. axd Astronomer Roya. Read May 1S, 1794. 1* DR. HALLEY'S method of computing the ratio bf the diameter of the circle to its circumference was considered by himself, and other learned mathematicians, as the easiest the problem admits of. And although, in the course of a centuryy much easier methods have been discovered, still a celebrated mathematician of our own times has expressed an opinion, that no other aliquot part of the circumference of a circle can be so easily computed by means of its tangent as that which was chosen ly Dr. HALLEY, rriz. the arcll of 3o degrees. This opinion, whether it be just or not, I shall rlot now inquire-; my present design being to show, honv the series by which Dr. HALLLY computed the ratio of the diameter to the circumference of the circle, may be transformed into others of swifter convergellcy, and which, on account of the successive powers of IIO which occur in them, admit of an easy summation. 2 This transformatiorl is obtained by lneans o-f difFerent forms in which the fluerlts of some flalxions may be expresseclO MDCCXC IV. F .f 218Mr. HELLINS4S Improvenaent ofTo proceed with the greater clearness, I will here set down the fluxion in a general form, and its fluent, in the two series wllich are used in the following particular instance, and may be applied witll advaxltage in siinilar cases.

But it has also been found, that the fluent of the same fluxion may be expressed in series of other forms, which, though less sinlple tllan that above written, yet have their particular advantages. Amongst those other forms of series hich the fluent admits ofg tlaat svhich suits my present * xm n xon + n nw 2 n. xS + 2 tt purpose 1S 4 St. sn + n. 1 -St] m. m + n. m Jr 2 n. 1 -xnAs n. 2 n. 3 n.

I X80 of otller methods, may easily be ilavestigated by the rule givell ln page 64 of the third edition of EMERSON'S I7luxions, or its equality with the former series may be proved by algebra. 4. On accotltlt: of the sign before xX, in tlle last series, it may lze proper to remark, that its convelgency by a geotnetrical progression, svill not cease till 1 J xn becotnes = <, or x becotnes-;/2 s atld tlaat, when Z is a small qualltityg and n a large nutnher, this series svill converge almost as swiftly as the former. For itzstatlce, if x be-/3, and n-8, which are the values in the tolloxving case, the former series will CO11verge by the quantity tV s/X8 = 8XI, and this series by the n I quantity 1 _ xl 1 _ 1 -8 0 ; where tlle diffierence in convert,ency will be but little, and the divisions by 80 easier than those by Sx the Quadralure of the Circle9. With respect to the indices m and n, as they are here sup posed to be affirmative whole numbers, arld will be so in the use I am about t(3 make of them, the reader need not be detained with arly observations on the cases in which these fluents will fail, when the indices have contrary signs. 6. It may be proper further to remark, that by putting , z xn = zs and calling the first, second, third, &c. terms of the series xm nxmf t + t 28 ttn+211 3 + &c S.l-X' m-m+^t. I_xnl m.mn.mizn.

I come now to the transformation proposed, which will appear very easy, as soon as the comm-on series, expressing tlae length of an arch in terms of its tangerlt, is properly arranged. If the radius of a circle be , and the tangent of an arch of it be called t, it ls well known that the lengtll of that arch will be = t3 + 5 7 + p t, + &C. Now, if the affirmative terms of this series be written RI1 one line, and the negative ones in another, the arch will be f t + 5 + 9 + ,3 + 17 + aCo _ o i t3 t7 tIl tl5 t 9 i _ &C t 3 7 t I IS 19 And if, again, the first, third, fifth, &c. term of each of these series be writtell ila one line, arid the second, fourth, sixtla, &c. in anot'ller, the surne arch will be expressed thus: F f 2 Mr. HELLINS'S Improvement of220 ; t ++-+-+ 33 + &G. g 3 t5 + tl3 + tz + t + t + aC.

A1t which series are evidently of the firsL form sn article 3, and therefore their values may be expressed in the second form there given, or more neatly in the NEWTONIAN notation mentiolled in art; 6.

If therefore we multiply the last series by 6, and write s/12 for 5X3, and express their value in the form given in art. 6, we shall have the circumference of a cirole whose dia meter is , Ihe Quadrature of the Clrcle.r8I Sf 12 8 A + 16 B _ 24C 32 D & r + q 8 9.So -X7So 2SSo + 33.wo Ce t t 81v12_ 8A + 16B _ 24C * 329, &n t 5t9us° s3.so 2I.80 29.80 + 37,80 X ) (8IsoJZ _ 8A + 16B 24C + 32D &C J 3 3 8 ll.So lg So 27.8o 3S 8° ' * 7.27.80 15.80 + z3 ow 31 so + 39.80 ' 8. All these new series, it is evident, converge somewhat swifter than by tlle powers of 8Ot For in the first series, which llas tlle slowest convergency, the coefficients 9, '6, z5, &¢. are each of them Iess than 1 , so that its convergency-is somewhat swifter than by the powers of 80. 9. But allother a(lvantage of ttiese neur series is, that the numerator ad dellomirsator of every term except the first, in each of theln, is divisible by 8 S in consequence of svhich the arithmetical operation by them is much facilitated, the division by 80 being exclianged for a division by lo) whic<>h is no more than removing the decimal point. These series then? when the-Eactors WlliCll are coInmon to both numerators and denominators are expunged>: svill stand as below, (each of which still converging somewhat quicker than by the powers of 80), andsve shall have the circumference of a circle whose diametereis 1S' f8tvl2 A +) 2-B _ 3C+ 4D &C-r + <. 80 9.10 17.lO 25.10 33.lo s 9v12* A + 2B 3C + 4D &C J t 4°° 13.10 21.10 29.10 37.IO e _ r95/s2 A +^ 2B _ 3C + 4D &C J 80 11.10 19.10 27.IO 35.10 4 ) 3213 A + 2B _ 3C + 4D aC t 7.80 IS*10 ' X3.10 .31§IO 39e1Q 22X Mr. HELLINS'S lEmproveme?t c By which series the aritllmewtical computation will be much more easy tharl by the original seriesX April 30, I7944 J.
