PHILOSOPHIICAL TRANSACTIONS. I. Researches in the Integral Calculus.-Part II. By H. F. TALBoT, Esq. F.R.S. Received October 26,-Read November 17, 1836. ?1. HAVING explained a general method of finding the sums of integrals, I propose to apply it to discover the properties of different transcendents, beginning with those of the simplest nature. In the first place, therefore, I will show its application to the arcs of the circle and conic sections. As there will be frequent occasion to make use of cubic equations, I shall suppose their general form to be _-px2 + q x r -0. When therefore the letters p q r occur without explanation, it will be understood that they represent these coefficients. ? 2. Application to the Urcle. 'dx Let us take the integralj I + , and suppose nothing to be previously known concerning the properties of the function which it represents. Let us put, in the first place, I+ X2 = vX : x-vx +I= 0. The two variables x y will be roots of this equation, so that they must satisfy the conditionxy = 1. Also dx dy dx _ 8 =1 0 1+ T +-Vye = Vx V Z dx because S -0 in any equation whose last term is constant. 11 ' i I + 14S, t. Mncccxxxvll. B 2 MR. TALBOT'S RESEARCHES IN THE INTEGRAL CALCULUS. We thus obtain a characteristic property of the function J dx 1 + x= n namely, that if xy = I, f x +fY = const. The truth of which is otherwise evident, for if x = tan 0, then y = cotan d f = 0 and fy = 900 e.f x +fy = const. Next let us investigate such a relation between three of these integrals that they may have an algebraic sum. I V +x Assume 1 + x2 = ax . whence X3 + VX2 + (1-a) x + v = 0, where a is any constant quantity. The three variables x y z must be roots of this equation, which however gives only one necessary relation between them, viz. x + y + z = x y z. We have a V _ 1+ 2 dx dx aS i+2=VS ? +Sdx. But . = vsand S dx = dv, x ~ ~ ~ d ..aS + Pt : dx ..sfl dx = const. whence we obtain this well-known theorem in trigonometry. If the sum of three tangents equals their product., the sum of the carets 'is c0n.vant, The constant = 1800. Next let us suppose 1 + x2 a 2 k x3+ (v -a) x2 + x + v= 0. This gives only one necessary relation between the roots, viz. q = xy + xz +y z= Ie For the two other coefficients (v a) and v, may be made to agree vith nay two arbitrary quantities. Since we have MR. TALBOT'S RESEARCHES IN THE INTEGRAL CALCULUS. 3 XS 1 dx dx dx .*a S I+ X2X S$ 1 d But S y = r -,and here q = 1 andr= -v S 1 1' whence dx dv S -2 = and dx dv V. Also dx dV x V Therefore aS dx dv dv T + X V v sf. Sdx, = const., which furnishes this other well-known theorem, viz. If three tangents are such that the sum of their products = 1, then the sum of the arcs is constant. The constant in this case = 90?. The same theorem results from the supposition 1 1 + = v --+ ax; for this gives x3 + ax2 + + i aa and q = I is the only necessary relation between the roots. Also dx S I =vSdx+aSxdx. 1 +x2 But S x2=p2-2q= 2-, whence S xdx vdv Sxdx=~ d s Also Sd dvx Therefore S dd v d =+ vdva O E. D. a a 4 MR. TALBOT S RESEARCHES IN THE INTEGRAL CALCULUS. These theorems, and the analogous ones which exist between any number of tangents, are well known. But when we apply the method to the integral /x we obtain relations between circular arcs which appear to be of a more novel description, and perhaps have not hitherto been noticed. Of which I will proceed to give an example. Let us suppose 1 V/1x-=VX + 1, whence S + 2 w2 + = . In this instance the symmetrical v = -p, and therefore making this substitution, we have X + r x2 + ({ )x-r= O. There are therefore two necessary relations between the three roots, viz. pr q=_ -i. And since 1 77/172 = v X + 1 Bu ~~~~VI =XSt x+ x S dx =vSdx+Sdx. v7xx=. i-dr But S X2 _pa_2 q 2 F(-)=G vS x dxZ rd.2=r Also Sdx~d S d =dxdd whence this theorem: If the sines of three circular arcs are roots of the equatiov x3 + rx2 + ( X-1)x-r=O. the sum of the arcs is constant. I will give a numerical example of this theorem. The value of r is arbitrary. Suppose it to be =3-112 --04641016. MR. TALBOT'S RESEARCHES IN THE INTEGRAL CALCULUS. 5 The roots of the equation then have the following values: x-= 05 sin 30' =vsinO yz 0 94565-=sin 7101' -sin 7 z =-098154 sin (780 59') sin ?"; and the theorem gives the surm of the arcs, or S 7 = const. The word sum is used in an algebraic sense, as including the case where one or more of the arcs are to be taken negatively, or its definition is S ? = + 0 +? ??7". The same ambiguity in the signs pervades the whole of this class of forrnule. In the present instance 300 + 710 11 + 780 591 1800 the constant is a semicircle. Ex. 2. Let r = 0. *3 Ax= 0 ; and the roots are x = 0 = sin 00 z =-1 = sin -900 *.?7=0? a-90o ?7=_-90?; and the same formula gives, as before, o + #" = 1800. A very extensive class of formulae respecting the arcs of the circle may be obtained in a similar manner, by applying the method more generally. Thus, if we make the supposition 1l ] ao + a, x . ..... i a n-I where a0, al . a.-, are constants, or any entire rational functions whatever of the variable v. we have an equation of 2 n dimensions, of which x is a root. If x = sin 7,, and the other roots are sin 02' sin 03, . sin d2n then r dx d vl-x2 o and the other integrals = -2, ?3 . * * 02n. And by a direct process we obtain the final equation S , or d1, + 2 + -**+ 02= v + const., f . v being an entire rational function of v. But since it is generally admitted that no combination of circular arcs can be equal to an algebraic quantity, I conclude that we have generally f.V = 0. MR. TALBOTS RESEARCHES IN THE INTEGRAL CALCULUS. If we consider the generality of the supposition [1.], which admits any number of arbitrary quantities, it certainly appears remarkable that this equationf . v = 0 should be always verified. ?. 3. Application to the Parabola. If the tangent at the vertex of a parabola be taken for the axis of abscissas, and the semiparameter = 1, then if x be the abscissa, the equation of the curve will be 2 y = 2 and the arc, which may be designated as arc x, dx Vi + x2. The known value of this is [2.] Arcx = 1 xVI+x2 + slog (X + VI +x2). This is a function of x, the properties of which appear to have been hitherto little examined. I will establish two theorems concerning it, which are of considerable simplicity. Theorem I.-If three abscissae are the roots of the equation x rx2 + + I r 0 the sum of the arcs equals the sum of the abscisssw. Since each arc is greater than its corresponding abscissa, it is evident that the word sum is to be understood in an algebraic sense, or that at least one of the arcs must be taken negatively. Theorem II.-.If three abscissc are the roots of the equation x3 x2 + ( b a2a) + 4= O the sum of the arcs equals the product of the abscissce. This theorem is remarkable for its simplicity, when it is considered that it contains two arbitrary quantities, a and b, which, as it appears, may have any values. Demonstration of Theorem I. Put 1 + X2 = X2 + v X + 1: whence F[i. Xx3+2vx2+ (v2+ 1)x+2v=0. Also SdxVL+x2=Sx2dx~vSxdx+Sdxr 8t di x /I + X2 = S 2d + v S x dx + St.x ..SfdxV1I+X2= +fSxdx +Sx. The first term .q + r in all equations. Herep -2 v q =v2 + r = -2 v. MR. TALBOT'S RESEARCHES IN THE INTEGRAL CALCULUS. 7 * * 3 = 3 + 2v 2(v2+ v + 1) -2 ve To find the value of the second termfv S x d x, we have S X2 = p22 q = 4 v2 (2 v2 + 2) 2 v2 2 ., Sxdx = 2vdv and fvSxdx jf2v2dv=Therefore these two terms destroy each other. Consequently we have simply sfdx4/Y2 = Sx + C. It appears by trial that C 0, and the equation between the roots [L.1 becomes, by writing for v its value r , 3r x2+ + I) x-r = O the sum of three arcs = S X = r. O.E.D. Example.-Let us suppose r = 4 + 2 V2 = 6828427. The three roots will be x=1 y = 4*2042580 z = 1-6241690. Calculating the arcs accurately by the formula [2.], we have Arc x = P 147793 Arc y = 10-156004 Arc z = 2K179773 In forming the sum we must notice that arc x and arc z are to be accounted negative. Consequently we find by subtraction, Arcy = 10-156004 Arc x + Arc z = 3327566 Sum = 6,828438 r 6-828427 Error of calculation = 0000011 Thus the calculation verifies the theorem with considerable exactness, and shows that no constant is required to be added to the integral. Since the sum of these three arcs is algebraic, and that each contains a logarithmic part, the sum of these three logarithms must be=I0 for if not, it must be an alge8 MR. TALBOTS RESEARCHES IN THE INTEGRAL CALCULUS. braic quantity, which is considered to be impossible. This is verified by calculation; for 2 arc x = xZ /1 +X2 + log (X + /1 +X2). Calling log (x + 1 + x2) =f. x, we have fx = 0'881372 = 2-143099 fJ = 1261722 fx +fz = 2 143094 2 143094 sum = 0 000005 This sum approaches zero very nearly. The quantitiesf x,fz are subtractive, being parts of 2 arc x and 2 arc z, which have been already shown to be so. Demonstration of Theorem II. Let v/ 2jF7 2= nx2+ x + v, where n is a constant, -2 1 + vn-v% 21v X3 +n2+2 n2 = ?.? and vS./dx2.dx=nSV2dx+ Sxdx, the term v S d x being omitted; because, since S x is constant, the factor S dx = 0. The formula S x3 = p3 3p q + 3 r gives S X3 3p3 ?s y-pq2+r, (observing that p is constant and =S x2 dx + d q + d r. Therefore the first term, or n S x2 dx = 2 d q + n d r. The formula S X = p2 2 q gives the second term, or Sxdx= -dq .nSX2dx + Sxdx= dq + ndr. 013 vSJF Kd x = dq + ndr.

Now writing n--, v b we have the equation in the form given above, viz. X a _ X2 + T-a b ab) X + a2 0;' and therefore the theorem is demonstrated. Examples. Ex. 1. Let a = 2 + 12, r 1, the roots of the equation are x= X=1 .. arc X = P 147793 y= 3906278 .arc y = 8911399 z= 1,492065 . arc z = 1P935186 .Sx 3A414213 2 + /= a and xyz= -(3+2 V 2) -5&828426. Now we have Arcy = 8911399 (1.) Arc x + Arc z = 3082979 (2.) Sum (subtractive) =-5 828420 = (2.) -(1.) xwy z 5-828426 Error 0,000006 The quantity which we previously called f x = log (x + I1+ X2) has the following values* fx = 0 881372 fy= 2-071728 fz = P190354 we havefx +fz = 2-071726 fy = 2'071728 Error 0000002 T~hus it is seen that the logarithmr4ic parts destroy each other as in the first theorem.n MDCCCXXXVH. c 10 MR.

Let x = y = be assumed for two roots of the equation; in which: 45 35 case we finda -6, ab = and the third root z Since xy = I in this example, the theorem gives the sum of three arcs = xy z z= which we propose to verify. Now the formula 2 are x= xVI+ X2 log (V+ VI +X2) gives (3 1.5 2 arc (4) 6 + log 2 2 arc() = + log3 the sum of which two =45 + log 6 35 1295 and 2 are (1)-14 + log 6* ~~~~F 144 +o6 Therefore the, sum (subtractive) 840 70 144 le ..arcx+arcy-arcz= F But on the other hand we have 0, Therefore the sum of the arcs = z: which was to be shown. ? 4. Analogous Properties of the Circle and Parabola. There is a manifest analogy between the area of the circle and the arc of the parae bola, the former being expressed by fdIx l _x2, the latter byfdVI +x2, which only differ in the sign. The same analogy is seen in the theorems which may be deduced respecting these integrals. Thus, for instance, the Theorem II., which we have demonstrated in the parabola, may be applied, with a slight modification, to the circle. If we put v V/I ?x 2= n V2 + X + V, we find the sum of three integrals of the form fd VlIx2 = r, the constant being = 0. The upper sign applies to the parabola, the lower to the circle. The demonstration of the latter case is omitted for brevity, being exactly similar to that of the former. MR. TALBOT S RESEARCHES IN THE INTEGRAL CALCULUS. 1i The three variables x y z are roots of 1.] X3 -ax2 + b a2b 0 the upper sign applying to the parabola; a and b being two arbitrary quantities. To exemplify this theorem in the circle.-Since 2fdvd x -.x2 XSI x _2 + arc sin x, the theorem gives 2 r S X VI X2 + S arc sin w. The latter term, being the sum of three circular arcs, cannot form any part of the quantity 2 r: therefore we must have this other equation, S arc sin x = 0, which we propose to verify. Ex. 1. Suppose a = 6, b = -, the equation [1.] becomes 63 6 27 12 and its roots are 4 a,_5 y=1 X _T 5 :.arc sin x=53' 8'= O arc sin y = 90? = O' arc sin z 143? 8' _ 0' 0 + 0' + 0"f = 0,7 in accordance with the theorem. We may assume two of the arcs arbitrarily, and thence determine the third, so as to satisfy the theorem. 4 12 56 12 EX. 2. Thus, let x = , y = we finda= a , -. LHere it happens that X y b = -: therefore, dividing the equation a' b xy7 = by the equation ab we find the third root z = a. c 2 12 MR. TALBOTS RESEARCHES IN THE INTEGRAL CALCULUS,, Now these three values satisfy the theorem; for we have .4 arc sin s 530 8' = 0 arc sin = 670 23' 4' .56 -arc sin= 120? 31' 0" and d + o' + "f = 0. ? 5. Application to the Ellipse. In order to obtain a relation between three elliptic integrals, the simplest supposition which we can make appears to be X 12 =-V x+ whence 3 + Q , -2 + Qe v . 0. x3y2 V XV~0 This determines the value of the symmetrical v to be =r and therefore making this substitution we have x3 + r x2 + (14 e . r = 0 and V+-e:e2 x whence Sdx\,/l r S dx + S dd . But since SX2=p2 2~2~( r2-~2)=ij0U2?-2 Stz p 2 q r ( .r 2 1+ e2 Svdx=rdr .-.rS xcd x (1 +e2)dr. Also Sdx= dr r Sxdx+Sdx e2 dr .SdxV e = e2dr w1es x2 ed/i -Oe 2 r +C MR. TALBOT'S RESEARCHES IN THE INTEGRAL CALCULUS. 13 Or, if we suppose the radical to have a negative sign, Pd$ X l _ = C-e2r; whence the following theorem: If three abscissce of an ellipse are roots of the equation s + r x2 + (1 . e r2I 1 -r =-0 the sum of the arcs 2 Q e2 r, Q being the quadrant of the ellipse. Ex. I. Let e 0. or the ellipse be a circle; the theorem then assumes this form: If three abscissce of a circle are roots of the equation X3 + r x2 + ( x r-O, the sum of the arcs is a semicircle; the truth of which has been demonstrated previously (vide page 4.). FAGNANI'S theorem becomes illusory when e = 0: it is therefore interesting to obhserve that the present theorem, on the contrary, has a real application to the circle. Ex. 2. Let e have any value, and r = 0 then the roots are x=O ..arcx=0-? (1.) Y_1 arCy-Q=Q(2.) Z =arc z=Q(3.) and the sum, viz. (1) + (2.)-(3.) = 2 Q, whiCh is therefore the value of the constant. Ex. 3. When x is not actually = 0, as in the last example, but has an indefinitely small value = c), it will be found that the values of y and z differ from 1 and 1 by a quantity of the order of &j2. But nevertheless the arcs which subtend these abscissa differ from a quadrant of the ellipse by a quantity of the order of w. This arises from the direction of the arC at the extremities of the axis being perpendicular to the abscissa, so that its increment is infinitely greater than that of the latter. It will be well to show the truth of the theorem in this case. When x = c' we have (putting 1-e2 b2) 62 cv2 y= 1z =-yi. For from these values we deduce y + z = 0, and thence (neglecting quantities of the order aJ3) X + Y + Z = X = xy+xz+yz~yz=-y2= _1 So ta xZy Z = rot 4 So tat y z re oot of 14 MR. TALBOT'S RESEARCHES IN THE INTEGRAL CALCULUS, 3-V2 + (1 2 _ I) X + = Xwhich agrees with the given form by putting r . We have now to find the sum of the arcs. The arc subtending the abscissa (x = a) may be considered as equal to it. The arc subtending the abscissa y differs from the elliptic quadrant by an ace which may be considered equal to the ordinate which corresponds to y. And the, same with respect to z. Let y' be the ordinate corresponding to y. The equation of the curve gives = bV1-y2; but since 2 b2W 2 b , 6o b2 Y2 4 *@/=2 Y 3 62 and the arc subtendingy =Q The arc z has the same value. Therefore arcy + arc z = 2 Q -b2 adding arc x = w, we have Sum of arcs 2 Q + e2 a, (or, since c = r) 2 Q e2r, in accordance with the theorem. 2 Ex. 4. Let 1-e2 =. And also let r = 9 31/i = 04868331; the roots of the equation x3 + rx2 + ( -) x-r=O are x = 05 =sin 30 Y= 0,98019 = sin 78? 34' z = 0@99336 = sin 830 24' Entering LEGENDRE'S Table IX. with modulus e = 4 = sin 540 44' and these amplitudes, we find arc x = 0O5081 arcy = 11446 arc z = 11944 Sum 2'8471 MR. TALBOT'S RESEARCHES IN THE INTEGRAL CALCULUS. 15 On the other hand we have 2 Q= 2 are (900) _25224 e2 r 0'3246 2 Q e2 r = 28470 Sum of arcs 28471 Error = 000001 I will now indicate two other theorems respecting the sum of three elliptic arcs. I. We may put the integralfd dx /1I_ in the form f (1 +ex) dx c e x) (1-x2)) and assume(1 + ex)(1 g to be a symmetrical= v. This gives X3 Jr e 2 (V + l) X + v 0 O and the result which I find is, that if three abscissa are the roots of this equation, the sum of the corresponding arcs = 2 eV -b+ C. II. We may put the integral in the form (1 + x) (1 e2.x2) and assume I = v, whence +3 + -2 v + v 0. The result which I find is, that if three abscissa are the roots of this equation, the, sumi of the arcs = 2 ..b/v+ C. These theorems respecting the sums of elliptic arcs appear to be some of the simplest which exist; but an unlimited number of theorems of a higher order and more complicated nature are obtainable, the discussion of which would lead too far at present. Thus if we assume V I .j ani X X +Xan-2 X + &c. where the coefficients are constants, or entire rational functions of v, we have an equation of 2 n dimensions, which gives the sum of 2 n elliptic arcs in terms of v. There is no difficulty, beyond the length of the operation, in deducing these theoremns, as they are all obtainable by an uniform method. But it will be of iinportance to show the relation between them and the previously received doctrines respecting elliptic integrals as established by LEGENDRE and others, the connexion between them not being at first sight very evident. 16 MR. TALBOT'S RESEARCHES IN THE INTEGRAL CALCULUS. ? 6. Application to the Equ'lateral IHyperbola. In order to obtain a relation between three values of the integral f V + 4 which expresses the arc of the equilateral hyperbola, we may put 4/1 + 4 V + 1, whence 3v2x 2 v = 0, we have therefore 2 v = r, and making this substitution, V3-e 0. Also 4/1 + X4 r 1 S _ _ + _ X X X2~~ .. S4/1yt .4drSd S w 2 +27Z -.

It will be seen how very simply and directly we are conducted to it by the present method of investigation. Next let us suppose -VI +aA-VX3? +I whence Q 8_ 2 + V = VtSV Put v=-* Philosophica Transactions, 1836' Part I. p. 185d MR.

We will now suppose _ 41p H + a +.P a being a constant. This gives a3 + ? , V2 + v + _ 2 a '0'' Q and I find this result, that if three abscissae are roots of this equation, which may be written 3 _p x2 + q x -r 0, then the sum of the arcs tV2 =P r + constL pv + C. This sum is therefore constant if v v is so. Let v-k, v = ', be two values of v, which give the same value to p v, or p -\' Let the three hyperbolic arcs in the first case be a a' a", and in the second case (3 (3' (3", then a + a, + al" + Pt'+ PI". All the abscissae have the same origin at the centre of the curve, therefore the arcs have the same origin, and therefore can be subtracted from one another. Therefore putting a -(=y, a'-3'r', At/ -( 3r" we have r + r' + r" 0. This appears to me to show the possibility of finding three arcs such that (neglecting MDcccxxxvII. D i18 MR. TALBOT9S RESEARCHES IN THE INTEGRAL CALCULUS. their signs) the sum of two of them shall be equal to the third (though not superposable in any part). I believe that it has been hitherto held that this equality is impossible in the ellipse and hyperbola, without the addition of some algebraic quantity. I should have wished therefore to have added some numerical illustration of such a result, but the length of the calculation has hitherto prevented me fromn doing so.
