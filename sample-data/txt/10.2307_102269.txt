T H E P R E F A C E. THE Philosophical Transactions having been for several Months omitted,the Royal Society commanded me, some time since, to take care to continue them, which has been done by the Publication of this Volume. I am very sensible there are too many Errata's to be found in them, some of which being very material, are taken Notice of at the end of several of them, which the Reader is desired to correct. The Variety of Matter, Characters and Translators have been chiefly the Cause of these Mistakes; and perhaps considerable ones may have escaped, occasioned by my necessary Attendance on my Profession, which has sometimes hindered me from taking due Care to revise the Press, whereby the Sense has been perverted in some Places. I could have wish'd to have been able to have given a larger and better Account of Books lately Printed, But that requiring more time than I could well spare, I have been forc'd to get their Extracts that appear here, to be mostly done by other Hands, to whom the Publick are indebted.
