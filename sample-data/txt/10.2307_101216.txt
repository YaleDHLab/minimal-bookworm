Account of a great number of Stones, found in one Bladder, by the same. Mr. Goodrick Chirurgeon of Bury St. Edmunds affirm'd to me, that himself Cutting a Lad of the Stone (for which he hath a great name) took out thence, at one time, 96 small Stones, all of them of unlike shape, Size, Corners, Sides; some of which were so bestow'd as to slide upon others, and had thereby worn their flats to a wonderfull slikness. He assur'd me also,that in the same place, another, when dead, had a Stone taken from him, almost as big as a new-born Childs head, and much of that Shape.
