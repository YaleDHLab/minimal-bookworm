An Explanation, necessary to justify the Geography supposed in these Letters. IT may seem wonderful, that the Author of these Letters makes mention in his former, of a kind of Warr between the Oriental Tartars and the Moscovites, notwithstanding the extream distance, these People appear to be from one another in our Geographical Charts; but those who know how much the Moscovites have extended the Bounds of the Empire along the Tartarian Sea, will judge the thing less difficult, besides those who have seen these Countrys, have made Discoveries much differing from those which our Geographers have informed us of hitherto. Very lately Monseiur D' Arcy, who commands one of the Kings Ships, in the Fleet of Monseiur Le Marescal d Estrees, informed us, that having served in Poland, and having been made Governor of a Place towards Moscovy, the Moscovite Ambassadors in their returne having passed by him, and being by him, treated in such a manner as put them into a very good Humor; one of them shewed him a Chart of the Countrys between ~vy and China: and told him, that from 3 Citys which he shewed him, whose Names were Lopsla, Abasinko, Nerginsko, all 3 under the Government of the great Dukes, tho' Situated in the great Tartary, there was a Way to Pekin, which [63] which was not more than 25 or 30 dayes Journey. This Map it seems must be kept very Secret in Muscovy: for rhe next Day the Muscovite was in dispair, for having given it, saying that if it should be known he should come to great Dammage. The Officer being come back since into France, has given a Copy to the King, and another to Monsieur Le Marquis de Seignelay. To confirme this it may be added, what a French Man has writ from Muscovy within this two Monthes, that they are actually Raising Troops, to go to War with the Chinese.
