Observation of a Parhelion, Oct. 26th, 1721. By the same. T H I S Morning, 26th of October, being on the River coming up to London, about half an Hour past Ten, the Sun being then about twenty Degrees high, I observed a Circle about the Sun, which is by no means unusual, when the Air in chilly Weather, such as it is now, is replete with snowy Particles; which Circle was of the Size it always appears in, about 23 Degrees from the Sun, and faintly ting'd with the Colours of the Iris. When this Circle happens, I always look out, to see whether any other of the Phenomena that sometimes attend it did at that Time appear, such as Parhelia, and other colour'd Circles, concentrick with the Sun, and sometimes, as once I saw it, excentrick; as also a white Circle round the Zenith, in equal Altitude with the Sun: But this Time, the Air being thickned with a hazy Vapour, and the Smoke of the Town, I could only see to the Eastward a luminous white Patch, which for about twenty Minutes shone through the thick Air very conspicuously, of about two Degrees diameter, as near as I could estimate it, and about the same Altitude with the Sun: and from it, towards the Sun, there seemed to proceed a long G g 2 white (212) white Tail, much narrower than the Mock-Sun, but which I took to be a Segment of the white Circle which I once saw entire in London. Had the Air been clear, I doubt not but much more of the Phenomena of the Parhelia might this Time have been observed: and I hope, that from our Neighbourhood some Member of the Society may furnish us with a fuller Relation. But how to explain these Appearances, and account for the Magnitude of these Circles, is what seems still wanting.
