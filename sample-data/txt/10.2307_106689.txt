[157] XIV. An Account of a Monster of the human Species, in two Letters; one from Baron Reichel to Sir Joseph Banks, Bart~ and the other from Mr. James Anderson to Baron Reichel. Communicated by Sir Joseph Banks, Bart. P. R. S. Read April 30, 1789. TO SIR JOSEPH BANKS, BART. S I R, I H A V E the pleasure to transmit to you the portrait of a Gentoo boy, an astonishing living subject, who being sent to me by a friend of mine residing in the environs of the native place of the boy, I made two drawings representing the alternate attitudes in which he can place half the body of his little brother, who adheres to his breast. See Tab. II. PERUNTALOO is a handsome well-made lad, possessing every due faculty of mind and body, rather more sagacious, and with a superior share of understanding, than young men in general of his age. In addition to the inclosed anatomical description of the boy by Mr. ANDERSON, you will observe in the drawings two circular dotted lines, about the lower part of the loins of the semi~monster. During the several sittings I had of PERUNTALOO, I observed an internal motion about these parts rather more conspicuous than any other of the body; and upon questioning the youth, he shewed me, that by retaining his breath, he could force a current of air into them, so as to swell the parts like two blownup bladders, with a rumbling noise at the time of action. Whether there is a connection with the lungs of PERUNTALOO is V O L. LXXIX. C c a question Fort St. George, Feb. 28, 1788. 158 Baron Reichel's Account of a a question I cannot venture to determine; Mr. ANDERSON, however, thinks it well worth my mentioning this observation. The erection of the little penis in the semi-monster, and the command PERUNTALOO has of discharging the urine through it, are perfectly ascertained. Such as this subject is, if with any merit, you may depend upon the correctness of the drawings. I am, &c. T. REICHEL. TO BARON REICHEL. S I R, A S you mean to send the elegant drawing of PERUNTALOO to Sir JOSEPH BANKS, you may acquaint him from me, that the little brother is suspended by the os pubis; an elongation of the sword-like cartilage of PERUNTALOO having anastomosed with that bone at the symphysis. Fort St. George, Feb. 25, 1788. The lower orifice of the stomach seems to lie in the sac or cylindrical cavity between the two brothers on the right-side, and what may be reckoned the right hypochondre of the little one, as that part is tumid and full after eating. The alimentary canal must be common to both, as the anus of the little one is imperforate. There is a bladder of urine distinctly perceived, which occupies the left side of the sac, or left hypochondre of the monster. Besides which, there remain only the sacrum, ossa innominata, and lower extremities perfect. PERUNTALOO Philos. Trans. Vol. LXXIX. Tab. II. p. 160. ~. Fig.2. Drawn from life at Madras,28th.Oct.1789,by T.Reichel Monster of the human Species. 159 PERUNTALOO says he has as complete a sense of feeling with every part of the body of his little brother as of his own proper body, and this may account for the erections you saw, and making water distinctly; but this volition does not extend to the legs or feet, which are cold in comparison with the rest. I am, &c. JAMES ANDERSON. E X P L A N A T I O N O F T H E P L A T E. PERUNTALOO, son of CHINDRAHPAH-NAYANDOO, of the Gentoo Cast. He was born at Popelpahdoo, 70 miles west from Musilipatnam. He is 13 years of age, and measures 4 feet 61/2 inches in height. Fig. 1. Natural position. Fig. 2. Reversed position. C c 2
