[424] XLII. Observations on the Difference between the Duration of Human Life in Towns and in Country Parishes and Villages. By the Rev. Richard Price, D. D. F. R. S. Communicated by Dr. Horsley. THIS Society has lately been much obliged to Dr. PERCIVAL, for the accounts he has communicated of the state of population at Manchester and its adjacent places. These accounts contain some facts, which appear to me curious and important. From the last in particular, there appears to be reason for concluding, that whereas a 28th part of the inhabitants die annually in the town of Manchester, not more than a 56th part die annually in the adjacent country. This implies a difference so great between the rates of human mortality in these different situations, that some, whose judgements I reverence, have thought it incredible. I will, therefore, beg leave to offer the following observations on this subject. Redde, June, 22, 1775. In the first place, the evidence in this instance is such as seems to leave little room for doubt. From an accurate survey it appears, that the number of inhabitants in the town was 27246, in the year 1773. The number of deaths the same year (and also the average for 1772, 1773, [425] 1773, and 1774), was 973 (a); that is, a 28th part of the number of inhabitants. From an equally careful survey it appears, that the number of inhabitants in that part of the parish of Manchester which lies in the country, was 13786. The number of deaths in 1772 was 246; that is, a 56th part of the number of inhabitants. The chief objection to this evidence is, that the number of deaths in that part of the parish which lies in the country is given only for one year; whereas the average of several years ought to be given. But first, the number of deaths in 1772, in the town, was nearly the same with the medium for seven years; and from hence there arises a probability, that in the adjacent country, the number of deaths, in the same year, could not have been much lower than the medium. Secondly, supposing it lower, there is the highest probability, that it was not more than a 4th or 5th lower. Suppose then the true annual medium to be 300, instead of 246, and it will follow, that whereas a 28th part of the inhabitants die in the town annually, a 46th part die in the country; and this is a difference very considerable. But farther, I would (a) The numbers of burials in the town, including the addition of 50 every year for dissenters, was in 1772, 954 1773, 973 1774, 1008 Within the parish, but out of the town, there are 13 episeopal and dissenting chapels; and the number of burials in all these chapels, in 1772, was 246. The christenings were 401. The number of burials brought from the country into the town is not considerable; and it is, I am informed, pretty exactly balanced by the burials carried out of the town into the country. L l l 2 observe [426] observe, that the difference which this survey gives between the rate of mortality in the town of Manchester and the adjacent country, is confirmed by a variety of other accounts. It may be stated in general, that whereas in great towns, the proportion of inhabitants dying annually is from 1 in 19 to 1 in 22 or 23, and in moderate towns from 1 in 24 to 1 in 28 (b); in country parishes and villages on the contrary, this proportion seldom exceeds 1 in 40 or 50. The proofs of this are numerous and unexceptionable; and I have elsewhere given a particular account of them (c). I will here only mention the following facts. The number of inhabitants at STOCKHOLM in 1763 was 72979. The average of deaths for the six preceding years had been 3802 (d). One, therefore, in nineteen died there annually. At (b) The number dying annually in towns is seldom so low as 1 in 28, except in consequence of a rapid increase produced by an influx of people, at those periods of life when the fewest die. This is the case at Manchester. It is also the case at Liverpool and at Berlin; in the former of which towns, 1 in 27 dies annually; and in the latter, 1 in 261/2 died from 1755 to 1759. See Observations on Reversionary Payments, p. 224, &c. 3d edition. (c) See Observations on Reversionary Payments, &c. Essay 1st, and Supplement. (d) See a Memoir by M. WARGENTIN, in the 15th volume of the Collection Academique, printed at Paris, 1772. From this memoir I learn, that in 1757, and 1760, and 1763, a survey was made of the inhabitants of Sweden, distinguishing, particularly, the numbers of both sexes living at every age; and that also, for nine years (or from 1755 to 1763), an exact register was kept of the number of births and burials in each year, distinguishing the age and sex of every one that died. I do not know whether this regulation has been continued to [427] At ROME, all account is taken every year of the number of inhabitants; and, in the year 1771, it was 159675. The average of deaths for ten years had been 7367: one, therefore, in 211/2 died annually. In LONDON I have shewn, with an evidence which I think little short of demonstration, that at least 1 in 203/4 of the inhabitants die annually (e). And, from a particular survey and a very accurate register of mortality at NORTHAMPTON, it appears, that 1 in 261/2 die there annually. Let these facts be compared with the following. In 1767, a survey was made of the inhabitants of the island of MADEIRA, under the direction of Dr. THOMAS HEBERDEN, and their number was found to be 64614. The average of burials for eight preceding years had been 1293. Only 1 in 50, therefore, of the inhabitants died annually (see Philosophical Transactions, vol. LVII. p. 461.). to the present time; but the result of it, for the nine years I have mentioned, as given by M. WARGENTIN in this Memoir, contains indeed a most curious account of the state of population in Sweden; and it is particularly to my present purpose to mention, that it shews, that though a 19th part of the inhabitants of Stockholm die every year, yet in the whole kingdom, taking all the towns and country together, not more than a 35th part die every year. In 1757, Sweden consisted of 1101595 males and 1221600 females; in 1760, of 1121053 males and 1246445 females; and in 1763, of 1165489 males and 1280905 females. The annual average of births, from 1755 to 1763, was 46223 males and 44017 females; of marriages, 21219; of deaths, 34088 males and 35037 females. (e) See Observations on Reversionary Payments, Essay IV. p. 253, &c. The [428] The district of VAUD, in Switzerland, in 1766, contained 112951 inhabitants. The average of deaths for ten preceding years had been 2504. Only 1 in 45, therefore, died annually (f). The number of inhabitants in the parish of ACKWORTH, in the county of York, in 1757, was 603; and the average of deaths for ten years had been 107/10, or a 56th part. In 1767, the inhabitants were increased to 728; and the annual average of deaths was 153/10, or nearly a 47th part (g). The reason of this striking difference between the rate of human mortality in towns and in country parishes and villages must be, first, the luxury and the irregular modes of life which prevail in towns; and, secondly, the foulness of the air. But it has been inquired, whether the migrations of people from the country to towns may not produce this difference, by lessening the proportion of inhabitants that die in the country, and increasing the same proportion in towns? In answer to this enquiry I would observe: first, that this difference being a difference of near a half, it is apparently much greater than can be accounted for by any such cause. But, secondly, it should be consi(f) See M. MURET'S Memoir on the State of Population, in the Pays de Vaud, printed at Bern, in 1766; and the Supplement to the Observations on Reversionary Payments, p. 358. 3d edit. (g) I owe this information concerning the parish of Ackworth to a curious register kept there by Dr. LEE. I have taken the liberty to insert this register in the postscript, together with the annual register and survey of Rome from 1762 to 1771. 2 dered, [429] dered, that if migrations lessen the number of deaths, they also lessen the number of inhabitants; and that it depends intirely on the ages at which the inhabitants remove from a place, whether the effect of their removal shall be lowering or raising the proportion of the annual deaths to the number of inhabitants. In the present case, the truth appears to be, that the most common age of migration from the country is such as raises this proportion in the country. This will be evident from the following considerations. The period of life in which persons remove from the country to settle in towns, is chiefly the beginning of mature life, or from the age of 10 or 15 to 25 or 30. In infancy, none migrate; and in the decline of life, it is more usual to retire from towns than to remove to them. Towns, therefore, will be inhabited more by people in the firmest parts of life; and, on the other hand, the country will be inhabited more by people in the weakest parts of life; and the consequence of this is, that in the country, the inhabitants must die faster in proportion to their number than they otherwise would, and that in towns they must die more slowly. In particular, the number of children is always much greater in the country than in towns; and this is a circumstance which must be extremely unfavourable to the former: for it is well known, that there are no years of life, in which so many of a given number die, as the first three or four years. Till the age of five, human life, like a fire beginning to burn, is very feeble; and in some situations more than half, and in others, a third or fourth of all that are born die before that age. After this, life grows [430] grows less and less precarious till it acquires its utmost vigour at 10 or 15; and of the living at this age, not above 1 in 70 or 80 dies annually in the worst situations; and in the best situations, not above 1 in 150 or 160. After 15, life declines, and continues to do so more and more, till it becomes quite extinct in old age. If, therefore, in any situation, the inhabitants consist more of persons in mature life, and yet die faster, it must be owing to some particular causes of mortality that operate there. This is the case in all towns where any observations have been made. Manchester, in particular, is not only kept up, but increases fast, by removals to it of persons in the prime of life. The country round it increases likewise; but it is by an excess of the births above the deaths; that is, by accessions to it of children in the very feeblest part of life. This ought to raise the proportion of annual deaths to inhabitants in the country, much above the same proportion in the town; but, instead of this, it is near one-half lower. It may be needless to add any thing to these observations. In order, however, to put this matter out of all doubt, I will observe farther, that it appears in fact, from the accounts furnished by Dr. PERCIVAL, that the number of inhabitants in the periods of life when mankind die fastest (b) (that is, in the first and last stages of life), is con(n) In towns, about a fourth of the inhabitants die commonly between 14 and 51; a fifth or sixth die at 51 and upwards; and the remainder die under 15. In country parishes and villages about a fifth die between 14 and 51; about two-fifths at 51 and upwards; and the remainder under 15. siderably [431] siderably less in the town of Manchester than in the adjacent country. The number of inhabitants in the town, under 15 and above 50, is 13467; in the country, 7305. And the whole number is, in the town, 27246; in the country, 13786. In the town, therefore, the inhabitants, in the first and last stages of life, do not make half the whole number; but in the country, they make considerably more than half. At Ackworth, likewise, in Yorkshire, the inhabitants under 15 and above 50 are more than half the whole number; and the same is true at Hale near Altringham, at Horwich, at Darwen near Blackburn in Lancashire, and at Cockey Moor(i) near Bolton. (i) I am much indebted to Dr. PERCIVAL for the following account of these places. The society belonging to the chapel at Hale is composed of 140 males, 136 females, 92 married persons, 8 widowers, 12 widows, 105 under 15, and 41 above 50. The deaths, during seven years, have been 28, and the births 68. Mr. EVANS'S congregation at Horwich, consists of 305 individuals; viz. 149 males, 156 females, 94 married persons, 9 widowers, 8 widows, 127 under 15 years of age, and 50 above 50. The births, for seven years, 101; the deaths 32. A 66th part, therefore, die annually in both these places. The rev. Mr. SMALLEY'S congregation at Darwent, consists of 1850 individuals; viz. 900 males, 950 females, 640 married persons, 30 widowers, 48 widows, 737 persons under the age of 15, and 218 above 50. During the last seven years the births have amounted to 508, the deaths to 233. A 56th part, therefore, die annually. Mr. BARNES'S congregation at Cockey Moor, consists of 154 families and 711 individuals; namely, 320 males, 391 females, 248 married persons, 10 widowers, 27 widows, 252 persons under the age of 15, and 99 above 50. Deaths in seven years 114; in which period the deaths were considerably increased by an uncommon fatality of the small-pox. One person in 44 died annually. The rev. Mr. MERCER'S congregation at Chowbent, in Lancashire, consists of 1160 persons; viz. 554 males, 606 females, 173 males and 150 females under the age of ten, 83 V O L. LXV. M m m males [432] Bolton, in the same county; and yet in some of these places it appears, that not a 60th part of the inhabitants die annually. At Stockholm, in 1763, the inhabitants under the age of 5, were only a 12th; above 70, only a 46th part of the whole number. But in all Sweden,the number under 5 was a 7th; and above 70, near the 32d part of all the inhabitants: and yet 35 die in the town to 19 in the whole kingdom. This may be easily deduced from Mr. WARGENTIN'S tables in the Collection Academique before quoted. To the accounts which give the proportion of inhabitants to annual deaths so high as 50 or 60 to 1, it has been farther objected, that if true, it must follow, that in such situations half the inhabitants must live to 50 or 60 years of age. But were this a right inference, there would be nothing in it incredible. For though in most cities one-half die in the first two or three years after birth; yet, in many country situations, the greater part live to marry: and in the parish of Ackworth, particularly, it appears with undeniable evidence from the register, that one-half of all born there live to the age of 46. It appears also, with equal evidence, from M. MURET'S tables in the Bern Memoirs for 1766, that in 43 parishes in the district of Vaud, one-half of all born there males and 91 females above 50, 398 married persons, 26 widowers, and 43 widows. The baptisms during six years, wanting six weeks, have amounted to 293, and the deaths to 169. One person, therefore, in 41 died annually. These surveys were made in the year 1773. live [433] live beyond the age of 41. In truth, did all mankind lead natural and virtuous lives, that waste of the species which happens in infancy and childhood would not take place, and few would die except in old age. The inference, however, which I have mentioned, cannot be made with reason. It is just only in the particular case of an uniform decrease in the probabilities of living from birth to old age; and this is a case that has never existed. In all other cases, there is not any necessary connexion between the proportion of inhabitants dying annually, and the age to which the greater part live. In most cities one-half, as I have just observed, of all that are born die before two or three years of age. But it cannot be imagined, that there is any place where so many as onehalf or a third of the inhabitants die every year. But to return to Dr. PERCIVAL'S account of the town and parish of Manchester. It appears from this account, that the number of children under 15, compared with the number of inhabitants between 14 and 51, is greater in the country than in the town of Manchester, in the proportion of no less than 5 to 4 (k). It follows, therefore, that though, in consequence of a constant influx of people to the town, it is more filled than the country with (k) In the town, the number of inhabitants between 14 and 51 is 13779; and 9575 under 15. In the country, the former number is 6481; and the latter, 5545. But the last number would have been only 4503, had the proportion of the inhabitants between 14 and 51 to the inhabitants under 15 been the same in both situations. It is owing to this, that the number of persons in a family in the country is 51/2; but in the town only 41/4. M m m 2 inha [434] inhabitants in the most vigorous periods of life; yet one child in four less is born in the town than in the country. This is a remarkable circumstance, and the reasons of it must be the two following. First, the town inhabitants being less healthy, and dying faster, have not the same strength of constitution with the country inhabitants. Secondly, in the town a smaller proportion of the adult inhabitants marry; and they marry later than in the country. The survey fully proves this; for it appears, that though the number of inhabitants at the most common marrying ages, compared with the whole number of the living above the age of 14, is smaller in the country than the town; yet the proportion of the married to the living above 14, is very nearly the same in both situations. And there are more widows and widowers in the town than in the country in the proportion of near 16 to 11. We learn from hence, I think, clearly in what manner towns operate in checking population, and preventing the increase of mankind. Dr. PERCIVAL informs us, that the reverend and learned Dr. TUCKER has been led, by some observations he has made at Bristol, to doubt whether the common opinion is right, with respect to the disproportion between the number of male and female births; and that he, therefore, wishes a farther inquiry may be made into this subject. This has induced me to collect the following facts, which, I think, will abundantly settle this point. In [435] Born Males. Females. Proportion. In London for the last 110 years, or from 1664 862293 817072 20 to 19 to 1773, Paris, for 8 years (l), 79693 76481 25 to 24 Leyden, for 50 years (m), 46773 44933 26 to 25 Vienna, for 27 years, ending 1746 (n), 67060 64893 31 to 30 Berlin, for 40 years, ending 1761 (o), 71188 67431 20 to 19 Kurmark of Brandenburgh, for 9 years, ending 102425 96521 18 to 17 1759 (p), Dukedom of Magdeburgh, for 38 years, ending 153227 145985 21 to 20 1759 (q), All the Prussian towns, for a course of years, (r), 691826 659072 21 to 20 In a great number of country parishes, for a 59067 56282 21 to 20 course of years (s), In the same country parishes, for another period 89530 84954 19 to 18 of years (t), Leeds, Manchester, Coventry, &c. for a period 108784 103449 20 to 19 of years (u), In the same towns, for another period (x), 57084 54128 20 to 19 Total, 2388950 2271201 20 to 19 Sweden, for 9 years, ending 1763, 416007 396124 20 to 19 Mr. DERHAM, in his Physico-Theology, p. 175. has stated the proportion of male to female births at 14 to 13, and this proportion has ever since been generally received as the true one; but it appears from this table, that it ought to have been stated at 20 to 19. But though it appears, that the number of males born is in this proportion greater than the number of females born, yet, in most places, the number of males living has been (l) See SUSM.

(u) Ibid. p. 49. (x) Ibid. p.. found [436] found to be less than the number of females. The reason is, without doubt, that males are more short-lived than females; and this is owing partly to the peculiar hazards to which males are subject, and their more irregular modes of life; but it is owing principally to some particular delicacy in the male constitution, which renders it less durable: for there are many observations which prove, that the greater mortality of males takes place chiefly in the first and last stages of life. A few facts of this kind I will beg leave to mention, because I have just met with them. In the parish of St. Sulpice, at Paris, during 30 years, 5 males under a year old died to 4 females. But under 10, only 13 males died to 12 females (see SUSMILCH. Tables, vol. II. p. 30.) In Stockholm, during 9 years ending in 1763, the number of still-borns amounted to 666; of whom 390 were males, and 276 females; that is, 10 to 7. The number of the living in the town above the age of 80 was, in 1760, 332; of whom 248 were females, and 84 males, or near 3 to 1. In the whole kingdom of Sweden, including all town and country inhabitants, the number of still-borns, during the 9 years just mentioned, was 19845; of whom 11424 were males, and 8421 females, or near 4 to 3. The number of the living in the whole kingdom consisted of more females than males, in the proportion of 10 to 9. It consisted of more females turned of 80 than males, in the proportion of 33 to 19; and of more females turned of 90 than males in the proportion [437] portion of near 2 to 1. (See M. WARGENTIN'S Memoir in the Collection Academique, vol. XV.) Having now had occasion to refer again to this Memoir, I will just add, that it appears, that by the excess of the births above the deaths, Sweden gains every year an addition of above 20000 inhabitants; and that in six years they increased from 2323195 to 2446394. I am afraid, were regulations established for a similar inquiry in this kingdom, we should be far from finding our state so encouraging. London alone is a gulph which swallows up an increase equal to near three-fourths of that of Sweden. P O S T S C R I P T. The following tables have been selected from several more of the same kind in M. WARGENTIN'S Memoir on the state of population in Sweden. I have inserted them here, because they fully verify most of the observations in the preceding paper, and contain more distinct and authentic information on the subject of human mortality than I have ever before met with.

Between 5 and 10 Stockholm begins to receive recruits from the country, and they come in faster and faster till 35; after which age it appears, that more die than come in; and that the living in every subsequent period goes on decreasing continually till the end of life. It is farther observable, that this table exhibits a greater difference than the former, between the mortality of males and females. A comparison of these tables will shew a striking contrast in other respects between the state of human mortality in the whole kingdom of Sweden and in its capital. In order to make this more obvious and unexceptionable, I will add the following table, deduced from all M. WARGENTIN'S tables taken together. N n n 2 T A B L L E [442] T A B L E III.
