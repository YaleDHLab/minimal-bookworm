[ 653 ] XIV. On the Sextactic Points of a Plane Curve. BY WILLIAM SPOTTISWOODE, M.A., F.R.S., &c. Received June 15,-Read June 15, 1865. THE beautiful equation given by Professor CAYLEY (Proceedings of the Royal Society, vol. xiii. p. 553) for determining the sextactic points of a plane curve, and deduced, as I understand, by the method of his memoir " On the Conic of Five-pointic Contact" (Philosophical Transactions, vol. cxlix. p. 371), led me to inquire how far the formulae of my own memoir " On the Contact of Curves" (Philosophical Transactions, vol. clvii. p. 41) were applicable to the present problem. The formulae in question are briefly as follows: If U=O be the equation of the curve, H= 0 that of its Hessian, and V-=(a, b, c, , g, h)Qc, y, Z)2=0 that of the conic of five-pointic contact; and if, moreover a, 3, r being arbitrary constants, axd [3y +rz, y. (I) then, writing as usual aXU=U, byU=v, -bzU=w; bxH=_p, ~bH=q, agll=r, a6,u _t6 .... YZ) aU=d, 'a . 2H =pi ..........H. BYZ=Pi,..t(2 2 --lto /2o* *fiv'w @-u1u',** vr-wi3=?x, wc 7-uy=, u/3-vx=,! the values of the ratios a: 6: c : if: g: h are determined by the equations V=0 EIV0,T C'V= 0, E3V=0, C'V=0. . . . . . (3) Now, if at the point in question the curvature of U be such that a sixth consecutive point lies on the conic Yan the point is called a sextactic poinlt; and the condition for this will be (in terms of the above formulae) LI V=0. From the six equations V=0, C Vz -0,. . C 'V=0, the quantities a, 6, c, If, g, h can be linearly eliminated; and the result will be an equation which, when combined with U =0, will determine the ratios x : ~y: z, the coordinates of the sext~actic points of U. But the equation so derived contains (beside other extraneous factors) the indeterminate quantities a, /3, r, to the degree 15, which consequently remain to be eliminated. Instead therefore of proceeding as above, I eliminate ex, /3, y beforehand, in such a way that (W=0 representing any one of the series V= 0, C V=0, . . from which ox, /3, y have been already MDcccLxv. 4 X 654 MR.

(n-2) . All these forms, however, contain extraneous factors, the determination of which is the object of the remainder of the paper. The third section is devoted to the establishment of some formulae of reduction, the demonstrations of which are rather too long to be conveniently inserted in what would otherwise be their more natural place (? 4). Besides these I have established many others of a like nature; but the specimens here given will doubtless suffice to suggest the mode of proof of the rest to any one desirous of pursuing the subject further. In the fourth section it is shown that all six forms L, .. A', . are divisible by the Hessian of U, and that X, id are also divisible by u3, 4I Ott by V3 and g, A' by w3, and that the result of these divisions is a single expression of the degree 12n-27. ? 1. Preliminary Transformation. The first two equations of the system (3) are, as is well known, equivalent to the following, viz. MT -a _ -a * ON where 0 is indeterminate. The third equation, viz. 0 2V=0, when written in full, is 0=0 ?~~V+ 0l sV+ []yvabV+X2-aV+p2aVv>2 +2&i6v2 V+VvXaY + 0 Nv). (7) Now n being the degree of U, we may without difficulty establish the following formulae given by CAYLEY (1. C. P. 381): (n1)-2 = Z2+21zy_ 2 (n -1)v2 X2+26xz2 (nI)w2= ay 1yx-Z2 (n 1)vw= .J.x.z. . (8) (n )vwu-tx-r p X+yz* In a paper recently published in the ' Quarterly Journal of Mathematics,' vol. vii. p. 114, I have given a transformation having the same object in view; but its form is partial and in some sense incomplete, and the mode of proof less direct and obvious than that given in the text.

AV-wdH=O, or(1\ oxV ayv MZV AV (16) ? 2. Elimnination of the Constants of the Conic of Five-pointic Contact. Before proceeding to the application of the formulae (16) to the investigation of the sextactic points, it will be convenient to premise that if s, t be any two homogeneous functions of x, yi, z, the nature of the operation a is such that Ast=sAt+tAs+2(2, 3, ?, ff, o, 6)(,s, s, S byt, Dt), . . (17) and also that AV= 3H, Au=p Avq, Aw=r.(18) This being premised, our first object is to establish an equivalent for OEV= 0, divested of the extraneous quantities a, (3, y. Now, since 3(wRzVbzV)=y E V, 4(ubVv TV)=z EYDV and 0E=0, it follows that bEl(V-waVy bYV)=X DV+FX2V, 0 E (w6V _ UB V) E v + ' 02V, 0E(uayV-_v FV)= voV+ zl2V; and consequently not only do vb`V-wbV, wav -U aV, ubV-vaV vanish with ElY, but, when this is the case, El(v6VV-wYV), .. vanish with l2V. The same will obviously be the case if the operation 0 be continued; so that, in general terms, we may, by operating upon vY..V-w'6,V, .. with the symbol l, 0, 1, 2, .. times, form a system of equations equivalent to that formed by operating on V with the same symbol 1, 2, 3, . . times. And if we represent any of the three quantities vV wY, .VI by MT, the equations W= 0, EOW= 0, 2W=0 will be equivalent to the system BXW Ayw Bzw AW u V w H l * . e (19) MR. W. SPOTTISWOODE ON THE SEXTACTIC POINTS OF A PLANE CURVE. 657 analogous to (16). More generally, if '=ffA-wH'a A2=V A-swaHy A3=wA-aH~3, and if A' stands for any of the three symbols A1, A, A,,, then the equations V=O, 0 V= 0 are equivalent to -ab V=-ab V=-bv; UN V 1 -W the equations 'V=0, 03V=0 are equivalent to e U ~~~V Y W Similarly, if A" stands for any one of the symbols A, A, A3 either the same as A' or not, then 04V=0, 'V= 0 are equivalent to -'raaWTv=-b aAIAv= 1b aAIAv, and so on indefinitely, for 2!V= 0, 0 2i+V= 0. If the series should terminate with 0 2iV=0, e. g. El 6V 0, then the last equivalent would be A"'A"A'V=0, where A"' stands, like A", for any one of the symbols Al, 2 indifferently. The form W, however, presents peculiar advantages for the application of the operations A, as will be more fully seen in the sequel. And it follows from what has been said above that, if W retain the same signification as before, we may replace the equations W= 0 O W=O (and consequently the equations O V==O, 02V=O) by 1 1 1vaw= 'aW and in . the same way the equations 2 'W= 0, E 3'W= 0 (and consequently El 3V= 0, 04V=0) by and so on. I do not, however, propose on the present occasion to pursue the general theory further. Returning to the problem of the sextactic points, and forming the equations in W (19), we have lat(1zayv-eawv)=lvay("ayv-vatv)-la#(8a~v-vazv)=s-X a(8a~v) J(20) WIH~~~~~~~~~~~ 658 MRh W.

Also since BV, aYV, ZV are linear in x, y, z, it follows that AV=V 0, A-V=0, A'6Y=0; hence, applying the formule (17), (18), AV'a,fV ga6_v+2(j.. I... )(WS d) t)anaz Iz ay ZV). But since 2W1+ILv1+e=o 0, Iw'+Jv1v+&d=H, @w'+fv +& = 0, it follows that v Similarly, Awa6V=rbYAV+2HlbYV, so that (20) become 311 qazV-raYV = (W`6zV-v`6,V+2vg -2wh)=.. rfbzv-Pa6,v=3(V"6xV ula.V + 2wa -2uy)= i..

Before proceeding further, it will be convenient to notice that the quantities m&X-xP, .. are capable of being transformed in a manner which will be useful hereafter, as follows: P-=Xtx +(ww'-vvp$x+(v'q-w'r)ux Xucx + (ww' -vv')(3n2H qy-rz) (vm q-wr)(vywz) -X(ztux+w'y +v'z) + 3(n-2)Hl(wwt-vv') =(s-l 1)ulX Jr 3(n -2)H(ww'VV'), i. e. _-uX+xP=(n-2){uX-3H(vv' .-ww')} -ztY+1P=(n-2){uY-3H(wu,-ztv' )} i.(26) -ztZ +zP=(n-2){uZ -3H(uv'-vvuj )}. j Returning to (25), and taking any one of the three as W, we shall have for 0 3V=0, 04V=0 o05V=0, aa.,QiX-xP)+h,6(uY-yP)+g3 (uZ-zP)02U =0 a'6(uXIxP)+h6(uY-yP)+ga (zZ-zP)2v =0 1 a6 (uZ-zP)02w=0 aA(uX -xP)+hA;(uYyP)+gA(uZ-zP) -SGH= O; and similar groups may be formed from the other two equations of (25). Now as (27) contain only three out of the six constants a, . . .. , and the single indeterminate 02, they are sufficient for the elimination in view, and give for the equation whereby the sextactic points are to be determined, a (uX-xp) a,(mY-yP) b (uZ-ZP) z& az(ux-xP) az(UY-yP) (uz-zP) W .

And as L, ;,' differ only in respect of a numerical factor, any other factor that can be predicated of L may be affirmed of Z', and vice versd; and similarly for the other pairs ? 3. Formulce of Reduction. The degree of the expressions (28) or (29) is 18n36; it remains to show that existence of certain extraneous factors, which when divided out will reduce the degree to 12n--27, and at the same time render the three forms identical.

Consequently H is a factor of all the expressions El .. *.., which was to be proved. .Although not absolutely necessary to our argument, it is perhaps worth while to show, as may readily be done, that JL is divisible by u.

Similarly, it will be found that the coefficients of (pXAxP+2HX) (pY AyP + 2HaY) (pZ -Az P+2H rZ ) are -(n-2)(3HK+5P2)U, -(n-2)(3HK+5P2)v, -(n-2)(3HK+5P2)w respectively; and consequently the whole expression (n2)(3HK+5P2){(pX AxP + 2HX)u +(pY -yP + 2HMY)v +(pZ -AzP+2H6xZ)w+ 2HP}' =-(n-2)(3HK+5P2){-2HP -2(. .)(u, v, w)(6,P, 6YP, aZP)+M2HP} =-(n-2)(3HK+ 5P2) -2n-1)+ M2 HP.

Similarly, it might be shown that Ml or M' is divisible by v, and N or N' by wv. It follows from what has gone before that L, 4, , L', 1', Q' are all divisible by H, that L, I' are divisible by u, 1, 1J' by v, ^, ^' by w, and consequently dividing MR. W.

From these equations it follows that Bu?+C_ Bv+?C2_B3W + C3. (50) U2 w2. But as u, v, w do not in general vanish simultaneously, these relations can hold good only in virtue of B1 being divisible by u1 and C1 by uo2; B2 by v, and C2 by v2; B3 by w and C3 by w2. Whence, finally, L is divisible by Hu', 4I by Hv3, A by Hw3; and fhie degree of the equation is reduced to (18n36)3(n2)3(n-1) =12n27. Also, since the ratios (Blut+Cl) : U (B2v+C2):v2, (B3w+C3): w2 are in virtue of (50) equal (say =B), it follows that X, 1, R, L', 4it', jr' all lead to the same result, viz. A+B=O, which it was our object to prove. MDCCCLXV. 4 z
