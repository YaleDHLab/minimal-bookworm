XVI. Newton's Binomial Theorem legally demonstrated by Al-. gebra. By the Rev. William Sewell, A. M. Communicated by Sir Joseph Banks, Bart. K. B. P. R. S. Read May 12, 1i796. _~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ LET m and n be any whole positive numbers; and 1 + x a binomial to be expanded into a series, as 1 + Ax + Bx2+ Cx' +, &c. where A, B, C, D, &c. are the coefficients to be determined. Assume vm=F+i\xn = x + Ax + Bxz + Cx' Dx + &c. And zm= T7-1 + Ay + By2 +Cy3 + Dy4 +, &c. Then will v'-= 1 + x, and zI = I+y .*.nznX-y. And vm _ m_ A xx-y + B x ?-y +.C x) -y3 + D x x -y +, &c. DXtE _ 4 _Y+,&C Consequently , = A + B x x + y + C x xz + xy + yt +D x x3+ y + y 3 + &c. Now vm-zm v--z xvm +I Vm-2Zz + V3z +&Cc.z-3 Also vn --z V Z X VnI Vn+ 2 Z + V -3 Z +j, &c... .

The law is manifest; and it is likewise evident that the Mr., SEWELL'S Demonstration, &c. 83 numerator and denominator of the fraction, respectively terminate in m and n terms. Suppose then x =y; then will v z; and our equation will become nV , or mv,, _ A + 2 Bx +3 Cx1+ 4Dx' +, &c. But v" = i + x, therefore by multiplying we have mn =A n +A+2Bx+2B + 3Cx'+3C+4Dx'+,&c. Or vm= m en A nA t.znB 2nB+3nC 2 3nC++nD } m + z + an x + &o~~+ X Compare this with the assumed series, to which it is similar and equal, and it will be nA_ m nA+ 2nB A m WB+3nC B &c. =, &c. n A ;B m nA MC2nl B &c fl I~~.2.n 1.Z.3.fl mln ~m Mxinn ,_~ mXm-nxm-zn Therefore 1 + I = 1 + X + s mxm-nxn.n X3 +, &c. the law is manifest, and agrees with the common form derived from other principles. Sch. In the above investigation, it is obvious that unless m be a positive whole number, the numerator abovementioned. does not terminate: it still remains, therefore, to shew how to derive the series when m is a negative whole number. In this case, the expression (Vm Zr) assumes this form, V or its equal zvnv?n which divided by v' -z7, as before, gives ZnVn-Vzx :Vm"+Vm'~Z+V'7-3Zz, va zm vnI Zn X~f Vn V + Vn m + V-n 2 + ;MDCCXCVI. e '-D 384 Mr. SEWEL L'S Demonstration, &c. n I+ V,4 Ova Z+Vn3 ZI, + &C.

The remainder of the process being the same as before, shews that the series is general, or extends to all cases, regard being had to the signs. Q. F. D.
