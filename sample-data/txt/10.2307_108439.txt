PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS. XV. Discussion of Meteorological Observations taken in India, at various heights, embracing those at Dodabetta on the Neelgherry Mountains, at 8640 feet above the level of the sea. By Lieutenant-Colonel W. H. SYKES, F.R.S. Received January 12,-Read March 21, 1850. IN the year 1835 the Royal Society did me the honour to publish the results of six years' meteorological observations, taken by me on the elevated plateau of the Dukhun (Deccan) from 1825 to 1830, both years inclusive; my chief object being to illustrate the diurnal oscillations of the barometer as indicative of the periodic tides (if they may be so called) of the atmosphere. I showed that in many thousand observations, taken personally, there was not a solitary instance in which the barometer was not higher at 9-10 A.M. than at sunrise; and lower at 4-5 P.m. than at 9-10 A.M., whatever the state of the weather or the indications of the thermometer or hygrometer might be; nor was there a solitary instance in 1830, during which year only I took systematic night observations, and observed at the turning-points every five minutes, in which the maximum nocturnal tide was not higher at 9-10 P.M. than at 4-5 P.m. The 4-5 A.M. minimum tide was less regularly noticed than the other three tides ; but nevertheless sufficiently often to render it perfectly clear, that in the twenty-four hours there were two minima as well as two maxima of pressure in twenty-four hours. I had the advantage at times of carrying on my observations in the six years, at a mean elevation of 1800 feet, simultaneously with observations made in Bombay at the level of the sea, and at Mahabuleshwur at 4500 feet above the sea. These simultaneous observations for limited periods led me to remark, that the amount or range of the diurnal oscillation between the maximum and minimum hours did not correspond at the different elevations. At the level of the sea in Bombaythe range between 9-1 0 A.M. and 4-5 P.M., appeared generally to be less than the range between the same hours in Dukhun (Deccan) at 1800 feet above the sea; but at Mahabuleshwur, at 4500 feet, the range was constantly less than in Bombay or on the plateau of the Deccan. Not having had further means of prosecuting inquiry into the fact, it was with much interest I remarked that the orders of the Court of Directors of the East India Comtpany had been carried out by the astronomer at Madras, and meteorological observations taken for a whole year at a MDCCCL. 2 Q 298 LIEUT.-COLONEL SYKES'S DISCUSSION OF METEOROLOGICAL greater elevation above the sea-level, than had ever been attempted before in India. Observations so made were peculiarly acceptable to me, as they would subject the accuracy of my own observations to an additional test, and would supply the means of investigating the supposed diminished diurnal oscillation of the barometer in relation to elevation above the sea. At the present time I have the further advantage of being enabled to subject my Deccan observations to the test of comparison with recent observations at the Bombay and Madras Observatories, taken chiefly with a view to determine the amount of the hourly and diurnal changes of the barometer. Those for Madras are from the years 1841 to 1845, both inclusive*: for Bombay, I am sorry to say, the records which have reached my hands are for more limited periods. Dr. BUIST, LL.D., while in temporary charge of the observatory, made observations for 1842, 1843 and 1844, but those for 1843 and 1844 only are available to me, and Professor ORLEBAR has published observations from. April to December 1845. In addition to the above, a meteorological register is kept in the office of the Deputy Surveyor-General in Calcutta, the instruments since 1844 being new, and of NEWMAN'S construction; but hourly observations do not appear to have been taken, and three out of the five periods of observation, namely, sunrise, noon and sunset, are useless for determining the diurnal oscillation of the barometer; and the barometrical observations taken before the receipt of the new instruments, which came to hand respectively in 1844 and 1847, were recorded from defective instruments. TrRoUGHToN's barometer reduced to 320 stood at . . . 29'493 Colonel EVEREST'S reduced to 32? stood at .29637 While NEWMAN'S barometer of Sept. 1844 stood at. . . 29'654 And that of April 1847 at . . * . . . . . 29'667 The height of the cistern above the level of the sea being 18X21 feet. Observations are also taken at the Royal Observatory at Oude, and at the Rajah of Travancore's Observatory at Trevandrum; but the records have not reached my hands, nor are those of the magnetic observatory at Simla available to me. Independently of the diurnal atmospheric tides, the Dodabetta observations afford the means of further investigating the debatable question of the influence of elevation upon the quantity of rain precipitated; for these observations contrasted with the records from Mahabuleshwur, Mercara in Coorg, and from the numerous stations in Travancore furnished by General CULLEN (all the localities being under nearly the same meridian, although differing greatly in latitude), will supply data, which, if they do not set the question at rest, will assist to guide the judgement to deductions approximating to the truth. Diurnal Tides.-I shall first notice the observations taken at the greatest elevation. The Dodabetta observations commenced in February 1847. The locality of the observatory, which is in latitude 110 23' 22" N., and longitude approximatively 760.47 E. of Greenwich is understood to be the highest point in the range of Ghauts in Western * At Madras, from the years 1822 to 1837 the barometric records are useless for determining the daily atmospheric tides, the hours of observation being sunrise,-1O A.M., noon,-2 r.Mv., and sunset,-1O P.M. was added -in some of the latter years. Hourly observations only commenced in 18S41. OBSERVATIONS TAKEN IN INDIA. 299 India, that run parallel to the sea-coast from latitude 240-25? to Cape Comorin. This range of mountains rise abruptly above the western coast of India, and the watershed from them is almost entirely to the Coromandel or eastern coast of the Peninsula of India. lThe aqueous vapours from the ocean are condensed on these mountains, and as Dodabetta is within the influence of both the southwest and north-east monsoons, it would appear to be favoured with rain in every month in the year. The observations were taken by an assistant of the Madras Observatory, JOHN DE CRUZ; and as the instruments had been selected by the astronomer, Mr. TAYLOR, and every precaution taken to ensure accuracy in the observations, there is every reason to suppose they are worthy of confidence. rTo determine the pressure of the atmosphere, observations were taken only twice in the day at the supposed hours of maxima and minima; namely, 9h 40m A.m. and 3h 4OMP.M., excepting on the 21st and 22nd of each month, when the observations were taken hourly for twentyfour consecutive hours. With respect to the daily oscillation of the barometer the following Tables are given, and the records show, that, as in my observations in the Deccan, there is not at this great elevation a single day throughout the whole year in which the pressure at 3h 40S P.M. is higher than at 9h 40S A.M., and there is but a solitary instance in which the pressure at the two hours is identical. On the 15th of August the barometer is recorded as standing at 210.952 at 9h 40m A.M., and at 210.952 at 3h 40m P.M.; but as there is not an approximation to anything similar in the preceding or following days, it may be questioned whether this supposed suspension of the atmospheric tide may not be a typographical error, that might well be excused in a multitude of figures. As these observations taken at such a height are the first of the kind recorded in India, I have thought it right to append them in extenso; at least for pressure and temperature, and wet bulb depression*. * While this paper is passing through the press, Lieut. R. STRACHEY of the Bengal Engineers is arrived in England from his travels in the Himalayas and Thibet. He made some hourly observations of the barometer at an elevation of 18,400, at 16,000, and at 11,500 feet, and found that the horary oscillations or atmospheric tides were as regular as on the plains of Hindoostan, and the hours of maxima and minima were the same. Meteorological observations made by Lieut. R. STRACHEY on Lunjar Mountain in Thibet (lat. 310 2' north) at an elevation of 18,400 feet above the sea, August 22nd and 23rd, 1849. Date. Hour.

An inspection of the above Tables shows that the range of the daily pressure, on the whole, had been very regular. The minimum oscillation was 0'08 on the 25th of July, although on the preceding and following days it was respectively 0'059 and 0,069; on the 25th of July 0-18 of rain fell, but the oscillation was only 0'16 on the 10th of June, on which day no rain fell, and the wet bulb was depressed 3'-6 in the morning and 10 in the afternoon. There are two other instances in which the diurnal oscillation was less than three hundredths,-on the 11th of April *022, and on the 3rd of June *026. The maximum oscillation occurred on the 16th of June, and was *144. The preceding dayit was '102,butthe followingday itwas only 040. On the 18th of March it was * 102, on the 1 st of March '094, and on the 19th of February '092; with these few exceptions of maxima and minima in diurnal oscillation, the daily range of the barometer was from '040 to '060, showing no violent atmospheric changes. The maximum pressure was on the 17th of March, and was 22'218 in., and the minimum on the 23rd of June, when the barometer stood at 21-800, although only '09 of an inch of rain fell on that day, and little for several days before. The extreme annual range of the barometer, therefore, was only '418, or less than half an inch. I have shown, in my former paper in the Philosophical Transactions, that the annual range in the Deccan, at 1800 feet above the sea, was only '672 in 1830, from 28'242 in. in January to 27-570 in July, the difference of the thermometer at the extreme periods being only 10.4; and in no instance, on comparing the maximum pressure of one year with the minimum pressure of any other year, did the difference amount to eight-tenths of an inch. In GOLDINGHAM'S tables at Madras, for twentyone years, the greatest range in any year (with the single exception of a terrific storm in May 1820) appears to have been '960 in 1818. In the more careful observations recorded by Capt. LUDLOw at the Madras Magnetic Observatory, from 1841 to 1845 both inclusive, taken hourly, the maximum range in 1842 (the observations for 1841 being imperfect) was from 30'156 at forty-one minutes past 9 A.M. on the 5th of December, to 29'454 on the 1st of June at 3h 41"n P.M., and 29'455 on the 3rd of June at 4h 41m P.M. the range being 0-702 of an inch, the standard thermometer at the maximum pressure being 80 6, and at the minimum 970?3. In 1843 the maximum pressure was 30'208 on the 24th of January at 9h 41n A.M., and the minimum on the 21st of May being 29'256 at 3h 41m A.M., the range therefore 0'952; the thermometer at the maximum 810.2, and at the minimum period 770 8m. In 1844 the maximum pressure was on the 16th of January, i. e. 300'170 at 9h 41m A.M., and the minimum on the 1st of June, at 4h 41m P.M., i. e. 29'S537, the range therefore 0'633, the thermometer at the first period being 790.5, and at the second 89.8. In 1845 the maximum pressure was on the 10th of January, 30?-196 at gh 41m A.M., and the minimum on the 31st of May, 290.531 at P 41"m P.M., the range therefore 0'665: the thermometer at the maximum period was 790.9, and at the minimum it was 1010.5.

The maximum pressure at Dodhbetta, in 1847, was on the 17th of March, instead of December or January, as at Madras, but the minimum occurred in June, as at Madras. The Poona maximum was in January and the minimum in July; at Bombay, in 1843, the maximum pressure occurred on the same day and the same hour as at Madras, and the minimum pressure occurred equally in May, but on the 16th instead of the 21st of May. These facts Dr. BUIST recorded in a series of meteorological observations, taken hourly in Bombay for the year 1843, on the opposite side of the peninsula from Madras; and in his tables it is stated that the maximum pressure of the atmosphere, 30*136, occurred on the 24th of January at 10 A.M., and the minimum pressure, 29-431, on the 16th of May, before the monsoon set in, at 4 P.M.; the extreme range therefore being 0*705, while the extreme range at Madras in that year was 0-952, but the mean of the five years at Madras was 0-735. In Bombay, in 1844, the range was '661 from 301 19 on the 13th of January to 29'458 on the 4th of June. At Calcutta unfortunately the observations were not taken hourly, and exact data are not attainable; but the record in 1846 states that the maximum pressure occurred on the 12th of January at 91' 50m A.M., viz. 30'225, and the minimum on the 25th of July at 4 P.M. 29,356, the annual range therefore 0-869. In 1847 the barometer stood highest on the 5th of February at 9h 5a0mn being 30'169, and the least pressure was on the 25th of May, at sunset, 29,310, the annual range therefore 0-859, singularly approximating to that of the preceding year, but in both years being greater than at Madras or Bombay. Inl 1848, at Calcutta, the maximum pressure was on the 24th of December 30,231 (9th of February 30 200, and 16th of February 30,191), and tile niinimum pressure on the 20th of July 29'270 (on 18th of June 29-353, and on 20th of May 29 459), the extreme range in the year * For 1830. t For ten months of 1828-29. MIDCCCL. 2 R 306 LIEUT.-COLONEL SYKES'S DISCUSSION OF METEOROLOGICAL therefore was 0961. At no one of the places in the Table does there appear to have been a range of an inch; not only within the year, but taking the maximum pressure of one year with the minimum pressure of another year, the range of the barometer never amounted to 1 inch; and but for a record left by the late Mr. GOLDINGHAM, astronomer at Madras, it might be supposed the peninsula of India was not subject to any great changes of pressure. In a furious hurricane however which occurred at Madras on the 30th of October 1836, at 6 A.M., the barometer stood at 29,940. and at 7 P.M. it stood at 28'285, and stood at that during an awful lull until 71 45m P.M., when the hurricane recommenced and the barometer rose to 28,0725; the removal of pressure in thirteen hours amounting to 1-665 inch. But the area of any such removal of pressure would appear to be comparatively limited, and we are indebted to the elaborate researches of Mr. PIDDINGTON of Calcutta, and Colonel REID of the Royal Engineers, in their investigation of the Rotatory Storms or Cyclones within the tropics, for enabling us to give an approximative area to the great depressions of the barometer at sea, of which the observations on shore scarcely record a trace. For instance, in a storm at Madras on the 16th of May 1841, the hourly observations at the observatory gave the barometer 29,650 at 10 A.M., and the lowest depression was 29,513 at 4h 41m P.M., while the barque Tenasserim, which had been compelled to slip her cable and run to sea at 1 P.M., at 8 P.M., when not many miles distant from Madras, had the barometer at 28-60, the mercury at Madras at the same hour standing at 29,641, there being a difference of pressure of more than an inch of mercury within a few miles. The only effects of this storm upon the diurnal tide at Madras were, that the maximumn nocturnal tide turned at 10h 4111 P.M. instead of 9h 41m P.M., and the minimum ebb tide stopped at 2h 41111 A.M. instead of 3b 41m A.M., but the minimum day-tide turned at the usual hour, 3h 41 P.M. Again, in a storm at Madras which took place on the 21st of May 1843, the simultaneous record of the barometer at the observatory and on board the General Kyd, which had been compelled to slip her cables and put to sea from Madras roads, was as follows Hours. hl mjh m h m h m h m h m h m h m h m h m h m 12 41 3 41 5 41 7 41 9 41 11 41 12 41 2 41 A.M. 12 41 2 41 P.M. 5 41 23rd noon.

The daily atmospheric tides continued at Madras despite tile storm. The barometer reached its maximum at 911 41m A.M., 29A421 ; and at 3h 4Em P.m. it had fallen to its minimum, 29 360, then as usual it rose to 29'498 at 91i 41"' P.M., and OBSERVATIONS TAKEN IN INDIA. 307 as usual fell gradually to 29 373 at 3h 41Im A.M. Although therefore the general pressure of the atmosphere had been lowered three or four-tenths of an inch from the 20th and 21st of May, the daily tides had not been interrupted, the maxima and minima occurring at their usual hours. In a storm at Madras on the 24th of October 1842, the P.M. tide reached its maximum at 10o1 41Im P.M., but the ebb stopped at 1h 41m A.M. instead of 3h 41m A.M., and then rose until 91 41m A.M., the duration of the ebb being three hours only, and the flow from 1h 41m A.M. to 9h 41m A.M., no less than eight hours; the next ebb six hours, and the subsequent flow seven hours. One other illustration will show how little the pressure of the atmosphere is affected at a great height by a proximate storm. On the 17th and 18th of April 1847 a great storm occurred on the Malabar coast. The following is the record of the barometer on the 17th, at diffelent distances from the centre of the storm, as recorded by Colonel REID; the Dodabetta observations being interpolated by myself. in.

It is thus shown that the mean daily range for the year is 0'060, and in no month of the year did it. exceed 0-079 in. This is different from Mahabuleshwur, Poona, Madras and Bombay. At Mahabuleshwur, at 4500 feet, the mean diurnal oscillation for ten months, by simultaneous observations, was 0'0694, and in no month did the monthly mean exceed 0'0835. At Poona, at 1823 feet, for 1827, it was 0'1009, for 1828 it was 0 1075, and for 1829 it was 0'0991 ; but this last diminished oscillation is partly to be attributed to three months' observations having been taken at an elevation of 4000 feet above the sea; but in 1830 the barometers were stationed for the whole year at Poona, at 1823 feet, and the mean diurnal fall of the barometer from 9-10 A.M. to 4-5S P.M. was 0'1166; the mean of the four years was 0 1060. The greatest mean diurnal range for any month in those four years was 0'1616 in the month of Deceriber 1827. At Madras hourly observations were recorded from the years 1842 to 1845, both inclusive, and for ten months in 1841, of which I shall not take any account, as the year is incomplete. The mean monthly fall of the barometer from gh 41m A.M. to 3'1 4lm P.M. daily, was respectively 0' 124, 0'120, 0'122 and 0 121, exhibiting a singular uniformity, the differences being only in the thousandths of an inch of pressure. This uniformity is equally marked in the successive months of the several years, and I have gone through the labour of working out the details to show it, the Madras printed ob~servations bosing a record ofE facts only without deductions or commtent.

The mean of the four years, at Madras, in the montlhs of highest pressure, December and January, is 0'1 11, and the mean of the four years in the months of least pressure 0-122. The mean daily oscillation therefore was greatest when the pressure of the atmosphere was least. The same was not observed to be the case in the observations made in the Dukhun in the years 1827, 1828, 1829 and 1830; the means for the two periods being 0'131 and 0,081; nor in Calcutta in the years 1829, 1830 and 1831, the oscillations being respectively 0I118 and 0 1 00; and in 1848 the difference was more marked, the means of the daily oscillation for the periods of greatest and least annual pressure being 0,l135 and 0-106: the same was the case at Bombay and at Dodabetta. This peculiar feature exhibited at Madras is not satisfactorily explained by its not being subjected, like Calcutta and Bombay, to the south-west monsoon, because the general curve of pressure at Madras follows the order of pressure at Calcutta and Bombay, with the exception of the month of November in the years 1844 and 1845, when the mean monthly pressure was greater in that month than in December. The hourly observations at Madras were too systematically and apparently accurately taken to suppose there could have been inaccuracy in the records, and they are quite as trustworthy, if not more so, than any other meteorological records in India. There appears a great discrepancy in the mean daily range at Madras and Bombay in the months from March to November, particularly in the month of April, which does not belong to the monsoon of either place. In the other months, the small range at Bombay may be accounted for by the prevalence of the monsoon at Bombay and the absence of the monsoon at Madras, but the means of the daily range for the year indicate a greater oscillation at Madras than might have been expected.

Similarly, the rising tide from 3h 41m_4h 41Im A.M. to 9h 4lmn Ioh 41M A.M. ill the month of February was '096, '095, 095 and '100 in successive years. The falling night-tide between P.M. and A.mV. does not exhibit quite the same regular features; for instance, in the month of March we have '064, '058, 055 and '071. November also has '063, '0707, 059 and '075; but the annual means of each tide, as in the great diurnal tide, remarkably approximate to each other in successive years, as is shown by the Table, which is worked out from the Madras hourly observations. Another feature exhibited by the Table is the alteration in the range of the monthly means of the diurnal movement of the same tide in different months of the year, the increment and decrement alternating at different seasons of the year with the increment and decrement of another of the tides; for instance, in the month of January throughout the foul' years the rising tide from 3h 4P m -4h 41 P.M. to 9h 41 m10h 41m P.M. iS LESS than the rising tide from 3h 4 1 -4h 41m A.M. to 9h `_ I 0h 4 1m A.M.; but the reverse of this takes place as the year advances, and in April the P.M. rising tide is considerably greater than the A.m. rising tide, and this continues until November', when the previous relations return. The same remarks do not apply to the two falling tides, as the falling tide by day is invariably greater (more than double) than that of the falling tide by night. In mv paper on the Atmospheric Tides of the Deccan, I gave a Table (No. 3) of the anomalies in the period of the ebb and flow of the different tides in 1830, and to enable me to do this I had observed the barometer every five minutes about the period of the expected turn of the tide. The anomalies were numerous. In the Madras hourly observations the same anomalies are observable, as the intervals of maxima and minima vary from five hours to eight hours, although the absolute time of the turn of the tide within the hour is not shown. Dr. BuIsT's observations in Bombay for 1843 and 1844 are also hourly, and exhibit the same occasional irregularities in the time of the tides turning as at Poona and Madras. The recent observations at Calcutta do not afford the means of detecting this no doubt existing fact; for observations at Calcutta are not recorded by night at all, and only every two hours during the dav. A hare inspection of and reliance upon the Calcutta monthly tables therefore would justify the assertion that the daily maxima and minimna in the oscillations of the barometer occurred at fixed hours, which, although generally true, is not absolutely so. The observations at Dodabetta were unfortunately not made hourly, with the exception of those for twenty-four hours between the twenty-first and twentysecond days of each month; the means of comparison therefore of the diurnal hourly Oscillations with those of Madras and Bombay, are limited to those twenty-four hours in each month; but although so limited, features of interest are exhibited. It has hitherto I believe been supposed that the two ascending and two descending diurnal tides of the atmosphere within the tropics, although turning after a longer or shorter interval in each tide, were never interrupted or retrograde in the onward or backward movement of each tide. The Dodabetta hourly observations idicate that such is not the case, and I have thrown the facts into a table for a comprehensive view of them.

It is hence seen that in the month of March the diurnal tide, which usually falls from 10 A.M. until 4 P.M., turned at 3 P.M., and should then have gradually risen until 9--10 P.M., instead of which it rose only until 4 P.M. and then fell until 5 P.M., when it turned again and ran its usual course. In the same month the A.M. tide, which usually falls from 10 P.M. until 4 A.M., had its fall interrupted at 2 A.M. and rose until 3 A.M., when it turned and fell to its ordinary minimum, and then gradually rose until 10 A.M. In the month of May the daily minimum occurred at the proper hour, 4 P.M., and its ordinary regular rise continued until 5 P.M.; but at this hour it changed and fell until 6 P.M., but at that hour resumed its usual course. The other tides were free from these aberrations, but two of them turned at 3 and 9 A.M. instead of 4 and 10 A.M. In the month of June the flow is irregular in the 4 A.M. tide. Its minimum occurs properly at 4 A.M., and it rises until 5 A.M., but at this hour it has turned, instead of continuing to rise, and falls until 6 A.M., when the barometer is as low as at 4 A.M.,-a solitary instance within the year. In the month of January 1848, the falling tide from 10 P.M. goes on regularly until midnight, when it turns and rises until 1 A.M.; it then turns again in the proper direction, but instead of stopping at 4 A.M., the minimum hour, it continues until 5 A.M. and then turns. An inspection of the Table shows that the barometer never appeared to remain stationary at the turning hour of the maximum A.M. (9-10) tide, but that in the months of January, February and April, no movement of the tide took place for a full hour at the 9-10 P.M. maximum tide. In August, although the other tides flowed as usual, that of the A.M. period remained stationary from 2-4 A.M., both inclusive. The maximum A.M. tide occurred six times in six months of the year at 9 A.M., and six times in the other six months at 10 A.M. The maximum nocturnal tide took place only twice at 11 P.M., thrice at 9 P.M., five times at 10 P.M., and thrice was stationary between 9 and 10 P.M. The minimum diurnal tide turned once only at 6 P.M. The chief irregularities appear to have been in the A.M. minimum nocturnal tide, embracing the hours from 1-6 A.M. On looking over the Madras hourly observations for four years for the twenty-four hours between the 21st and 22nd of each month in the year 1842, there are only two instances of similar irregularities. On the 22nd of March in the falling A.M. tide at 2h 41"' A.M., the barometer stood at 29-859, and at 3h 41"m A.M., instead of continuing to fall, it had risen to 29,869, but at 4h 41"m it resumed its regular course and fell to 29'865. On the 22nd of November an irregularity occurred in the nocturnal P.M. tide. At 10" 4J1fl the barometer stood at 30'004; at 11h 41"r it had fallen in due course to 29,991, but at 12h 41m it had risen to 29 992, and only at Ih 41m resumed its usual ebb, and fell to 29,981. In the year 1843 there are also only two instances of irregularity in the spci-fied days; namely, on the 21st of August in the A.M. falling tide. At 1h 41tm A.M. the barometer stood at 29722; at 2" 41r instead of falling, it rose to 29 725, then fell, at 3h 41m, to 29'724; then rose, at 4dh 41"m to 291726, and continued regular to the maximum period at 9 A.M. Oin the 21st of December, at 1 1h 41" OBSERVATIONS TAKEN IN INDIA. 315 P.M., the barometer was 30,121 ; at 12h 41m, instead of continuing to fall, it had risen to 30 125, but then changed; and at 2'1 4 Im it was 30' 104, and fell regularly till 3h 4im A.M., when it was at its minimum, 30'089. On the 21 st of Septemnber, in 1843, the minimum A.M. nocturnal tide occurred at 1h 41m A.M. instead of 3h 41m, at which hour it took place on the morning of the 22nd; the interval, therefore, between the minimum, of this A.M. nocturnal tide and the maximum of the 9 10 morning tide, was seven hours, the maximum occurring at 8h 411', a very rare instance of the continued flow of this A.M. tide, which usually runs its course within four or five hours, and on rare occasions in three hours; the change of pressure, however, was only equal to 0'1 14, from 29'763 to 29,877. In 1844 there is but one instance of irregularity within the prescribed hours. On the 22nd of September, at 12h 41m A.M., the barometer stood at 29 820; at Ih 41m it had fallen, as usual to 29'808, but at 2h 4lm it had risen to 298 19; at 31 41" to 29-833; but at 4h 4lm it had fallen to 29'832, and then continued regular. In 1845 there is also only a solitary instance on the 21st of March. At 7"1 41 m A.M. the barometer stood at 29'933; at 8h 41m it had fallen, instead of rising, to 29'932, but at 9h 41m resumed its usual course. It will be remarked that at Madras there is not a single instance of irregularity in four years in the fall of the great diurnal tide from 9-10 A.M. to 4-5 P.M., and the instances of irregularities in the other tides only serve to prove that the laws are not without exceptions. From the above comparisons it is seen that the irregular movements in the tides were not common to Dodabetta and Madras at simultaneous periods of time, nor at proximate periods of time. The irregularities in the intervals of the different tides are numerous, as are also the instances of stationary periods in which the atmosphere appears to be quiescent fromn one to two hours. It now remains to notice the deviations from the usual laws at Bombay, as recorded by Dr. BuIST in his Bombay hourly observations for 1843 and 1844. On the 21st of January, at 3 A.M., the barometer stood at 29 864, at 4 A.M. at 29,865; but at 5 A.M., instead of continuing to rise, it had fallen to 29,863, and continued to fall until 6 A.M., when it stood at 29'856; at 7 A.M. it resumed its usual course, and continued to rise until the maximum hour. At Madras, on the same day, malting allowance for the difference of longitude, nothing of the kind occurred. At Bombay, on the 21st of March, at 11 P.M., the barometer stood at 29G688; but at midnight, instead of continuing to fall, it had risen to 29'699, and it was only at I A.M. it resumed its ebb. There was nothing of the kind at Madras, where the maximum, 29'86 1, was attained at 10h 41m with the ordinary regularity. On the 22nd of May, at Bombay, there were: irregularities in all the tides, a thing so unusual, and not occurring at all on the 20th or 23rd of May, as to render the table apocryphal, either from error in the record or in the lithography; the A.M. falling tide stops at 2 AM.. then rises to 8 A.M., falls to 9 A.M., and then rises to 10 A.M., its maximum, however, being at 8' A.M. From 4 P.M. the tide as usual rises to 6 P.M., then falls to 8 P.M., and afterwards proceeds to attain its maximum at 11 P.M. Something similar occurs between I and 5 A.M. on the 21st of June, but not on the 22nd. Nothing, of the kind occurs at Madras, either on the 2 s2 316 LIEUT.-COLONEL SYKES'S DISCUSSI ON OF METEOROLOGICAL 20th, 21st, 22nd or 23rd of May. The last irregularity to be noticed at Bombay, within the lim-it hours., was on the 21 st of October. At midinight the barometer stood at 29'803 ; at 1 A.M. it had risen in the usual course to 29'887, but at 2 o'clock it had fallen to 29-881, and only resumed its ordinary rise at 3 A.M. ; as far as the record goes, there does not appear to have been any ir-regularity at Madras*. Similar instances occur within the lim~it hours in 1844,-on 2 1st of January at 3 A.M, 21st of May at 1 A.M., when the tide remained stationary at 3h 41m, and 5 A.M., and at 1 A.M~. On the 22nd of December. In September the maximum horary pressure occurred at 1Ilb 30m A.M., and in other Months several times at 11 A.M. If we extend our comparisons to Aden, on the coast of Arabia, nearly in the latitude of Madras, but 350 6',of longitude to the west of Madras., we find the very same exceptions to normnal. conditions. Dr. BUIST has been kindenough to transmit to ine proof sheets, now going through the press, of part of a meteorological journal kept. at Aden for 1847 and 1848. Hourly observations were taken on certain term-days monthly; instead of taking up the whole of these terin-days, it will suffice to select those of January and June of each year, these being months in which the maximum and minimum pressure of the atmosphere usually occur in India.

The first marked feature is the almost constant tuirning of tile descending P.m. tide and ascending A.M. tide at 3 P.m. and 3 A.M., instead of at 4 or 5 P.m. and A.M.., as on the continent of India,; to this there are only five, *In a diagram of the comparative readings of seven barometers at Bombay, between the 20th and 21st of June 1843, these anomalies appear to have occurred between 2 and 3 P.m., 7 and 8 P.m., 10 and 11 P.m. and OBSERVATIONS TAKEN IN INDIA. 317 exceptions to the former and only one to the latter; but two of the exceptions are remarkable, the tide having turned on the 7th and 28th of January 1848, at 2 P.M. I do not recollect a single case of the kind in the records in India. In the first of these cases the tide flowed from 2 until 9 P.M., seven hours; and in the second it remained stationary from 2 until 3 P.M., and then flowed until 10 P.M.; this portion of the diurnal movement of the atmosphere occupying eight hours instead of six. As a contrast to these lengthened periods, we find that the 3 P.M. ascending tide, on the 25th of January and 20th of June 1847, flowed only from 3 P.M. until 8 P.m., five hours instead of eight. On the 15th of January 1848, the ascending A.M. tide did not attain its maximum until 11 A.M., but this retardation was probably owing to an inversion in the flow at 7 A.M.; the pressure, instead of increasing at this hour, having diminished from 29 572 at 6 A.M. to 29,563, but after this interruption the usual increase took place up to 11 A.M. It will be seen that there are two instances of a stationary state of the barometer on the 28th of Januiary 1848, from 2 to 3 P.M., and on the 21st of June 1848, from 3 to 4 P.M. Meteorologists know that this circumstance, which would excite no attention without the tropics, is of rare occurrence within the tropics. The next great feature in this Table is the absence of any retrograde movement in the P.M. descending and ascending tides; but this is not the case with the other two tides; as at Dodabetta, several interruptions in the flow or ebb are recorded. In the descending nocturnal A.M. tide there are three instances. On the 15th of January 1847, at I A.M.) the tide has risen from midnight instead of continuing to fall. Precisely the same thing occurs on the 7th of January 1848, at the same hours. On the 21st of June the interruption occurs at an earlier hour. The pressure is at its maximum at 9 P.M.; it then diminishes until 10 P.M., but instead of continuing to diminish it increases until 11 P.M., but at midnight has resumed its usual course. In the A.M. ascending tide there is only one instance of inversion; on the 15th of June 1848, the usual rise stops at 6 A.M. and retrogrades until 7 A.M., it then resumes its usual flow and continues until 1i A.M., a very unusual hour for the period of the maximum of the A.M. tide. Had the termn-days of the other months been noticed, nun erous instances of deviations from normal conditions could have been given. It would be desirable to ascertain whether these aberrations have any relation with changes in the electrical tension in the atmosphere. If these anomalies be tested by a comparison with hourly readings of the barometer, at Aden CORRECTED FOR THE TENSION OF VAPOUR*, for four days in each month of the year 1847, not only is their occurrence rendered unquestionable, but new phases in abnormal conditions appear.

'307 29...5I OBSERVATIONS TAKEN IN INDIA. 319 It has been asserted that when the barometer is corrected for moisture its diurnal movements in the tropics are resolvable into a simple ascending and descending curve in the twenty-four hours, nevertheless the first feature of the Table is the existence of two ascending and two descending tides, although the correction for moisture had reduced the air in which the mercurial column had moved to a supposed dry state. The usual hours of the ebb and flow are generally sufficiently manifest, particularly in the hours of greatest pressure, yet there is the unusual circumstance of the ascending A.M. tide turning in five months at 6 A.M. instead of 9-10 A.M., and in this tide also there are three instances of a check to its usual movements. The ascending P.m. tide has also its anomalies. In eight months it attained its maximum at the usual time between 9 and 10 P.m., but in July there is the rare circumstance of its turning at 5 P.M. instead of 9-10 P.M., and in June and August the equally rare circumstance of its turning at 7 P.M.; the next anomaly in this tide is in October, when it did not turn until midnight. Thechiefanomnalies, as at Madras,Bombayand Dodabetta, occur in the A.M. and P.M., ebb or descending tide. The Table shows that the turning-points of the P.M. diurnal ebb, ranged from noon in February, and July, to 4 P.M. in April and June. In February, when the minitnum occurred at noon, the maximum took place at the usual hour, 10 P.M.; there was therefore the almost unprecedented circumstance of a tide continuing tojfowfor nine hours. In the A.M. descending or ebb tide, the anomalies are even more marked than in the corresponding P.m. tide, for the turnfing-points range from 1 A.M. to 5 A.M. In January it turned at I A.M., and then the ascending tide continued to flow uninterruptedly until 1OA.M., a second instance of a nine hours' flow. In July, September and November, it, also turned at I A.M., but the maximurn occurred at 6 A.M. instead of 1O A.M., the flow in each, of these months being five hours ! a glance of the eye over the Table will show; although the different tides ultimately attained their respective maxima and mininma, yet in many instances they were subject to checks or interruptions, which appeared to give way after a short resistance to the periodic movements of the atmosphere. In the month of August, however, the atmosphere appeared in so vacillating and disturbed a state, that the only tide which turned at the normal hour was the 10 ALM. maximum tide. The means of the hourly readings on four days in each month, corrected for moisture, give a mean curve of pressure in each month which nearly corresponds with the curve of pressure of the daily readings of the barometer co-rrected for temperature only. The maximum pressure with both corrections occurs in December, but the minimum occurs in June corrected for temperature and in Jully with both corrections. The whole of the facts connected with the meteorology of Aden of which I have made use, are from observations taken by Sergeant MoYEs, with excellent instruments, and Dr. BuIST is now passing the observations through the press. These facts, which could be very greatly multiplied, have been somewhat dwelt upon, with a view to a right understanding of HUMBOLDT'S observations in his Cosmos*,* BOHN's Edition, vol. i. p. 320. 320 LIEUT.-COLONEL SYKES'S DISCUSSION OF METEOROLOGICAL where, speaking of the horary oscillations of the barometer, he says, " their regularity is so great, that in the day-time especially, the hour may be ascertained from the height of the mercurial column without error, on the average of fifteen or seventeen minutes. In the torrid zones of the new continent, on the coasts, as well as at elevations of nearly 13,000 feet above the level of the sea, where the mean temperature falls to 44?o6, I have found the regularity of the ebb and flow of the aeirial ocean undisturbed by storms, hurricanes, rain and earthquakes." It is now shown that the horary oscillations have a different range in different months of the year; their range is influenced by height above the sea, and the tides do not always flow and ebb in equal periods of time; but the existence of two ascending and two descending but unequal tides within twenty-four hours within the tropics, is established beyond all question; and if not altogether undisturbed, as HUMBOLDT says, by storms, hurricanes or rain, yet the meteorological records in India prove that the periodic daily movements of the aeirial ocean are never suppressed*. Pressure of the Atmosphere. With respect to the mean pressure of the atmosphere in India near the sea-level, I shall limit, myself to the insertion of a comparative table showing the means of four years' hourly observations at Madras, the means of two years' hourly observations at Bombay, and the observations taken every two hours (but during the day only) at Calcutta, for 1843-44 and 1848. I append however curves of pressure at these places projected for longer periods, and for which I am indebted to Dr. BUIST, LL.D. The barometers at these respective localities, being each only a few feet above the sealevel, should have differed from each other in their mean annual results only in the third place of decimals, or at most only slightly in the second place of decimals, nevertheless the pressure at Bombay differs from that at Madras a twentieth of an inch; and at Calcutta, where the barometer is 17 feet nearer the mean sea-level than at Bombay, the mean annual pressure is even less than at Bombay, while on the other hand the pressure at Aden reduced to the sea-level is greater than anywhere else. These discrepancies originate probably in the neglect of using previously compared instruments. At Madras, the annual mneans in successive years differ. from each other only in hundredths of an inch. For the mean pressure at different elevations tables are annexed. * The observations of Lieut. R. STRACHEY in Thibet, at 18,400 feet above the sea, show that on the 22nd and 23rd of August 1849, the following were the oscillations of the four tides: B. uncorrected B. corrected for temperature. for temperature. 5 P.M. to 11 P.M. ?-059 +I075 1 1 P.M. to 4 A.M. -,033 -*029 4 A.M. to 10 A.M. + 043 + 016 10 A.M. to 3 P.M. 037 -*032 OBSERVATIONS TAKEN IN INDIA. 321 Monthly Mean Pressure of the Atmosphere, reduced to 32?.

An inspection of the above Table shows that the maximum mean monthly pressure does not occur in the same month in successive years. At Madras, in 1842 and 1843, the maximum pressure was in the month of December, in the two following years it was in the month of January. At Bombay, in 1843, the iuiaximum was in December, in 1844 in January, at Calcutta, in 1843, in December, and in 1848 it was in December. At Madras the ruinimun monthly mean pressure, in three years out of the four, occurred in the month of June. In 1843 it was in the month of May, but at Bombay in the same year in June: at Bomnbay and Calcutta in 1844, and in 1848, at Calcutta, it took place also in June. At Poona, at 1823 feet, the maximum was in January and the minimum in July. At Dodabetta, at 8640 feet, unlike any of the stations at the sea-level, the maximum mean monthly pressure took place in March: the same thing occurred at Mahabuleshwur? in 1828-29, at 4.500 feet above the sea; but like the other stations the minimum pressure at Dodabetta occurred in June, but at Mahabuleshwur in July. Dr. BUIST of Bombay mentions that for three years at Aden (1846-48) the minimum occurred in July, and the maximum in February, but by the preceding Table the maximum in 1847 and 1848 occurred in December, and the minimum in both years in July. At Greenwich the mneans of thirty years' observations, recorded in BELVILLE'S Manual, give results inverse to those in India, as the maximum pressure is in June and the minimum in November; but there is a second maximum in January and a second minimum in March; but the greatest daily mean pressure occurs about the 9th of January, and * Thirteen days' observations wanting. t For 1828, remaining months for 1829. t For 1848, remaining months for 1847. ? The means of one year's pressure at Mahabulesliwur is inserted from the lBombay Medical Journal, but the observations do not appear to have been corrected for temperature, and as the maximum pressure is represented to occur in October and the minimum in September, there evidently must be some mistake, and I[ therefore only notice my own simultaneous observations With Dr. WALKER for 1828-29. MDCCCL. 2 T 3t22 LIEUT.-COLONEL SYKES'S DISCUSSION OF METEOROLOGICAL the minimum daily mean depression at the end of November. From the means of eight years' observations, obligingly furnished to me by Mr. GLAISHER, from the Royal Observatory, Greenwich, the maximum was in October; with a second maximum in December, the minimum was in April; corrected however for the tension of vapour, the maximum was in December and the minimum in August; but consecutive years differ greatly when the vapour correction is applied. I attempt no explanation of these anomalies, as much more lengthened observations are required than those at my disposal afford for philosophical deductions. From the month of the maximum pressure, there is a gradual mean monthly decline of pressure until the minimum pressure; then there is a gradual monthly increase of pressure, even when the monsoon sets in at Madras in October until the maximum is attained again; but there is no rule without an exception, and the curve was interrupted in the month of December in the years 1844 and 1845 at Madras, and in 1844 at Bombay; but in Calcutta, in October 1844, and at Mahabuleshwur, and at Dodabetta in December 1828 and 1847 respectively. At Aden, in 1847, it was interrupted in February. In 1848 the curve was regular. Appended to this paper are annual pressure curves at Madras, Bombay and Calcutta, protracted from the records of the barometer at the several places. Tile three localities are under very different conditions of temperature and moisture in the same months, and they differ considerably in latitude and longitude Madras and Bombay, situated upon opposite sides of the peninsula of India, are subject to different monsoons; Madras to the N.E. monsoon, which commences in October and ends in February, and Bombay is subject to the S.W. monsoon, which commences in June and ends in October. Calcutta is under the full influence of the S.W. monsoon, but has occasional showers from the Madras rains. When Bombay is deluged with rain Madras is comparatively dry, and the hot weather prevails; and when Madras is under the influence of the Coromandel rains, Bombay is cold and dry. Very different atmospheric conditions therefore exist at the two places in the same months. Nevertheless the annual curves of pressure protracted from monthly means, may be said to be identical, not only for Madras and Bombay, but also for Calcutta. The few exceptional cases are lost or disappear in the means, and may originate in local causes. It would thus appear that the periodic movements of the mass of the atmosphere within the northern tropic are independent of, or only very slightly affected by, the hygrometric and thermometric conditions of the lower strata of the atmosphere. It occurs to me that this phenomenon may be owing to the sun's place in the ecliptic. When the sun is at the southern tropic, the air above the northern tropic is comnparatively cold and therefore dense, and at its greatest pressure; this would be from December to January inclusive. As the sun returns to the north the air gets gradually warmer and dilates, and the pressure being inversely as the volume, the barometer gradually sinks, until the sun is returning from the northern tropic again, when the inass of the atmosphere gradually cools, gets denser, and the pressure gradually increases again. Supposinig this explanation to have any foundation in tr uth, the curve of pressure within the tr opic south of the equator would be the reverse of that in the tropic north of the equator. The maximum pressure would be from June to July inclusive, OBSERVATIONS TAKEN IN INDIA. 323 and the minimum pressure from December to January inclusive. On referring to the St. Helena observations for 1843 this is very nearly the case, the maximum pressure and minimum temperature being in August instead of July, and the minimum pressure and maximum temperature in February to March instead of January.

In the fitful movements of the atmosphere beyond the northern tropic the sun's influence would not appear to be similarly felt, as the maximum pressure at Greenwich is in October, with a second maximum in December, and the minimum pressure, instead of being when the sun is at the northern tropic, is in November. Temperature. The hourly observations at Madras for four years afford the most complete and trustworthy data for determining at that place the fluctuations of temperature, the exact diurnal and annual range, and the exact periods of the fluctuations in the occurrence of the maxima and minima, which cannot be satisfactorily shown by any observations short of hourly record. For Bombay I have only such records made by Dr. BuIST for the years 1843 and 1844. Those at Calcutta were two-hourly only during the daytime, and those at Dodabetta were made but twice a day, with the exception of twenty-four hours once a month between the 21st and 22nd, when the observations were taken hourly. For exact determinations I am constrained to abandon many proposed comparisons, and in many instances to use less frequently recorded observations to express general features. The following Table shows the monthly means and annual temperatures at Madras and Bombay from hourly observations. For the other localities the means are derived from less frequent observations, and are therefore only approximations to the truth. * The above table is confirmed by the Mauritius and Cape observations; the minimum pressure being from January to Febrularyv inclusive, and the maximum July to September inclusive. 3 T2 Monthly Mean Temperatures at Madras and Bombay from Houtrly Observations, and at Calcutta and elsewher fromt less frequent periods of record.

The mean temperature at Mahabuleshwur, from 1829 to 1843, was deduced from the mean of a daily maximum and minimum thermometer in the shade. OBSERVATIONS TAKEN IN INDIA. 325 The first feature is the close approximation of the annual means at Madras for the four years; the difference between the greatest and least being only 10.26 FAHR., although the difference between the means of the same month in successive years mnay have exceeded three degrees. Nevertheless the means of most of the months in successive years show a great amount of uniformity. The coldest months are December or January, and the hottest May or June. In 1842 and 1843 December was the coldest month. In 1844 and 1845 January was the coldest. In 1842 and 1845 May was the hottest month. In 1843 the maximum mean' heat was not reached until July, and in 1844 it occurred in June. Although these discrepancies occur, the monthly increment or decrement to or from the maximum period is gradual, and rat ely checked or inverted. In Bombay the annual mean temperature for 1843 is almost identical with that of Madras for 1843, although the two places differ 50 41' in latitude. The monthly means of the two places correspond tolerably well from January until July; for instance, February corresponds within a tenth of a degree, and June within two-tenths. But in July there is a difference of 30.79, August 30,31 , September 30.16, Madras being plus: then the sign changes and Bombay becomes plus for the remaining months of the year, and also in January. The coldest month in Bombay was January, and the hottest May. In Bombay, in 1843 and 1844, unlike Madras, there is an inversion in the decrement of heat on the sun's going south; for October is represented as hotter than September in both years: a very remarkable fact is exhibited by these hourly means, namely, that neither the south-west monsoon at Bombay, nor the north-east monsoon at Madras, at all afftct the monthly mean regular increment or decrement of heat, with the exception of October in Bombay. It will be observed that the maximum heat, both at Madras and Bombay, was not when the sun was vertical at either place passing to the northern tropic; but when the sun was near to the northern tropic in June, the mean temperature in 1843 at Madras, in lat. 130 4', was at its maximum in July, while at Bombay, in lat. 18? 55', the greatest heat was in May of that year; and though the sun passes over both places again to the south the mean temperature gradually declines in each year, with the exceptions noticed. I was desirous of inserting in the Table of Mean Temperatures those for 1843 and 1844 at Calcutta, for comparison with the Madras and Bombay observations for the same year; but on referring to the volumes of the Bengal Asiatic Researches for 1843 and 1844, I found that the tables had not been inserted. They were met with however in the Journal of the Horticultural Society of Calcutta, but proved to be records of the temperature during the day only at 92 A.M., noon, 4 P.M. and sunset*. A mean temperature from such data would neces* In the fifth volume of the Calcutta Journal of Natural History, Dr. M'CLELLAND states that the mean temperature of 1844, from daily observations, was 82? 35, the coldest period at sunrise, and the hottest at 2h 40m P.m. daily; the maximum heat 104? on the 10th of April, the miniimum 51` 7 on the 19th of January. and the annual range 520 3. He speaks also of the minimum daily pressure of the barometer occurring twice at 6 P.M. in January, February and May. 326 LIEUT.-COLONEL SYKES'S DISCUSSION OF METEOROLOGICAL sarily be unsatisfactory. In 1847 meteorological tables appear in the Journal of the Asiatic Society of Bengal from the same source as those used by the Horticultural Society in the preceding years, namely, from the office of the Deputy SurveyorGeneral in Calcutta, but they were even of less use than the preceding tables, for they had but two daily records, namely, at 91 A.M. and 4 P.m., and the records were otherwise useless for determining the absolute range of the thermometer, as there was only a record of the maximum temperature and no minimum. In 1848 more elaborate tables make their appearance, containing two-hourly records from sunrise to sunset, at sunrise, 92 A.M., noon, 2h 40m P.M., 4 P.M., and sunset, together with the indications of a maximum and minimum thermometer, but without any observations after sunset. This is an improvement upon the former records, but falls short of the requisites for scientific purposes. The maximum and minimum thermometer certainly gives the range of temperature, but does not give the hours of the occurrence of the maxima and minima. Mean temperatures deduced from a maximum and minimum thermometer may possibly be true; but an arithmetical mean from two extreme observations daily would be incorrect, unless the increment and decrement of heat from a mean point were regular, which is known to be rarely the case. Annual mean temperatures deduced from formulae, of which the latitude is the element, are often fallacious; for independently of the great discrepancies in mean temperatures between America and Europe on the same parallels of latitude, and as indicated also by isothermal lines in Europe, there are places differing little in longitude where the annual mean temperature is higher than at places nearer to the equator, both within and without the tropics: taking an instance from DovE's temperature tables, we have the following: 0 ~~~~~~~~~~~0 1 Aberdeen . Latitude 57 9 Mean temperature 49^18 2 Dundee . .

Latitude 51 30 Mean temperature 5083, or 49'7 by GLAISHER. Aberdeen, therefore, nearly six degrees north of London, has almost the same mean temperature as London: and Edinburgh, intermediate between both, has a lower mean temperature than either, Dundee, five degrees north of London, has absolutely a higher mean temperature; and Liverpool, two degrees north of London, has the same mean temperature. In the tropics similar instances are found. 0 1 i Calcutta . . . . . Latitude 22 34 40 Mean temperature 83-72 Bombay . . . . . Latitude 18 55 42 Mean temperature 81P Madras . .

This mean temperature at Madras and Bombay is deduced from hourly observations ; and had DovE's previously noticed mean temperature been derived from similar records, the anomalies might have been modified or have disappeared altogether. With the reservations contingent upon the explanations given, I shall comprise my observations upon the tem perature tables of places other than those for Madras and Bombay, within very narrow limits. And first, with respect to Calcutta, the means are derived from observations taken at the Surveyor-General's office, with excellent instruments, but the observations are day observations, and it is only for the last six months of 1848 that records were made every two hours. The means, however, of those six months correspond sufficiently near with those of the same six months in the three preceding years to show that the conversion of three-hourly observations into two-hourly observations, had very little effect upon the mean results. What was wanting were observations at night, and of these there are not any. The mean tem.perature of the years, from 1845 to 1848, both inclusive, never falls below 83? 26 (in 1847), and was as high as 84? 1 1 in 1845, and the mean temperature of the four years is 830.72. The coldest month was December, excepting in 1S48, when January was the coldest. The hottest month was May, excepting in 1846, when April was the hottest; the mean temperature of April and May, for the four years, being respectively 87`e12 and 90 27. For the years 1846 and 1847 the mean monthly increment to the maximum heat, and mean monthly decrement to the minimum heat, is gradual and regular, but in 1845 and 1847 there are instances of inversion; in 1845 March is hotter than April; September is hotter than August; in 1848 September is also hotter than August, instead of being cooler. This very high mean temperature of Calcutta is not of ready explanation, even after making an allowance for the want of night observations: situated on a broad river, in the midst of cultivated, wellwooded and moist plains, and within the influence of the sea; on the verge of the northern tropic, it might have been supposed that its position, in respect to latitude, would have affected its mean temperature. The sun is vertical at Calcutta in the first week in June and July, but Calcutta attains its maximum heat in May, while the sun is yet approaching, and the mean temperature is actually diminishing, while the sun is passing and repassing from the tropic, and while the heat ought to be accumulating from the lengthened days, as is shown in the following tabular statement:Latitude N. Longitude E. Sun vertical. Longest day.

It will be remarked also, that the return of the sun over Bombay in July does not prevent a reduction of three degrees in mean temperature; this however might be attributed to the rains commencing; but in its passage over Madras in August the continued mean monthly fall of the thermometer is not interrupted, although it will be recollected there is not any monsoon at Madras in August to correct the effect of the sun's passage. The slanting rays of the sun, within certain angles of incidence without the tropics, produce a heat of great intensity, even where the physical characters of the country do not lead us to expect such. a result; for instance, on the banks of the broad Indus in Scinde the thermometer is known to rise in the shade to 11 00-120? FAHR. Recently, at Peshawur, the following is the record of the thermometer in a house from the 7th to the 14th of May 1849:Sunrise. 8 A.M. Noon. 4 P.M. 9 P.M. Latitude N.

Winds generally westerly, and south-west. Severe dust-storms occasionally. OBSERVATIONS TAKEN IN INDIA. 329 On the 22nd of May 1849, at Ferozepore, lat. 300 53', on the Sutlege river, the thermometer stood at 104? in a good house, the usual precautions being taken against the hot winds. Even in August, at Peshawar, with thunder-storms and heavy rain on the 7th, 9th, 15th, 16th, 17th, 20th and 29th, and with several light showers besides, the maximum was 1040 at 4 P.M., the minimum at sunrise 81?, the midday maximum 101?, and with a midnight maximum. of 1000, and yet the Report says, "The month had not however been characterized, as would be supposed by the indications of the thermometer, by any unusual degree of heat over those which had just preceded it. It even did not range so high as in May, June and July*." Even at Alten, in Finmark in Norway, in latitude 69? 58', where the mean annual temperature is between 350 and 36? FAHR., and where in 1846 the thermometer sunk to 140.8 below zero; on the 27th of July 1847, at noon, the thermometer in the shade rose to 840'7 FAHR. Capt. SCORESBY, in his Arctic Voyages, somewhere mentions, I think, that the rays of the sun were sufficiently powerful to melt the pitch on the sunny side of his vessel, while the air was at a freezing temperature on the shady side. But these intense heats of summer are compensated for by a depression of temperature when the sun is at the southern tropic and the mean annual temperature is not raised. The high mean temperature of Calcutta, therefore, would seem to be influenced by local causes, independently of the vertical or oblique action of the sun, or the length of time the sun is above the horizon. But the anomalies of mean termiperature are not limited to Calcutta. Aden, situated in latitude 120 46' 26" N., longitude 450 15' E., on the shores of Arabia,-shores dreaded for their supposed intolerable heat, has a mean temperature (800.2) lower than that of Bombay, Madras or Calcutta, with a less range of the thermometer, with a maximum heat only of 89? in May and October, and a minimum of 68? 5 in January! and most singularly the mean temperature for every month in 1848 is lower than the temperature of the corresponding month at Calcutta, and, with the exception of November, December and January, lower than at Madras or Bombay. From the maximum mean monthly heat in April 1830, at Calcutta, the temperature gradually declined until the mean monthly minimum in December, excepting in September and October, when the curve was interrupted by a rise of i?-5 in the former month, and of 2? 3 in the latter; after December the temperature gradually rose to its mean maximum. * Dr. WALLIN of Helsingfors, the traveller in Arabia, has furnished me with a copy of his register of the thermometer, from which I learn that at Bagdad, lat. 330 20' N., long. 440 24' E., the thermometer in the shade of a house on the second story, with a N.W. aspect upon the banks of the Tigris, on the 19th of July 1848, at 2 P.M. stood at 1220.9 FAHR., wind W.N.W., on the 13th and 18th at 1200.2, and on seven other days in the month of July at 118? 4; and the lowest heat in the month at 2 P.M. was 101`3 on the 2nd of July, wind N.W., clear. MDCCCL. 2 U 330 LIEUT.-COLONEL SYKES'S DISCUSSION OF METEOROLOGICAL Curves of Temperature at High Levels. Proceeding from the sea-level to considerable altitudes, we find that the mean temperature at Poona, in 1830, at 1823 feet above the sea-level, was 800.28, differing only six-tenths from the mean temperature of Bombay for 1844, and less than one degree of FAHR. from the mean temperature of 1843 at Bombay. A difference of level of 1823 feet therefore gave a difference of less than one degree of temperature. The comparison of the temperatures of the three stations of Mahabuleshwur, Mercara in Coorg, and Uttray Mullay in Travancore, all at the height of 4500 feet above the sea-level, and differing little in longitude, but several degrees in latitude, affords some interesting facts. The latitude of Uttray Mallay is about 8?000 N., long. 760 00' LE, Mercara, lat. 120 30', long. 730 30', Mahabuleshwur, lat. 170 58', long. 730 29'. The mean temperature of Uttray Mullay, situated nearest to the equator, is lower by 30.35 than the mean temperature of Mercara, and 20.66 lower than that of MNahabuleshwur, while the mean temperatures of Mercara and Mahabuleshwur are almost identical. The maximum heat of Mahabuleshwur, in both years recorded, is in April, while the mean of three years at Mercara fixes it in March. At Uttray Mullay the maximum heat, in 1845, was in April, while in 1846 it was in March. At 4140 feet above these levels, namely, at Dodabetta, the maximum heat was, in May, as in Bombay and Calcutta. The minimum heat, at the height of 4500 feet, was in December, at Mahabuleshwur and Mercara in all the years. At Uttray Mullay, in 1845, the minimum mean monthly heat was in June, the only instance of the kind in all the observations discussed in this paper; and in this same year January and October had the same mean temperature. In the next year the minimum heat was in January. At Dodabetta, at 8640 feet, in 1847, the minimum temperature was in December, but, with the exceptions of April and May, the rmean monthly range was so small that most of the months were nearly the same in their mean heat. Mahabuleshwur and Mercara being within the S.W. monsoon, while Uttray Mullay and Dodabetta are subject to both S.W. and N.E. monsoons, the annual curves of temperature might be expected to vary considerably. At Mahabuleshwur and Mercara there is a gradual decrement of heat from the maximum point until the month of October, when the mean monthly temperature rises at both places, but falls after that month to the minimuum of the year. The same thing occurs in Bombay and Poona, but there is no rise in October at Madras nor at Calcutta in 1846 or 1847; and in 1845 and 1848, when the gradual decrement of heat was interrupted, it occurred in September instead of October, as at the other places within the influence of the same monsoon. At Uttrav Mullay and Dodabetta, within tihe influence of both monsoons, we find the annual curve of temperature interrupted in the first place in March, then in July, October and November in 1845, and in July, August and September in 1846. At Dodabetta the increase is quite gradual from December to May; but the natural decrement is interrupted in July, and the temperature rises in August, sinks in Septemiber, rises in October, and then falls to the minimum of the year. From these facts, it appears that the two monsoons derange the OBSERVATIONS TAKEN IN INDIA. 331 curves of temperature at the different places, which might be expected otherwise to coincide with the sun's path in the ecliptic; but further observations from the hill stations may modify these conclusions. Range of Temperature and Hours of Maxima and Minima. Unless where hourly observations are taken, the exact periods of the occurrence of the maxima and minima cannot be determined; and though a self-registering thermnometer will determine the range of temperature, yet the hours of the turning-points cannot be learnt from it. For the hours of the occurrence of the maxima and minima, therefore, I am limited to the hourly observations taken at Madras and Bombay; but for the range of temperature, without reference to specific times, I can avail myself of a maximum thermometer registered at Aden for 1848, and one at Calcutta registered since June 1848. Madras.-Hours of Maximum and Minimum Temperature. The usual impression in India is, that the maximum heat occurs about 2 P.M., and the minimum a little after sunrise. The Madras hourly observations for four years, from which the following Table is prepared, exhibit great anomalies in the hours of the occurrence of the maxima and mninima. In the forty-eight months of monthly range there are seventeen records of the greatest heat occurring about noon (between 11h 41m and 12h 41m); eighteen records between 1 and 2 P.M., and thirteen records between 2 and 3 P.M. In 1842 the maximum daily heat occurred only once about noon (122h 41m) on the 20th of April (960.5). In 1843 it occurred at the same hour, or before it, in January, February, March, May and November. In 1844, at the same hour, in January, April, November and December. In 1845, in March, April, May, September, October, November and December; so that in fact the maximum daily heat, although it took place only at noon in the month of April in 1842, in the other three years, either in one year or the other, occurred at noon in all the months. There is not a single instance of the maximum daily heat occurring after 2h 41m p.m. The minimum heat of the month, in 1842, occurred in May at 211 41m A.M. (810.1), the only record of the kind in -the year. In 1843 there is no similar record, but in 1844 there are two instances of the least heat taking place in July and August at 41m past midnight, and one instance at 2h 41"' A.M. in September. In 1845 there is a solitary case of the lowest temperature at 211 41m A.MV. In the whole four years there are only three instances of the minimum heat being at 3h 41m A.M., two at 4h 41m A.M., twenty-five at 5h 41m A.M., and twelve at 6h 411" A.M.; and one singular instance of the greatest cold in the month being as late as 7" 41"' A.,.,,on the 14th of May 1844. It may be affirmed, therefore, that the greatest cold occurs at Madras most often at 5h1 41"' A.M, The monthly range of the thermometer does not differ very much in the different months of the year, nor does the range ofi the 2 u2 332 LIEUT.-COLONEL SYKES S DISCUSSION OF METEOROLOGICAL thermometer in the same months in successive years exhibit very marked discrepancies, although there are some differences; for instance, in February 1842 the range was 2008, and in February 1845 only 14?@2. In April 1842 the range was 22? 0, and in April 1843 only 140.8. It might have been expected that the greatest range, as at Bombay and Calcutta, would have occurred in the coldest months, and that the greatest discrepancies would have occurred in the comparisons of the same months in succeeding years, but such was not the case. The greatest monthly range in any month at Madras, twice occurred in the month of May in 1844 and 1845, namely, 250.9 and 250.6 respectively. The least range, 120.5, took place in January 1843. The annual ranges varied only from 270?0 in 1843 to 370.j in 1844*. For Bombay I have only hourly readings of the thermometer for 1843 and 1844. The maximum heat twice occurred at noon, on the 11th of August and 6th of December; twice at 1 P.M., on 31st of March and 29th of April; five times at 2 P.M., and three tines at 5 P.M. There is not any conformity in the times or dates of these maxima with those of the samre year at Madras. A remarkable feature in the minitnum daily heat at Bombay is the comparatively late period of the morning at which it took place. On the 4th of January the minimum heat was at 8 A.M., in five other months it occurred at 7 A.M., in two months at 6 A. m., and once only at 5 A.M.; and entirely unlike the numerous instances at Madras, there is not a single case of the minimum heat falling before 5 A.M. in 1843. The greatest range of the thermometer was in the cold months and least in the monsoon; the maximum, 190.3, was in January, and the minimuml, 8? 4, in August. The annual range for 1843 was 240?4. In 1844 the chief feature is, that the minimum heat in the month occurred at midnight on the 2Sth of August, and the minimum temperature occurred at 1 and 2 A.M. on the 22nd of July, as well as at 5 A.M.; twice only the least heat occurred as late as 7 A.M.; the imaximumn heat never occurred after 3 or before 1 P.M. The maximum heat was 910.9 and the m-linimum 6407, the annual range therefore 27?-2. The greatest monthly range was in February, 200.7, and the least in August, 8?.5. The monthly ranges of the two years had a close correspondence. The maximum heat observed in the sun in Bombay was 1420.6 at 1 P.M., 10th of November 1846. Calcutta Range of Temperature. Hourly observations not having been taken at Calcutta, and the records of a maximumn and minimum thermometer having only appeared in the Asiatic Journal since June 1848, I can only give the range of temperature since that date; but I know nothing of the days or hours of record, excepting what is derived from a foot-note at page 550 of the Number of the Journal for June 1848. As at Bombay, the greatest monthly range was in the cold months and least in the monsoon months. Two * A memorandum just received gives the mean temperature of Madras for 1848 at 83' 15; the maximum on the 20th of June 106?, at 3h 41m P.., and the minimum 63`5 on January 26th, at 6h 41m A.M.; the annual range therefore was 42? 5.

OBSERVATIONS TAKEN IN INDIA. 333 maxima ranges of 21-5 and 210 occur in March and January, and the minlinum, 9.4, was in August. The annual range was nearly double that of Bombay, namely, 410.9. The foot-note above alluded to has the following records: 0 1846. Maximum heat in May. . 105 1846. Minimum heat in January . . . 55 0 1847. Maximum heat in May . 1096 1847, Minimum heat in February . . . 50t0 The range in these two years, therefore, being respectively 500 and 590 6 FAHR; the thermometer rising higher and sinking lower than either at Madras, Bombay or Aden near the sea-level. Range of Temperature at Aden. Extending the comparison of thermometric range near the sea-level to Aden, in the latitude of Madras, but 350.6 to the westward of Madras, it will be seen that, unlike Bombay or Calcutta, the greatest range is not in the cold months, nor in the months in which the maximum heat occurs, but in those months in which the mean temperature is comparatively moderate, viz. March, April and October; the smallest range however occurring, as at Calcutta and Bombay, in what are called the, monsoon months at those places, namely, May, June, July, August and September, while in those months at Madras the greatest range of the thermometer takes place. The greatest monthly range at Aden, 110.2, occurs in October, and the least monthly range, 60.0, is almost identical in the consecutive months of June, July, August and September. The annual range is 200?5. If the records of 1848 exhibit normal con ditions, then the climate of the dreaded Aden is more equable than that of places on the sea-level on the coasts of India. The annexed Table contains the elements of the preceding notices Range of Temperature at High Levels. With respect to the majority of the stations at different elevations above the sea, as hourly observations were not kept, anda maximum and minimum therinometer only used, at Mahabuleshwur and Dodabetta the hours of the occurrence of maxima and minima cannot be stated. 334 LIEUT.-COLONEL SYKES'S DISCUSSION OF METEOROLOGICAL Sattarah.-Range of Thermometer.

The ranges represent the greatest and least in any particular day or month. The maximum temperature, at 2320 feet, exceeded that recorded in Bombay, and the daily and monthly range were greater, but considerably less than at Mahabuleshwur at 4500 feet. In four years at Sattaralh the extreme range of the thermometer was 520.5, fromn 500.5 to 1030.0, while at Mahabuleshwur in fifteen years the range was only 47? 0. The minimum temperature does not appear to have been below 50h'5, while I have observed it about the latitude of Sattarah, and at 400 feet lower level, at 400,5 in January; and at 3123 feet in May I had it rise, at 3P.m., to 1050.

The range of the thermometer in fifteen years was 470 FAHR., from 92? in April to 450 in January, but it will be seen that the thermometer exposed to radiation at night had been as low as 270.5, and in every month of the year, excepting the four monsoon months, verged upon the freezing-point; the maximum heat in the sun was 1100 in April andMay, at 9 A.M.) but at midday it had risen to 1270. The extreme daily range never exceeded 230'S, and the maximum monthly range was 380 FAHR. The record of the night thermometer at Mahabuleshwur giving instances of the ternperature in five months of the year sinking below the freezing-point, although it is not described as being placed on the grass or ground, affords an explanation of an otherwise puzzling record in the Dodabetta observations, namely, "on the 15th, 16th, 17th and 22nd of November 1847, found ice around the office " (at sunrise ?), although there is not any record of the thermometer below 450.2 on the 16th at Dodabetta, and in the hourly observations of the 22nd the thermometer only once sank to 480.6 at I1 o'clock at night; the extreme cold, therefore, must have been caused by radiation and evaporation*. An old officer, who had often resided at Mahabuleshwur, tells me that he has frequently witnessed hoar-frost on the ground at Mahabuleshwur, though he had never remarked the thermometer sinking below 450. The highest temperature in the sun at Mahabuleshwur was 1270 in March and May. Dodabetta.-Range of Thermometer.

The lowest temperature in the year was 380.5, the highest 67', and the annual range 28? 5. The greatest monthly range was 240.3. Aqueous Vapour. Preliminary to the discussion of the question of aqueous vapour, a few words are necessary on the caution requisite in generalizing on a limited number of facts, or on observations not extending over lengthened periods of time. The hourly observations of the wet bulb at Madras and Bombay, for 1843 and 1844, are apparently trustworthy and satisfactory, supposing the wet bulb theorem to be correct. Those at Calcutta wvere taken only twice daily, at 911 40m A.M. and 4 P.M., and how far observations, taken twice only during the daytime, can be relied upon for the expression of normal conditions, will best be shown by the following comparison of observations of the wet bulb at Dodabetta at 8640 feet above the sea-level. The regular meteorological observations were recorded twice a day only, at 9h 40"' A.m. and 3" 40m P.m., but on one day in each month independent observations were taken for twenty-four consecutive hours. In a table I have compared the means of the 9h 40m A.M. and 311 40m P.M. observations with the means of the twenty-four consecutive hours for the same day. The discrepancies are considerable, and too numerous to admit of the supposition of their resulting from accident or carelessness. On the 21st and 22nd of January the hourly observations give a depression of the wet bulb of 90.2. The twice a day observations give a depression of 90.4; on the 21st and 22nd of March a depression respectively of 50.7 and 70.7; on the 21st and 22nd of April of 50 2 and 40.2; on the 21st and 22nd of May of 10.8 and 10.33; and on the 21st and 22nd of November of 7`@8 and 60 1. A bare inspection of the several hygrometric records for Dodabetta will show the anomalous results in working out the dew-points, elastic force of vapour, and per-centage of vapour or fraction of saturation in the atmosphere by the tables founded on Dr. APJOHN'S formula. The hourly observations also demonstrate, that on the same day, in a transient fog without rain, there shall not be any depression whatever of the wet bulb; while in the course of the twenty-four hours there may be a great depression. For instance, at noon, on the 21st of December 1847, there was not any depression, but at 9 the next morning there was a depression of 30.2, the mean being 10.6, while the mean of the twenty-four hours was 00.7. At the former hour there was a fog, at the latter, partly a blue skv. Again, at 5 P.M., on the 21st of November, the depression was 10.5, but at 8 P.M. the depression was 100.9, the mean being 60.2, the mean of the twenty-four hours 70.8; in both cases there was nearly a blue sky. At noon, on the 21st of July, there was not any depression in a fog; at 5 A.M. of the 22nd a depression of 20 0, and yet it was raining. On the 21st of April, at 8 P.M., the depression was nil, an hour after it was 50.5; at both hours with nearly a blue sky, while at 7 A.M. of the 22nd the depression was 90.5, with a cloudy sky. Supposing these to have been the only observations available for the respective days, OBSERVATIONS TAKEN IN INDIA. 337 could any of them or their means have been safely taken to express normal conditions'? Professor ORLEBAR, in his Meteorological Observations at Bombay for 1846, gives proofs of the necessity for caution in the ulse of the wet bulb: in the first place, he was obliged to abandon the records of the air-thermometer attached to the wet bulb from the irregular depression of the former, by the cold of the evaporating surface of the latter; and in the next place, on the comparison of the action of two wet bulbs, one inside the observatory and the other outside, he records discrepancies in March ranging from 3? 2 plus to 20 6 minus; the comparisons in April and May exhibited minor discrepancies, excepting on the 27th of April at the 18th hour, when the discrepancy was 30 minus. Professor ORLEBAR having used DANIELL'S hygrometer simultaneously with the wet bulb for eight months in 1846, the means of comparison are afforded, and the following Table exhibits the results.

It would appear, that when the depression of the wet bulb and of DANIELL'S hygrometer is sinall in the monsoon months, their results do not differ very widely, the wet bulb however giving a higher tension of vapour amid greater per-centage of moisture or fraction of saturation in the atmosphere than DANIELL's hygrometer; but in the cold and hot months of the year, MDCCCL. 2 X 338 LIEUT.-COLONEL SYKES'S DISCUSSION OF METEOROLOGICAL this is reversed; considerable discrepancies occur in the results, and the tension of vapour is much higher (with one exception) and the per-centage of moisture much greater by DANIELL'S hygrometer than by the wet bulb, the dew-point by the two instruments differing from 3? to 5?. On the 1st of February, in the morning, the two instruments differ ten per cent. in the amount of moisture in the atmosphere. In the afternoon they differ seven per cent., in both instances DANIELL'S hygrometer giving the greatest amount. On August the 2nd and September the 1st, in the afternoon, the instruments differ above six per cent., but at this period of the year the wet bulb gives the greatest amount of moisture in the atmosphere and DANIELL'S hygrometer the least. The greatest depression of the dew-point in the above observations was 22?`4 on the 1st of May at 3h 12m P.M. In a former paper in the Philosophical Transactions I mentioned a depression of 40', from 67? to 27?, on the 13th of, March 1828 at sun-rise in the Hill Fort of Loghur, and of 61? on the 16th of February 1828 at 4 P.M. at Downde near Pairgaum on the Beema river. I have put into juxtaposition with this table a comparison of the results of hourly observations at Dodabetta of the wet bulb, with the two regular observations made on the same day. In November the simultaneous dew-points by the two processes are 36?`1 and 42?v15; in January 30`7 and 33? 2; in March 430.3 and 39? 6, and in April 420 2 and 400.95. Whether therefore there be 592 or 69 per cent. of moisture in the atmosphere in Nov.einber; 71 or 61 per cent. in March; or 730 or 78h per cent. in April, nothing short of continued hourly observations, like those at Madras and Bombay, will enable the meteorologist to determine.

OBSERVATIONS TAKEN IN INDIA. 339 The natives of the Deccan divide the year into three seasons-the iHewalla (cold), Oonalla (hot), and Pawsalla (wet) seasons; the per-centage of vapour was in the Cold months, Nov., Decen., Jan., Feb. . . . . . . . . . . . 462 per cent. of moisture.

But another uncertainty is the numerical value to be given to the wet bulb readings, whether by APJOHN'S formula or by the means of factors, which Mr. GLAISHER of the Royal Observatory has adopted from a comparison of observations between the wet bulb andi DANIELL'S hygrometer. Dr. MURRAY, in charge of the Sanatariumn at Mahabuleshwur, at 4500 feet, observed with the wet bulb for nine years, and has given the mean monthly depression of the wet bulb for that period in the Journal of the Physical Society of Bombav. He does not give any details of the character of his instruments, or with what precautions he used them, and as from 250 to 300 inches of rain fall at Mahabuleshwur in the S.W. monsoon months, it might have been expected that the air would have been much nearer to a state of saturation in those months than appears to be the case at Dodabetta in the same months, in which only 29 to 30 inches of rain fall. Subjecting these observations to the two methods, it is seen that the results go very well together with small depressions of the wet bulb and at temperatures ranging from 650 to 750, but with depressions above 100 they immediately diverge, and the divergence would increase with greater depressions and at lower temperatures of the air.

With these remarks I proceed to consider the hygrometric features of certain widely separated stations in India, both at the sea-level and elevated at 1800 and 4500 and 8640 feet above the sea. The nmost marked feature is the singularly small monthly mean depression of the wet bulb, the high figures of the elastic force of vapour, and the great percentage of moisture in the atmosphere; not only at the sea-levels of Madras, Bombay, Aden and Calcutta, but at Dodabetta, at 8640 feet above the sea, whether during the monsoons or during the cold and hot months, which are generally supposed to be the dry portion of the year, and the annexed Table exhibits the results. At neither of the Presidencies is there a mean monthly per-centage of vapour at Madras below 67, at Bombay below 66, at Calcutta below 63, and at Dodabetta below 51, while the maximum at Dodabetta goes up to 98, and at Calcutta to 94; at Bombay it did not exceed 88, and at Madras, in two years, it only twice attained a mean maximum of 83 per cent. of moisture in the atmosphere. The mean annual percentage of moisture in the air, it will be seen for the years 1843 and 1844, was at Madras respectively 75 and 74k, at Bombay 76 and 76, at Calcutta 80 and 84, at Aden 71, at Mahabuleshwur 670.9, and at Dodabetta, for 1847-48, it was 900. In the Deccan, in 1827, only 550, as determined by DANIELL'S hygrometer. The difference between the annual mean temperature of the air and the annual mean temperature of the dew-point, wasMadras.

At Calcutta, however, situated sixty miles from the sea, the hygrometric observations make the air much more moist even than at Madras and Bombay. This is contrary to probability, and may be owing to the means of the observations, made only twice a day, not giving the real mean of the twenty-four hours. At the peak or ridges of Dodabetta the air would appear to be nearly in a constant state of saturation; and there is a possibility in the circumstance, considering that it is the highest eminence in the peninsula of India and might be expected Madras.

OBSERVATIONS TAKEN IN INDIA. 341 to attract much vapour, nevertheless the greatest quantity of rain does not fall at Dodabetta. The mean of the hourly observations once a month, and the mean of the two observations daily throughout the year, giving respectively 87 per cent. and 90 per cent. of moisture in the air at Dodabetta, observation and expectation thus go pretty well together, and the records might be satisfactory, were there not doubts about the manipulations with the wet bulb. The hygroinetric observations in the Deccan with DANIELL'S hygrometer, which were taken by myself thrice daily, are quite in accord with the feelings and with the expectations of the observer, excepting for the month of March, in which the feelings indicate the air to be quite as dry as in the months of February or April, but which the hygrometer indicates to be 6 per cent. nearer to saturation than in either February or April. At Aden, in the latitude of Madras, on the arid coast of Arabia, where little rain falls, the mearn monthly and annual per-centage of moisture appears unexpectedly high; the lowest per.centage (603) is in November, and the next lowest 681 and 65respectively in August and September. The maximum percentage was 77' in March, and the mean for the year 71. These results have a certain relation to the phenomena at Madras, which is destitute of a S.W. monsoon. The mean maximum tension of vapour was '902 in May at Aden. The mean monthly and annual results at the several stations have no doubt a certain relation to truth, as it is seen that the percentages of moisture or fractions of saturation in the atmosphere in the different months of the year have an increasing or diminishing amount as the several months approximate to, or recede from, the monsoon months of the year; this is sufficiently shown at Madras, where the monsoon months are the dry months at Bombay and in the Deccan. Nevertheless the amount of moisture in the atmosphere, deduced from. the observations of the wet bulb, is so very great compared with the amount determined by the direct method by DANIELL'S hygrometer (itself an imperfect instrument) in the Deccan, and at some of the stations is so little in accord with personal recollections and experience, that I cannot refrain from suspecting some error of observation, some mismanagement in the manipulations, or a fallacy in the formula by which the dew-point is deduced from the temperature of the wet bulb. The first cause of error that struck me was that arising from the proximity of the dry to the wet bulb, as noticed by Professor ORLEBAR in his Report of Meteorological Observations taken at the Bombay Observatory in 1846. He had a stand erected out of doors, 6 feet high, and with a thatched roof, and every precaution was taken to guard off radiation by layers of cotton and tow upon a board under the roof upon which the meteorologic instruments were placed; there was lateral access' for the air all round. He soon found that the dry bulb, in the neighbourhood of the wet bulb, was almost always depressed below the neighbouring standard thermometer, and that the depression of the drybulb was greater as the depression of the wet bulb below the standard was greater. Professor ORLEBAR explains thlis in the following words :This seems accountable only on the 342 LIEUT.-COLONEL SYKES'S DISCUSSION OF METEOROLOGICAL supposition that heat is extracted from the air to form the shell of moisture round the wet bulb at a distance as far off as the dry bulb." These discrepancies amounted on the 3rd and 14th of November, at the 19th hour, Got. mean time: 0 .0 Standard. . . 82,4 Dry. . . 76'5 Wet bulb. . . 71V8 Diff.. . . 519 Standard 82-4 Dry . . . 75,4 Wet bulb . . . 69'3 Diff.. . . 70 Professor ORLEBAR therefore abandoned observing with the attached dry bulb. But supposing this cause of error to have been overlooked by other observers, the tension of vapour and the percentage humidity would have been recorded by them greatly higher than the truth ; and if we apply this source of error to the mean monthly and annual results in the comparative table I have given;-for instance, to the annual mean for Dodabetta, the 90 per cent. is reduced, for the first difference, to 64 per cent., and if the correction be made for 70, by depression of the dry bulb below a standard owing to its proximity to the wet bulb, the 90 per cent. of moisture at Dodabetta is reduced to 60 per cent. Professor ORLEBAR says the dry bulb always stood below the standard (and he had determined that it was not owing to error in graduation of the thermometers), often to the extent of 20, and even in the monsoon month of September I observe that on the 2nd it was 30.4 minus. . Any amount of error in depression would necessarily affect the numerical determinations of the tension of vapour and degree of humidity; but supposing it not to exceed 20, even this small depression would reduce the 90 per cent. of moisture in the air at Dodabetta to 80 per cent. Supposing therefore that the same error was not discovered at the other places of observation as was discovered in Bombay, there is necessarily some ground for the expression of my doubts, whether the air really did hold at the different stations the quantity of moisture represented by the figures I have elaborated. But Professor ORLEBAR observed another source of error, contingent upon the locality of the wet bulb apparatus, whether placed within doors or out of doors. To determine the amount of error hie placed a wet bulb within the observatory, observing simultaneously with the wet bulb out of doors upon the meteorologic stand. This was done hourly for March, April, and to the 10th of May. The reading was almost always plus with the wet bulb inside; on the 22nd of March, at 19th hour, to the extent of 302, while at 18th hour it had been only 0'2 plus; but there were great irregularities in the readings, being plus or minus dependent apparently upon drafts of air within the observatory, which would depress the wet bulb or raise it. Also the "atmosphere within the room would tend to keep up a reading at any time to whatever it had been at a time preceding," and the latter, Professor ORLEBAR says, was the principal cause of the plus readings in-doors. Supposing this error of 30 to be applied as a correction to the reading of the annual means of the wet bulb at Bombay for 1843, the percentage of moisture in the atmosphere would only be 65 instead of 76. The distin-. guished experimental philosopher REGNAULT has pointed out the same sources of error. He placed the dry and wet bulb in the open air in the court of the College of OBSERVATIONS TAKEN IN INDIA. 343 France, in a closed room in the College, and in the theatre of the College, opening the windows. In the open air, with a temperature ranging from 7?J 16 to 170?88 Centigrade, and a depression ranging from 10.86 to 90.60, the results, by observation and by M. REGNAULT'S tentative formula*, were sufficiently satisfactory; but in the closed chamber he says, "Les fractions de saturation calcul6es avec la formulet, sont ici beaucoup plus fortes que celles que l'on deduit des pesees directes de l'eau renferm6e dans l'air; en d'autres termes la temp6rature t' marquise par le thermometre mouill6 n'est pas assez abaiss6e par la vaporisation de 1'eau que se fait a sa surface pour donner dans la formule la veritable force 6lastique x de la vapeur. Cette circonstance tient evidernment a ce que l'air se trouve beaucoup moins agit6 qu'a l'exterieur."-Page 219. At page 220 M. REGNAULT adds, " Ces experiences dernontrent de la mani~re la plus 6vidente que la form tle ne peut pas rester la mueme pour les divers etats d'agitation de l'air." Here then is a second source of error; and it is somewhat curious that Professor ORLEBAR, in guarding against another grave source of error, which will be adverted to, himself contributes to an error of observation. He had observed the effect of wind blowing upon the wet bulb in unduly depressing the temperature, and to guard against this he says, " As it was equally essential that the bulb of this thermometer should not be exposed to the wind, and that it should be in the same body of air as the air-thermnometer when the latter was exposed to the wind, a small mirror, about an inch square, was put on a little stand, and this being placed upon the tin board could be moved about by the observer into such a position that it might always cut of the wi'ndfrom the bulb of the wet thermometer only" (page lxiii.). Now the wet bulb being thus screened. would be buried in its own vapour and the reading would necessarily be too high. When the air is perfectly calm the same would be the result without the screen, for there would be a shell or coat of saturated air round the bulb. I had occasion to notice this local character of aqueous vapour in my Meteorology of the Deccan, where I constantly witnessed it, as regulated in its distribution by nature. Speaking of dew, I said in the year 1828, "At Marheh in the Pergunnab of Mohol, garden produce (which is usually irrigated during the daytime) was covered with a copious dew every morning; the lands bordering the gar-dens for forty or fifty yards around were slightly sprinkled with it, but there was not a vestige of it in the fields constituting the rising ground north and south of the tract of garden land." Hence I inferred that " aqueous vapour had been taken up by the action of the sun during the day, suspended over the spot, and deposited by the lower temperature at night as dew upon the land in proportion to the supply obtained by day." My tents were within 200 yards of the fields where I observed these phenomena, but from the 1 ith to the 30th of January 182S, there was not any deposition of dew about them, excepting on the 13th of January. In consequence of these observations I was induced* Annales de Chimie, tom. xv. p. 218.0 429(t-t') t _f -l t' H. 344 LIEUT.-COLONEL SYKES'S DISCUSSION OF METEOROLOGICAL to remark particularly the localities of dew at Poona and in its neighbourhood. In September and October 1 found that when there was not a trace of dew in the cantonment, there would be a deposition on the fields of standing grain half a mile distant, and when there was not any dew either in the cantonment or in the fields, it would yet be found on the banks of running rivulets and on the banks of the Mota Mola River; but with respect to the rivulets, "fifteen or twenty feet from the water were the limits of the deposition." I gave numerous other instances of the local deposition of dew proximate to irrigated lands, or in the neiglhbourhood of water, indicating the suspension of vapours over the localities, in complete analogy with what occurs to the wet bulb thermometer when the air is calm. That agitation of the air is necessary to disperse the vapour surrounding a wet bulb, has been noticed by British chemists. BRAND says (page 111, last edition), "' It is now established that the pressure of air is really an obstacle to evaporation, and that a current is useful, not by supplying new quantities of air, but by removing the vapour according as it is formed and leaving fresh spaces into which the vapours may expand." He elsewhere says (page 82), "Evaporation is proportional to the surface exposed; it is also accelerated by agitating the superincumbent air, as in the case of a brisk wind, or by artificial mneans. When the air is tranquil the vapour rests upon the surface of the water, and it is the pressure of its own vapour on the surface of a liquid, and not that of the gaseous atmosphere which stops the process." M. REGNAULT has demonstrated the truth of this in an elaborate manner. Accounting for the different results of observations in a closed and open chamber, he says the wet bulb was not sufficiently depressed in the closed chamber. "Cette circonstance tient evidemment a ce que l'air se trouve beaucoup moins agite qu'a l'exterieur*." After experimenting in a room with two windows open, he adds, as before stated, "Ces experiences de'montrent de la maniere la plus evidente que la formule ne petit pas rester la meme pour divers 6tats d'agitation de l'air." (P. 220.) The vapour therefore resting upon the wet bulb is a source of error, but the removal of it leads to one much more grave. M. REGNAULT, in reference to M. AUGUST'S formula, says (p. 207), "C La formule ne tient aucun compte de la vitesse du courant d'air; d'apres cette formule, la difference de temp6rature devrait etre la meme, quelle que soit cette vitesse. Ce r6sultat parait impossible 'a priori. Jai cherche a determiner par des expdriences directes, l'influence de cette vitesse et "a reconnaitre si, a partir d'une certaine valeur de la vitesse, les diff~rences de temperature des thermombtres see et mouille deviendraient independentes de la vitesse absolue du courant d'air, consequence a laquelle on se trouve naturellemnent conduit par le raisonnement que M. AUGUST applique au calcul de la formule du psychrom~tre." M. REGNAULT then describes his apparatus and mode of making his experiments. He gives two series of experiments; in the second experiment the air being made to blow upon the wet bulb with a greater velocity than in the first. It will be sufficient'to give the first and sixth figures of each series.* Annales de Chinie, tom. xv. p. 219.

In the second series the temperature of the wet bulb is reduced from 100.78 to 80 56, and the difference between the wet and dry is increased from 100-70 to 13? 14, while the temperature of the dry bulb is only raised 0`?22. Upon these A experiments M. REGNAULT says, QOn voit que, pour une meme temperature t les temperatures t' dependent beaucoup de la vitesse du courant d'air" (p. 209); and he further says (p. 210) that these depressions are less than he has found on other occasions with an increased velocity of the air; and on using dry air he found the depression t-t'= 130.52 instead of 50.91, and another depression of 150,60 instead of 80.60. M. REGNAULT gives other experiments, and finishes by saying, " II r6sulte de tout ce qui vient d'etre dit, que l'agitation de l'air doit exercir une influence tr~ssensible sur les indications du psychrometre" (p. 211). The truth of M. REGNAULT'S experiments are borne out by the experience of families in the Deccan (and no doubt elsewhere) in India in the fair season, who cool their wine and beer by the following simple process down to a temperature the cold of which makes the teeth ache in drinking. At any time of the day a thick layer of straw is put down on the ground in the shade of a building, but not in the lee of the wind. The bottles of wine or beer to be cooled are put upon the straw, some more straw is thinly and lightly shaken over the prostrate bottles, and the mass is sprinkled at intervals with water through the nozzle of a watering-pot with very fine apertures, thus dewing as it were the straw; the force of evaporation and the consequent cold is proportioned to the velocity and dryness of the wind; but even with a moderate wind the temperature of the liquors is soon greatly lowered; and in certain hot and therefore patching winds, even at a temperature of the air ranging from 850 to 900 FAHR., I have often, at Ahmednugger, had the temperature of the wine or beer (judging from my sensations at the moment) approaching to the freezing-point+. In this cooling process we have * to Temperature of dry thermometer. t' Temperature of wet bulb. t My sensations deceived me. While this paper is going through the press, I have received from a friend, commanding the Artillery at Ahmednlugger, the following results of experiments he made at my request, with MDCCCTL.2 346 LIEUT.-COLONEL SYKESS DISCUSSION OF METEOROLOGICAL the bottle of wine or beer corresponding to the bulb of the thermometer; the straw lying thinly over it represents the muslin, and the operations of the watering-pot complete the wet bulb apparatus, evaporation does the rest; but as the velocity and dryness of the wind regulate this, it is plain that such an instrument can only give uncertain and fallacious results when used to determine, with any pretension to accuracy, the fractional saturation of the atmosphere. I come now to a source of error in my reductions of the wet bulb observations which I have collected in this paper from various parts in India, a source of error that may operate with a greater or less power as the depression of the wet bulb is greater or less. I allude to the formula used for the reductions of the readings of the wet bulb. M. REGNAULT says that M. GAY-LussAc was the first to propose the determination of the dew-point by the observations of a dry and wet bulb apparatus *, but that to effect the object satisfactorily it would require extensive observations upon which to found tables. Subsequently to the period of M. GAY-LussAc's proposition, AUGUST, Professor at Berlin, occupied himself with the subject and published some papers, in which he sought to determine, upon theoretical considerations, the formula by which the elastic force of aqueous vapour, really existing in the air, could be found by the difference of temperature of a dry and wet bulb thermometer. The dry and wet bulb apparatus he called a Psychrom~tre. His chief memoir is published in the Annalen der Physik und Chemie, V. Band. Leipzig, 1825. It will suffice to say that lie considered the wet bulb surrounded at all times with a coat of vapour of the same temperature as the bulb, which was, he stated, necessarily lower than that of the surrounding air,that the successive supplies of air coming into contact with the wet bulb, parted with a portion of their heat and took the temperature of the wet bulb; but on the other hand, the air so supplied in vaporizing the water upon the surface of the wet bulb took from it a portion of its heat; and a stationary state of the temperature of the wet bulb was established by these two quantities of heat balancing each other. AUGUST'S formula was x= t-) h where t denotes the tempe1 + (t 11) I + (t-/i) rature of the dry bulb (in Centigrade degrees), t' the temperature of the wet bulb, y the specific heat of dry air, b the density of aqueous vapour, ?X the latent heat of aqueous vapour between the temperatures t and t', z the specific heat of vapouir, h the height of the barometer, f the elastic force of vapour in saturated air at the temperature t', and x the elastic force of the vapour actually existing in the atmnosphere; xf' and h being expressed 'in inches, or in tertms of any common unit.the wet straw process, on the 21st of May 1850, and preceding days.

OBSERVATIONS TAKEN IN INDIA. 347 With assumed values for y, B and ?x, as the real values are not accurately known, and neglecting small quantities, and supposing =r-, AUGUST'S formula became =/ o 460-428(t -1t)h x~f640-t for the determination of the elastic force and consequently the dew-point, and after certain comparisons of the dewpoint from his formula with the direct dew-point from DANIELL'S hygrometer, he found what he considered a sufficient agreement between them. In a comparative table* of the results by his formula and the results by DANIELL'S hygrometer, they appear to go pretty well together, while the variations of temperature and of the depression of the wet bulb are small; but the moment the temperature exceeds 200 Centigrade (680 FAHR.), and the depression exceeds 50 (90 FAHR.), the discrepancy is very considerable; for instance, at bar. 755-3 inillims. (291736 inches), dry 28`5 (83'-3 FAHR.), wet 210.1 (69 98 FAHR.), depression 70.4 (130-32 FAHR.), the tension of vapour by the formula is 14-181 millims. (Q558 in. =dew-point 620), and by DANIELL'S hYgrometer 12-087 milli ns. (-475 in.=dew-point 57? 15), the difference 2-094 millims (-083 in.). Even with a depression of onlv 0-6 (1W.08 FAHR.) the tension of vapour by the formula and by DANIELL is respectively 8-612 inillimns. ( 339 in.), and 8-534 inillimns. (335 in.), diffe-ence 0-078. These discrepancies induced M. REGNAULT to modify, in 1845, nearly twenty years afterwards, AUGUST'S formula, and he in common with AUGUST assumed y=0-2669, _=0-622 and z=y, but ?k=610-t. Substituting these numbers and neglecting small quantities, the formula became x=f'_0429 (t-t') h, and it is this fornula that 6 10-1'ht n t sti oruata M. REGNAULT tests by his various experiments; and at the close of his able and elaborate paper he says, " Je ne pense pas que l'on puisse admettre comme base du calcul du psychrometre l'hypothese fondamentale adopt6e par AUGUST: a" savoit, que tout l'air qui fournit de la chaleur au thermometre mouille descend jusqu'a la temp6rature t' indiquee par celui-ci, et se sature comnplktement d'humidit6. Il me parait probable que la portion de l'air que se refroidit ne descend pas jusqu'ah t', et qu'elle ne se sature pas d'humidite. Le rapport de la quantite de chaleur que l'air enleve a la boule par vaporisation de l'eau, a la quantit6 de chaleur qu'il perd en se refroidissant, est probablemient d'autant plus grand que cet air est plus see, parceque dans cet etat, il est beaucoup plus avide d'humidite que quand il approche de son etat de saturation. " Enfin, la temperature de la boule mouill6e est influencee encore autrement que par F'air immemdiatement ambient, elle est soumise au rayonneinent de l'enceinte dont l'influence sera variable suivant l'etat d'agitation de l'air. "Il me parait impossible de faire entrer toutes ces circonstances dans le calcul thdoretique de l'instrument; est je crois qu'il est plus sage de ne faire servir les considerations theoretiques qu'a la iecherche de la forme de la fonction, et h determiner ensuite les constantes par des expdriences faites dans les conditions d6termine'es. Cette* Annalen der Physik, B. v. p. 87.2 y 2 348 LIEUT.-COLONEL SYKES'S DISCUSSION OF METEOROLOGICAL maniere d'op6rer me parait d'autant plus necessaire, qu'il reste beaucoup d'incertitude sur plusieurs des dlements nurmriques que entrent dans le calcul, notamnment sur la chzaleur spdcjfquede 1'air, sur celle de la vapeur, et sur la chaleur absorbee par l'eau lorsqu'elle se vaporise dans l'air."-(P. 212.) These are the opinions of M. REGNAULT expressed twenty years after AUGUST had invented his formula, and after his own elaborate experiments; and I have preferred giving them in his own language to free myself from any possible misconstruction in translation. M. REGNAULT thought that AUGUST's formula modified by him, would meet some of the difficulties expressed by him in the above quoted opinions, and he gives tables of results, which, with a limited range of the thermometer and small depressions, are sufficiently satisfactory; but he candidly admits ;l'accord a et6 beaux coup moins parfait dans les bas temperatures et dans l'air trbs humide ;" in these cases M. REGNAULT says the fractions of saturation calculated are always above the fractious of saturation obtained by direct means, often to a very notable extent. M. REGNAULT got one of his pupils to try the psychrometer, under considerably diminished pressure, on the mountains in Switzerland, but the results were so little satisfactory that he does not give a detail of them. He induced also his friend M. IZARN, to compare the readings of the wet bulb in the Pyrenees, at a pressure of 700 millims. (27-559 in.), with the readings of an hygrometer invented by himself, which he calls " hygromkre condenseur," and which lie considers to be free from. the objections to which DANIELL'S hygrometer is subject; and in a table given, the fractions of saturation are almost always much higher by the wet bulb than by the condenser, the depression in no case exceeding 3? 91. In a depression of 10`97, the differences of the fraction of saturation are respectively 0-7542 and 017937. Finally, M. REGNAULT says that his modified formula may give the elastic force of x a little too high, and that the coefficient 0A480 might be used instead when the fiaction of saturation exceeds 0-40 Centigrade, but that the coefficient 0A429 gives results nearer to the truth where the fraction of saturation is below 0A40. When the wet bulb descends below zero, he considers that the value of X should be increased from 610 to 689, but in the present imperfect knowledge of the true numerical value of several of the elements he will not venture to put forth a new formula for the psychrometer (p. 227).

On the 24th of November 1 834 and 27th of April 1835, Dr. APJOHN of Dublin read to the Royal Irish Academy a very elaborate and able paper upon the theory of the moist bulb hygrometer.

FAHR. to 170? FAHR. for 30? of depression of the wet bulb by tenths, and for variations of pressure from 19 inches to 31 inches. It was these tables I used in the reduction of the preceding wet bulb observations; and it was in the progress of their use, during several months' labour, that at certain temperatures doubts were raised in my mind respecting the accuracy of the formula, from supposing the fraction of saturation unreasonably high when the depression of the wet bulb was inconsiderable, and unreasonably low when the depression of the wet bulb was considerable. The tension of vapour at considerable depressions startled me, until at last I found in testing the tables that with a depression of the wet bulb of 190 at a temperature of 52? FAHR., and at a pressure of 29 or 30 inches, the results became impossible; that is to say, the tension of vapour of the dew-point arrived at by the formula had a greater numerical value than the tension of vapour at the temperature of the wet bulb, e. g.

For instance, in the records on the 6th of April 1845, at 6 P.M., the dry bulb was 520.6, wet bulb 39'-2, and dew-point by DANIELL'S hygrometer 22?. The depression of the wet bulb being 13'.4, the dew-point by APJOHN'S formula would be 14', by GLAISHER'S factors 25? 8, and by DANIELL'S hygrometer it is found to be 22?. Which of these dew-points is to be taken to give the real numerical value of the tension of vapour? At Greenwich, on the 3rd of June 1846, at 4 P.M., the dry bulb was 79? 1, and the dew-point by DANIELL'S hygrometer 440, the depression therefore 351. But I have recorded in the Meteorology of the Deccan, a depression of 610 of DANIELL'S hygrometer taking place before the deposition of dew; the temperature of the air being 900, the dew-point 29?, at 4 P.M., on the 16th of February 1828, at Downd, near Pairgraon, on the Beema River*. Mr. GLAISHER, of the Royal Observatory, a most persevering and able observer, finding from experience that the formulae in use with a constant coefficient did not give satisfactorily the dew-points at varying temperatures and varying depressions of the wet bulb, adopted a series of factors quite independent of theory, from the results of very extensive comparisons of simultaneous observations of the wet bulb with DANIELL'S hygrometer. These comparisons extended over several years, and through several thousand observations. He found that " the dew-point temperature was so related to the temperatures of air and evaporation, that at the same temperature of the air, the difference of temperatures of air and of the dew-point, divided by the difference of the temperature of the air and evaporation, was constant, but that it was different at every different temperature." Arranging several thousand observations made during five years at Greenwich, and during three years at Toronto, and taking the mean value at every degree of temperature, he obtained a series of factors ranging from 8'5 at temperatures below 240FAHR., up to 1V5 above 700 FAHR.; these were published in the volume of the Greenwich Magnetical and Meteorological Observations for 1842, 1843 and 1844. In 1847 Mr. GLAISHER published hygrometrical tables in which soine slight alterations of the original factors were made, and he has since made some further slight modifications. For the limited range in temperature, depression of the wet bulb and pressure, in which the comparisons were made and the factors deduced, they are probably the very best agents (at least above the freezing-point) for giving a close approximation to the true value of the readings of the wet bulb; supposing always the wet bulb not to be subjected to the anomalous indications noticed by Professor ORLEBAR and M. REGNAULT. For considerable differences of barometrical pressure, and very considerable depressions of the wet bulb, the factors would require further correction. When the dew-point was obtained with difficulty by DANIELL'S hygrometer, or in other words, when the depression of the temperature of evaporation was great, Mr. GLAISHER found that his method of determining his factors would not hold good, which he attributed to certain objec-* Philosophical Transactions, Part I. for 1835, p. 184. OBSERVATIONS TAKEN IN INDIA. 351 tions to DANIELL'S hygrometer, and to which it is no doubt subject, but which are applicable to all temperatures and all depressions, objections which were urged by M. REGNAULT, and which induced him to invent his "3hygrometre condenseur," an instrument which he pronounces to be free from the errors of DANIELL'S instrument, but the use of which I have not heard of in England. I have thus reviewed, in extenso, the possible, indeed the probable sources of error in the very high degree of humidity constantly in the air, as represented by the wet bulb observations made in India, and I have no hesitation in expressing my belief that the results, which I have obtained with the labour of some months, do not represent the real fractions of saturation of the air at the several places where the wet bulb was observed*; and I amn the more confirmed in this opinion, with respect to the Neelgherries, by an officer now in London, who resided some time at Ootacamund and kept a meteorological register, who says that if the mean annual moisture in the air had amounted to anything like 90 per cent. it must have been most inconveniently felt in the clothes, hats, bedding and furniture of the residents; but so far from. such being the case, that, with the exception of occasional fogs, the hills were looked upon as rather dry than otherwise. From. my doubts respecting the correctness of the deduced fraction of saturation of the air at places in India, with the formulae I have passed in review, I may possibly except the observations made in the Deccan with DANIELL'S hygrometer, which observations have a semblance of truth, although the instrument may be imperfect. Even with a comparatively low mean annual percentage of 55 of moisture in the air, I would say such fraction of saturation was rather higher than the truth, for during some months of the year in the Deccan the air is so dry that it is difficult to prevent the disposition of the leaves of tables to curl up into hollow cylinders, and the nib of a quill pen is always most provokingly straddling out into the form of a pair of open compasses. By reason of the above-noticed sources of error in the wet bulb itself, and of the inadequacy of the formulae to give a satisfactory value to its readings, supposing the indications to be correct, I have deliberately not applied any corrections to the readings of the barometer on account of moisture. But even had the instrument been free from error and the formulaw exact, I still should have deemed it ineffectual to attempt to measure the moisture in a whole column of the atmospherefrom a local observationf with a view to apply to the barometer, which represents the pressure of an entire column of the atmosphere, a correction for the tension of vapour+. Further, I have doubts of the propriety of applying to the barometer a correction for* Dr. MCLELLAND says, " The wet bulb thermometer would add greatly to the value of these results, but there are discrepancies in the register of the instrument in use (at Calcutta) which prove it to be imperfect." -Calcutta Journal of Nat. Hist., vol. v. p. 554. t "I This instrument [wet bulb] simply indicates the conditions of the air of the place where it is situated: at 100 feet above it the conditions may be very different."-GLAISHER's Hygrometrical Tables, p. 16, edition of 1847. + The capacity of air to hold water in solution, or in a state of vapour, diminishes with the temperature. 352 LIEUT.-COLONEL SYKES'S DISCUSSION OF METEOROLOGICAL moisture subtractively, even were the tension of vapour satisfactorily determined for the whole pressure. The barometerfalls with increasing saturation of the atmosphere with moisture, indicating the displacement of comparatively dry air by dilated vapour, the density of which is less than that of drier air, and a certain amount of pressure is taken off the barometer and the mercury falls on account of the diminished density and elasticity of humid air; but as soon as this vapour is condensed into rain the drier air resumes its ordinary density and elasticity, and the mercury mounts again. If the vapour came simply as an addition to the drier air, the density and pressure of the compound should increase, and the barometer should rise; but this is contrary to fact. I would therefore not apply a subtractive correction for that vapour, which has already acted directly upon the barometer in diminishing pressure by displacing denser air. The object of applying any corrections at all to the barometer, on account of moisture in the atmosphere, is stated to be to "obtain from them the pressure of the atmosphere of dry air*;" but as such a state of the air is a physical impossibility as long as there is a drop of water upon the earth to be vaporized, as evaporation goes on at all temperatures, it may be asked, what practical advantage can be obtained from any such determination? and the more so, may the question be asked, when experimenters are not in accord with respect to the numerical values of the tension of vapour at different temperatures to be applied as correctionst. On the whole it appears very desirable that to DIRECT MEANS recourse should always be had, if possible, for the determination of the dew-point, to DANIELL'S hygrometer, or to REGNAULT'S condensing hygrometer; and short of this, that persevering comparisons should be made for years, in extended ranges of temperature, depression and pressure, and at different elevations, to obtain a more trustworthy wet bulb formula, or an unquestionable series of factors. Rain. If it were necessary to suggest caution in generalizations from a limited number of local observations for the determination of the dew-point, caution is equally, if not more necessary in attempting to fix the normal rain-fall even in a narrow area, much less in a district or province. For instance, within the limits of part of the small island of Bombay, seven miles by two miles, the following is the result of observations with nine rain-gauges. The Fort and Esplanade are necessarily proximate; the Observatory at Colabah two miles distant, and the most remote gauge at the Government House at Parell, only five miles from the Fort, the other stations being intermediate between the Fort and Parell.* GLAISHER's Hygrometrical Tables, p. 12, edition of 1847. t At 320 FAHR.

I do not know whether the investigations were carried out for a whole monsoon, but in case the discrepancies continued, it would be difficult to determine the normal fall of rain in Bombay. But the anomaly is not confined to Bombay; Dr. MURRAY, in a paper published in the Journal of the Physical Society of Bombay, No. 9, p. 172, has the following * Gauge overflowed. t No register kept for first thirteen days-4 inches set down at guess. + Gauge overflowed. ? The gauge was running over, but this seems pretty nearly all that fell. It poured in torrents from 5 P.M. on the 25th till 6 A.M. 26th. llThe difference here is the same as last month (twice as much of fall being set down here as fell everywhere else); and so enormous and unaccountable as to lead to the inference of some tremendous blunder.: MDCCCL. 2 z 354 LIEUT.-COLONEL SYKES'S DISCUSSION OF MIETEOROLOGICAL observations respecting the fall of rain in the town of Sattarah and military cantonment adjoining: "The quantity of rain in the town of Sattarah usually exceeds that in the cantonment, situated a mile N.E., by 6 or 8 inches." Annexed are the results, to which he has added the fall at his own bungalow or house. equidistant between the town and cantonment, so that the three localities are within the range of a mile.

The facts show how necessary is a local knowledge of physical features before generalizations can be ventured upon safely. In my former paper in the Philosophical Transactions I pointed out the remarkable differences in the fall of rain, twenty to twenty-five years ago on the sea coast, at the top of the Ghats, and at Poona, thirty-five miles to the eastward of the Ghats.

OBSERVATIONS TAKEN IN INDIA. 355 -Dr. MURRAY adds, "The prodigious influence of the Ghhts in modifying the amount of the S.W. monsoon rain, is perhaps nowhere more strikingly shown than in the N.W. parts of the Sattarah territory. If we draw a line nearly straight from west to east, from Mahabuleshwur, on the summit of the Ghats, to Phultun, a distance of little more than forty miles, we shall find at the commencement of the line a rain-fall of 240 inches, at an altitude of 4500 feet; 180 inches at Sindola, a mile distant, and elevated 4600 feet; 50 inches at Paunchgunnee, at a further distance of eleven miles and an elevation of 4000 feet; 25 inches at Wye, four miles further east and 2300 feet in height above the sea, while at the extremity of the line at Phultun, thirty miles from Sattarah, and about the same level as Wye, the quantity is reduced to 7 or 8 inches." But Dr. MURRAY must have meant during the S.W. monsoon, as he had previously represented the fall of rain at Phultun at 24-18 in. in 1848, in 1847 at 24,04 in., and in 1846 at 18,09 in. Some inches of those amounts however are attributable to the Madras monsoon, which commences in October, when the Malabar coast monsoon terminates, and Phultun, from its easterly position, gets an uncertain sprinkling from the Madras side. Dr. MURRAY, with a view to show not only the discrepancies in the total annual fall of rain at places within comparatively limited distances situated on the plateau of the Deccan, but the remarkable contrasts in the monthly fall at two proximate places, has given the following Table of the fall of rain at Sattarah and Phultun for 1846 and 1847, Phultun being thirty miles east of Sattarah Sattarah.

He states (page 18), "At the Sanatanium at Mahabuleshwur, at 4500 feet, the rain-fall during 1848 was 245 inches, being within 3 inches of the average fall during the preceding twenty years. At Sindola, the residence of Mr. FRERE (the IBritishn minister), situated a mile east from 2 z2 356 LIEUT.-COLONEL SYKES'S DISCUSSION OF METEOROLOGICAL the Sanatarium, about 100 feet higher, with the intervening eminence of Mount Charlotte rising to a further height of 100 feet, the quantity of rain did not exceed 185 inches during the same period; hence a difference of 60 inches or 24 per cent. at two houses situated at the same station. The position of the ground explains the difference, but probably few people, on examining the localities, would have anticipated its amount. It shows the supreme importance of instituting multiplied observations, before deciding on the site of a sanitary hill station." To add to the means of comparison, some other rain-fall localities from the seacoast, and Konkun, or country between the GhAts and the sea,-from the Ghats and from the plateau of the Deccan, are annexed, being the mean fall for the years 1844-47.

Kundalla is on the crest of the Ghats on the high road from Bombay to Poona. The places in the Deccan lie eastward of the Ghats. Arranging the above places according to their supply of rain, it appears the greatest fall is on the crest of the Ghhts, increasing from 141-59 inches at Kundalla at 1740 feet to a mean fall of 254-84 inches at Mahabuleshwur, at 4500 feet. From the crest of the Ghats the supply of rain decreases towards the sea-coast westward, but decreases in an infinitely greater ratio eastward on the plateau of the Deccan. Along the coast the supply of rain diminishes with the increase in latitude. In further illustration of the unequal fall of rain in the Bombay Presidency, the returns for May, June and July 1849 are annexed. They are the latest I have received except fiom Bombay.

Of the three stations on the Tinnevally or Coromandel coast, Shenkottah is near Courtallum, immediately at the east base of the Ghats, and about sixty miles from the sea-coast of Travancore; Palamcottah is about thirty miles from the east base of the Ghats, is sixty miles from the western coast, and in the latitude, of Quilon; Vaurioor is only three miles north and a little east of Cape Cornorin. The western and eastern stations are separated by the Ghats, which in some places rise to a height of 6000 feet, but within ten miles of Cape Comorin they break off into separate groups and peaks of greatly diminished height. Bearing in mind the preceding extraordinary discrepancies, not only in the annual and monthly fall of rain in the same locality and in proximate localities, I proceed to place in juxtaposition the fall of rain at various places in India, from such returns as are within my reach, from places at the sea-level and at different elevations above the sea-level; and it may well be a question how far even the means of many years' observations in any one locality, exhibit normal conditions for the fall of rain in circumscribed areas, much less for districts or provinces. The relative positions of the stations on the Malabar and Coromandel coasts having been previously stated, it only remains to notice the places somewhat inland. Poona, at 1823 feet, is about forty miles eastward of the western scarp of the GhAts, and about sixty miles as the crow flies from the sea-shore. Kotergherry, at 6100 feet, is part of the Neelgherry mountains, and lies a little to the eastward of the ridges of Dodabetta at a lower level of 2340 feet. Dodabetta is part of the Neelgherries, and the highest point of the peninsula of India. Mahabuleshwur, Mercara and Uttra Mallay, at the common level of 4500 feet, are nearly in the same meridian, but lie between 90 and 180 north latitude, and are situated near to the western scarp of the Ghats. (See annexed Table.) The first feature of this Table is the almost total want of rain at every station in the month of February, with the exception of Kotergherry and Dodabetta, and it may be accounted for by this month being intermediate between the times of the S.W. and N.E. monsoons; the former, on the Malabar coast, commencing in May and ending in October, and the latter commencing on the Coromandel coast in October and ending in January. The other two intermediate months, March and April, have very limited falls of rain, excepting at Kotergherry, Uttray Mullay and Dodabetta, at which places the supply is very liberal; indeed at Kotergherry and Dodabetta the maximum monthly fall of the year appears to occur in April, a month that belongs to neither the Malabar nor Coromandel mnonsoons, but as the wind at Dodabetta was almost entirely from northerly and easterly points, the supply of rain may be more reasonably considered to appertain to the tail of the N.E., rather than to the commencement of the S.W. monsoon. Poona, at 1823 feet, and Mahabuleshwur in the Deccan and Mercara in Coorg, at 4500 feet, have scarcely a sprinkling from the N.E. monsoon, and the months of December, January, February, March and April, may be Calcutta, 18 feet.

OBSERVATIONS TAKEN IN INDIA. 359 considered their dry months; but Mercara, lying much further south than Mahabuleshwur, would appear to benefit slightly from the terminal falls of the N.E. monsoon, or from the preliminary squalls of the S.W. monsoon. On the eastern or Coromandel coast, the months that are comparatively dry (or rather destitute of rain, for the wet bulb won't admit them to be dry) on the western coast, are necessarily the reverse of the eastern, and we thus see October, November, Deceinber and January, at Madras, and the other stations on the east coast, with a monthly fall of rain ranging from 0G90 to 15 13 inches. The mean annual fall at Madras, for twenty-two years, from 1822 to 1843, ranges from 18 45 inches in 1832 to 88-68 inches in 1827. Calcutta, although within the regular S.W. monsoon, appears to benefit more from the Coromandel monsoon in January than any other of the stations noticed in the Table. The Tables indicate that as the stations approximate towards each other, and lie nearer to the apex of the triangular-formed peninsula of India, excepting at Cape Comorin, so do they respectively benefit in an increasing ratio from the monsoons of either coast. For instance, Madras derives considerable advantage from the Malabar monsoon in the months of July, August and September, while Cochin, Quilon, Allepy and Trevandruln, on the Malabar coast, and the mountain stations of Uttray Mullay, Kotergherry and Dodabetta, lying between the Malabar and Coromandel coasts, are liberally supplied from the N.E. monsoon in the months of October, November and December, while Mercara and Mahabuleshwur, similarly situated as Uttray Mullay and Dodabetta, but in a higher latitude, and nearly in the same meridian, derive scarcely any benefit frotn the N.E. monsoon; indeed, north of the eighteenth parallel of latitude, that is to say of Poona, the rain-fall of the N.E. monsoon does not extend, at least as far as the returns I have been able to collect afford me the means of judging. Another feature of the Table indicates that the S.W. monsoon does not burst simultaneously along the whole line of the Malabar coast, but would appear to creep up slowly from Allepy towards Bombay, commencing in fact on the coast of Travancore partly in April, but absolutely in May, and rarely, if ever, commencing in Bombay before the first week in June; the S.W. monsoon therefore on the coast of Travancore and Malabar, precedes the time of its occurrence at Bombay by a month at least. I had thought that along the coast the quantity of rain diminished as the latitude increased, and the large annual fall at Allepy and Cochin, compared with the -fall at Bombay, seemed to justify the opinion; but the fall at Cape Comorin, Trevandrum and Quilon, does not justify the opinion; and supposing that any such law held good on the Malabar coast, it plainly has not any existence on the Coromandel coast. It is certain, however, that as the tropic is approached on the western side of India, the annual fall of rain sensibly diminishes along the coasts of Kattywar and Cutch; and at the mouths of the Indus, not only is there no trace of the S.W. monsoon, but Lower Scinde would appear to resemble those singular tracts on the earth, the Deserts of Sahara and Gobi, and the coast of Chili, denominated " rainless." I regret not having been enabled to get more than one re360 LIEUT.-COLONEL SYKES'S DISCUSSION OF METEOROLOGICAL gular meteorological register from the military cantonment at Kurrachee, situated near one of the mouths of the Indus; but the scanty information supplied to me affords sufficient proof that if Lower Scinde does not belong absolutely to the rainless districts, it approaches very nearly to them. Unfortunately, neither in the large cantonment at Kurrachee, nor at other stations in Scinde, up to 1849 were regular meteorological registers kept, excepting perhaps for mere temperature, or if kept they were not made available to the public. Casual observations have been made and sufficient attention paid to the rain-fall, or rather the absence of it, to enable us to say definitely, that to Lower Scinde the S.W. monsoon, in its usual sense, does not extend, and that the country does not appear to have other sources of supply. The following Table is arranged from the details in a letter dated Kurrachee, July 6th, 1848, noticing the occasional showers that fell from April 1847, a pluviometer having been set up, but apparently for very little purpose Register of Rain at Kurrachee, from April 1847 to July 1848. 1 1847. 1848.

It thus appears, -if the register be correct that in fifteen months only two showers occurred, and those so light as not to be appreciable by the pluviometer. The following extract from a subsequent letter, dated 1st of September 1849, to a certain extent is in harmony with the previous record: "We have had a few smart showers lately. Ever since June it has been constantly threatening rain; the sky has been always overcast, and both in July and August showers fell, but the whole fall for the season has hardly amounted to 3 inches; and yet in Upper Scinde, at Mooltan, in the Punjab, and generally in India, where the S.W. monsoon prevails, the usual averages have in some places been doubled." In this year, at Bombay, the unusual quantity of 1 18 88 inches fell. The only other part of Scinde from which I have any record is from Kotri near to Hlyderabad on the Indus, and the return transmitted to me is annexed. The public duties of the observer called him occasionally away from his station and prevented a continuous record, and. it is only for 1846. that a year's observations are complete, and in 1847 four months were omitted.

I am enabled, however, since the preceding notices were written, by the arrival in England of the medical returns from the Bombay army for 1847, to give an official and authentic record of the rain-fall and temperature at Kurrachee for 1847. It will be seen that for eleven months not a single shower fell, and that in one month only did rain fall, the record being in accord so far with the letter dated 6th of July 1848, differing, however, inasmuch as the rain in the official report is represented to have fallen in June and the latter in July.

MDCCCL. 3 A 362 LIEUT,-COLONEL SYKES'S DISCUSSION OF METEOROLOGICAL while a few miles from Cape Comorin the annual supply amounts to 113 inches; and in the latitude of Bombay it does not fall below a mean of 76 82 inches for the monsoon alone, but proceeding along the coast northwards the supply further diminishes, or becomes irregular and uncertain in quantity, and at the mouths of the Indus almost disappears. Along the Coromandel coast the N.E. monsoon does not appear to supply much more than one-half of the fall on the Malabar coast, the mean of twenty-two years at Madras being 44'57 inches, the quantity slightly increasing with the latitude from Cape Comorin. Another marked feature is the greatly increased fall of rain with the increased elevation above the sea-level of the place of observation up to a certain height, beyond which the quantity of rain gradually diminishes as the place of observation is more elevated; at least such are the indications in the tract of land which lies between the sea-shore and ,the base of the Ghats between Cape Comorin and Goozerat, and along the western face of the Ghats themselves. The observation does not hold good however on the elevated lands to the eastward of the crest of the Bombay and Malabar Ghats. Along the sea-coast the falls vary from 28-35 inches at Cape Comorin to 113,26 inches at Allepy, but increase at stations nearing the Ghats at different elevations to more than 300 inches at 4500 feet, and above that height the falls gradually diminish in quantity.

The comparative small fall at Mercara is accounted for by the fact of its not being so near the western scarp of the Ghats as Mahabuleshwur arid Uttray Mullay, and the effect of a station being placed a few * Since the above was written I have received a letter from General CULLEN, dated Trevandrum, 6th of January 1850, giving an account of the fall of rain for 1849 at the Uttray Mullay range. inches.

In 1849 the contrast was still greater, the fall at Mahabuleshwur amounting to the enormous quantity of 338*38 inches, while at Paunchgunny only 58 inches fell. Rain at different Elevations. Mr. MILLER, in his Meteorology of the Lake Districts of Cumberland and Westmoreland, has adduced sufficient evidence to prove that the same law, if it be a law, obtains in England in mountainous districts, but Mr. MILLER'S elevation of maximum fall is about 2000 feet instead of 4500, as in India. This difference no doubt results from the differences of latitude and consequent mean temperature, and would indicate that the stratum of vapour supplying the maximum quantity of rain floats at a less height beyond the tropics than within them. In a communication from Mr. MILLER, dated June 7, 1849, he gives as follows the fall of rain at different heights in the Lake Districts of Cumberland and Westmoreland. "The Mountain Gauges.

In Borrowdale also, in a field adjoining a garden, in the years 1847 and 1848, the fall was in excess in the garden of 2-44 inches and 3-67 inches respectively. These facts suggest caution to all observers in other parts of England and elsewhere. Professor PHILLIPS for some years made observations at York on the top of the Minster, the Museum, and on the ground, to determine the effect of elevation upon the rain-fall, but objections being taken to the results in respect to eddies of wind and other causes of error, he lifted rain-gauges into the air, independently of buildings, and the results of the observations for the years 1843 and 1844 he communicated to the British Association at York in 1844. The sums of the rain-fall in the two years at different heights were,inches. 21 feet. . . 24-158 12 feet . . 26-039 6 feet. 26* 109 3 feet . 26-298 12 foot. 26-559 The nearer the earth, therefore, the greater the amount of rain collected. Mr. MILLER's records at Whitehaven, giving for four years the amount of rain collected in the High Street and on the Church Steeple, confirm Professor PHILLIPS'S observations, supposing the steeple to be 78 feet above the High Street. At Calcutta, in the OBSERVATIONS TAKEN IN INDIA. 365 Surveyor-General's Office, similar observations were made at the respective heights of 4 feet and 40 feet, and I have inserted the results in the general rain-fall Table for four years. The sums were respectively 261'97 inches and 247A41 inches, and the annual means 65A49 inches and 61V85 inches. Dr. BUIST states that at the observatory in Bombay, in two rain-gauges, one at -3 feet from the ground, and the other above the observatory at 32 feet, the inches.

The supposed law may hold good for small differences in elevation on the plains, but the law is reversed in mountainous districts. Two great features of my Rain-table demand express notice, the paucity of rain at Cape Comorin and at Kurrachee, at the extremities of nearly the same meridional line, and the prodigious fall of rain at the elevation of 4500 feet at three stations differing greatly in latitude, but situated nearly in the same meridian. I have not any satisfactory explanation to offer of the want of rain either at Cape Comorin or at Kurrachee. I am not at all acquainted with the physical character of tile country about Cape Comorin, and cannot therefore express an opinion how far local circumstances occasion the phenomenon. I had thought that a very high mean temperature, with a limited range of the thermometer, might account for the want of rain at Kurrachee on the Indus, the vapour from the ocean not coming into an air cold enough to condense it; but the register of the thermometer for 1847 at Kurrachee shows that I could not found a satisfactory argument upon its records, for the maxima are not so great as at Calcutta, Madras and Bombay; the minima are lower, and the mean temperature is lower than at either of the places; some other cause therefore must be looked for than a high mean temperature. The clouds which constantly pass over Kurrachee, would appear not to be condensed until they impinge upon the Sulimanee Mountains, which run parallel to the right bank of the Indus. The explanation of the prodigious fall of rain at the level of 4500 feet is simple and satisfactory. The chief stratum of aqueous vapour brought from the equator by the S.W. monsoon is of a high temperature, and floats at a lower level than 4500 feet; indeed I have looked over, or upon the upper surface of the stratum at 2000 feet. It is dashed with considerable violence against the western mural faces of the Ghats, and is thrown ,up by these barriers in accumulated masses into a colder region than that in which it naturally floats; it is consequently rapidly condensed and rain falls in floods. The uncondensed vapour which escapes up the chasms and over the crest of the GhhtsI 366 LIEUT.-COLONEL SYKES'S DISCUSSION OF METEOROLOGICAL affords the precarious and scanty supply to the lands to the eastward, which the Tables show. Maximum Daily Rain-Fall. As might be looked for, the greatest fall of rain in any one day is met with in the records of those stations where there is the greatest annual fall, Mahabuleshwur and Uttray Mullay. At the former station the greatest fall in any one day in fifteen years was 13,06 inches on the 2nd of September 1833, but the months of June, July and August, have numerous instances of a daily fall of 11V32 inches, 12-76 inches, and 12 69 inches in those months respectively. The greatest monthly fall at Mahabuleshwur was 134-42 inches in July 1840. At Uttray Mullay the greatest daily fall in three years was 15,1 inches on the 14th of October 1845. On the 11th of December of the same year there was a fall in one day of 11-4 inches, and on the 9th of October 1844 the fall in one day was 9 0 inches. In 1846 there was not a daily fall approaching these figures. In Bombay, in 1845, the greatest daily fall was 4-71 inches on the 24th of July, and the next year, on the 16th of July, a daily fall occurred of 5-16 inches; but Dr. BUIST mentions that on the 1st of July 1844 there was a fall of rain in twenty-four hours of 7144 inches, two inches having fallen in seventy minutes; but this was on the first burst of the monsoon, which set in later than usual by three weeks. On the 10th of July, however, 9.43 inches fell, the greatest of the year. In the Deccan there is rarely a greater daily fall than two inches, but in the Sattarah records a maximum daily fall of 4 40 inches in four years is stated to have occurred in April; but this was in one of the squalls which are the precursors of the monsoon. Annexed is a comparison of the fall of rain in Bombay and at Mahabuleshwur for many years. OBSERVATIONS TAKEN IN INDIA. 367 Register of the Pluviometer at Bombay, from the year 1817 to 1849.

The S.W. wind begins to prevail at Madras over every other wind in the Month of April, and mostly remains the dominant wind until the end of September: the S.E. wind then prevails until October, about the middle of which month the approaching N.E. or rainv monsoon of the Coromandel coast almost displaces the S.E. wind. Its full development takes place in November, and it remains the prevailing wind until February, when the S.E. regains its influence, and is greatlv the dominant wind until April, when it is gradually displaced by the S.W. wind. The N.W. wind makes its appearance in every month of the year, chiefly in the months of the S.W. or Malabar monsoon, but least so in the months of March and April, in the years 1841 not in March, and 1842 not at all in April; the N.E. wind failed in the same months in the respective years. The N.W. is the quarter from whence Madras has the smallest amount of wind. The largely prevailing wind is the S.W., which, coming up from the equator, is the chief source of rain supply to India generally, but of which the Corornandel coast gets but a scanty proportion in consequence of the high western Ghats intercepting and condensing the chief part of the vapour brought by that wind. The next prevailing wind is the S.E., and this equally blows from the equator upon Madras and the Coromandel coast; but it is nevertheless not the rain-bearing wind of the Madras monsoon, which is from the N.E., sweeping over the bay of Bengal from Burmah. T~he S.W. wind from the Indian Ocean is a rain-bearing wind, but OBSERVATIONS TAKEN IN INDIA. 369 the S.E. wind, also from the Indian Ocean, is not a rain-bearing wind in the sense of a monsoon. By a comparison of the Wind-table with the Rain-table of Madras, it will be seen that in the months in which the S.E. winds prevail, February, March, April, September, and early part of October, the first three months are almost entirely rainless, and the little that falls in September is owing to occasional S.W. winds. This may be owing to the air over the peninsula in those months, from the position of the sun in the ecliptic being too hot to condense the S.E. vapour. On the contrary, the N.E. wind from the bay of Bengal comes loaded with vapour in November, De.cember and January, and the sun being far south, the peninsula is rapidly cooling, and the vapour from the bay of Bengal being of a higher temperature than the air upon which it is thrown, is condensed. The valuable table from the Madras Observatorv shlows by inspection, the gradual changes of the wind from one quarter to another, and the total annual numbers under each quarter show considerable uniforinity in successive years. Winds at Bombbay. The following Table of the winds at Bombay, for the year 1843, is from. the hourly observations taken by Dr. BUisT, LL.D. Although the numbers of hours at which the winds blew are placed under the points N.W., S.W., S.E., N.E., the numbers embrace the winds within each quarter of the compass; for instance, N.W. embraces all the winds blowing between N. and W., and so on for the other quarters.

The next prevailing wind is from the points between S. and W., having blown for 2289 hours, being the rain-bearing wind of the so-called S.W. monsoon, froui May to September inclusive; but in truth the wind most generally blows from the W.S.W., with a leaning to a point more westward, and a S.W. and by S. wind during the monsoon is of rare occurrence. The wind from the points between N. and E. is the next most prevalent. It begins to prevail in October, and continues prevalent as long as the N.E. monsoon blows at MDCCCL. 3 B 370 LIEUT.-COLONEL SYKES'S DISCUSSION OF METEOROLOGICAL Madras, on the opposite coast of India; it may be said to cease entirely when the Malabar monsoon approaches in May. The S.E. wind, unlike Madras, is little felt at Bombay, having blown at 383 hours only during 1843. Few as the occasions are on which it blew at Bombay, it would appear to have resulted from the veering of the N.E. wind through E. to a point southward of east; a wind strictly from the S. is scarcely known at Bombay. The N.W. wind, which is the dominant wind at Bombay and the least prevailing wind at Madras, blows at Bombay most in those months when it is least felt at Madras, namely, the first five months of the year, and in the months of March and April it almost disappears at Madras; but at Bombay in those months it blows at more hours than any other wind blows in any other two months of the year, excepting probably the W.S.W. in July and August. In January, February, March, April, and up to the third week in May, the wind from the N. to W. points blows from eleven to twenty-two hours daily, the remaining hours having the wind from the N. to E. points, constituting the land-wind, the N.W. being considered the sea-breeze. In part of October, November and December, the reverse is the case, the N.E. or land-wind prevailing from thirteen to nineteen hours daily, and the sea-breezes appearing between noon and 10 P.M. The suddenness with which the prevailing winds commence and terminate is a marked feature in the meteorology of Bombay. The wind from the S. to W. points begins suddenly the third or fourth week in May, and as suddenly terminates in the first or second week of October. The wind from. the N. to E. points takes the place of the S.W. wind and terminates suddenly in May. The N.W. wind, owing to its being a daily alternating wind with the land-breeze, from the heating action of the sun upon the land daily, has a more continuous character throughout the year, appearing even in the monsoon months, when a few days' sunshine heats the land; it is however much less frequent in those months than when the sun bears with continued force upon the land. Winds at Calcutta. With regard to the winds at Calcutta, Dr. J. M'CLELLAND, in the fifth volume of the Calcutta Journal of Natural History, has given a reduction of the meteorological register kept at the Surveyor-General's Office, Calcutta, from the 31st of October 1843 to the 31st of October 1844; from his paper the following extracts are made in a condensed form: OBSERVATIONS TAKEN IN INDIA. 371 Wind at noon. N.W. S.W. S.E. N.E. 1843. November ......... 26 1 0 3 December ......... 24 0 0 5 1844.

The winds of the S.W. monsoon would appear to commence in March in Calcutta, but not until May in Bomnbay. The tendency of the N.W. and S.W. winds in Calcutta, however, is rather to blow, the former from the N. and the latter from the S. than from intermediate points; out of 353 observations, the wind blew sixty-eight times from the N. and ninety-one times from the S., while the N.W. blew only thirtyfour times and the S.W. wind only forty-two times. Judging from the Table, Calcutta is little affected by the winds of the N.E. monsoon. There is only a single instance of "no wind" at noon during the whole twelve months.

In the months of January, November and December, Mahabuleshwtir would appear to share more largely in the easterly winds of Madras than in ti e N.W. winds of Bonmbay in those mouths; but in February, March, April and May, and the rest of the year the station would appear to have much the same winds as prevail at Bombay. Its elevated position, therefore, does not remove it from the periodic currents of air of (a lower level. Even Dodabetta, at its great elevation of 8640 feet, is partly subject to the periodic winds of Madras and Bombay, at least as far as one year's record of observations recorded hourly from OSLER's anemometer enables us to judge.

This is the more remarkable, as Dodabetta lies between Madras, where these winds are the prevailing winds of May, June, July, August and September, and Bombay, where the same winds prevail in the same months. It is probable, therefore, that Dodabetta is situated just above the upper surface of the stratum of wind and aqueous vapour which supplies the S.W. monsoon to Western India, and therefore has comparatively a small supply of rain from this source. But it is not situated (although on the western coast) above the stratum of wind and aqueous vapour which supplies the Coromandel coast during the N.E. monsoon, as it has the saite prevailing winds between the N. and E. points in the same months as at Madras from October to February, when the N.E. ceases at Madras, but continues at Dodabetta until late in May. The prevalence of winds from points between N. and W. in the months of July, August and September, is peculiar to Dodabetta: neither Mahabuleshwur, at 4500 feet, nor Madras, Bombay nor Calcutta has similar indications. However, as this so-denominated N.W. wind very frequently blows from only one or two points to the northward of west, the wind may belong to the monsoon of Western India, local physical circumstances having given it a slant. On the whole it may be said, that the peninsula of India, in its length and breadth and the atmosphere over it to the height of nearly 9000 feet, is subject to periodic winds; but at widely separated places, varying a point or two from the apparent normal winds, and comimencing or terminating a week or two earlier or later. May, June, July, August and September have prevailing winds from points between W. and S.; October, November, December, January and February have prevailing winds frnom points between N. and E.; February, March and April, at Madras, have a prevailing wind from points between S. and E., as opposed to Bombay, where the wind in those months prevails from points between N. and W., with rare instances of a S.E. wind; while at Calcutta the N.W. wind terminates in February; but a series for years of hourly observations, like those at Madras, are necessary to give that confidence which cannot be given to deductions from the meteorological data at present available from India. It is usually understood that very high winds materially depress the barometer, but the records at Dodabetta do not support this view. On the 17th and 18th of April 1847, the wind blew with a mean pressure of 21 lbs., and 14 lbs. respectively upon the square foot; but the barometer only fell fromn 21955 on the 16th to 21L917 on the 17th and rose to 21*984 on the 18th; and there was a maximum pressure from the wind on the 17th at one time of 35 lbs. 26th of May, maximum wind 28 5 lbs., baro-. meter not affected more than 0'010 inch; 12th of June 30 lbs. 26th of July 32 lbs., 10th of September 35 lbs., and 14th of October 22 lbs.; but these pressures of, the wind had little or no effect upon the barometer. 374 LIEUT.-COLONEL SYKES'S DISCUSSION OF METEOROLOGICAL Fogs. In the Madras observations there is not any mention made of fogs; and Captain LUDLOW of the Madras Engineers, who recorded the observations, tells me that fogs are almost unknown at Madras, the nearest approach to a fog being an occasional nist on the ground, not visible more than 3 feet above the surface.

They disappear after sunset, and are slightest from sunrise to nooil*. At Calcutta, from Dr. M'CLELLAND'S Report, there were only twenty instances in 1843-44, almost entirely at sunrise. At Mahabuleshwur, from the latter end of May until the middle of October, there is almost a continued fog with deluges of rain. At Dodabetta the prevalence of fogs is very remarkable, there being no less than 136 records of dense fogs and 53 of light fogs during the year. Of the dense fogs 52 occurred at gh 40m A.M. and 85 at 3h 40m P.M.; 27 light fogs at gh 40m A.M. and 25 at 3h 40m P.M. Electricity. I have not any data of a character to enable me to speak satisfactorily on the subject of the electric state of the air at tihe several stations. I conclude with a rapid analysis of the preceding Tables. In my paper published in the Philosophical Transactions in 1835 upon the Meteorology of the Deccan, I arrived at the following conclusions :-That HUMBOLDT was mistaken in supposing, upon the authority of HIORSBURGH, that the diurnal atmo* I presume Dr. BuTIsr means misty and comparatively semi-transparent heated air, as dis~tincet from Efogs OBSERVATIONS TAKEN IN INDIA. 375 spheric tides were suspended during the monsoon in Western India. The fact was also unquestionably established of the existence of four atmospheric tides within twenty-four hours,-two diurnal and two nocturnal, each consisting of a maximum and minimum tide, and the occurrence of these tides within the same limit hours as in America and Europe; the greatest mean diurnal oscillations taking place in the coldest months, and the smallest tides in the damp months of the monsoon in the Deccan, whilst at Madras the smallest oscillations were in the hottest months: it was shown also that these tides took place regularly without a single instance of interruption, whatever the thermometric or hygrometric indications might be, or whatever the state of the weather, even storms and hurricanes only modifying and not interrupting them. The anomalous fact was also shown of the mean diurnal oscillations being greater at Poona, at an elevation of 1823 feet, than at the level of the sea, in a lower latitude at Madras or Bombay, while at an elevation greater than Poona, the mean diurnal oscillations were less than at Poona. It was shown also that the seasons did not affect the limit hours of the tides,; but it was shown at the same time that the turning-points of the tides were sometimes irregular; that a tide flowed for a longer or shorter period, and that there were numerous cases of a stationary state of the atmosphere at the hours when the tides should turn. It was shown that the maximum mean pressure of the atmosphere was greatest in December or January, gradually diminished to June, July or August, and subsequently increased to the coldest months. The trifling daily and annual range of the barometer, compared with the ranges in extra-tropical climates, was shown; also the more limited annual range of the thermometer in the Deccan than in Europe, but the existence of a greater daily range; the maximum mean temperature was in April or May, and then gradually declined to the coldest months; very considerable differences in the dewingpoints within very narrow areas were shown; dew being frequently local and occurring under anomalous circumstances, and the great contrast between tile dewingpoints, on the sea-coast at Bombay and in the Deccan, was pointed out; the rain in the Deccan was not more than 28 per cent. of the quantity that fell in Bombay; the winds principally westerly and easterly, rarely from due north or south; and finally, the rarity of fogs was stated. It is very satisfactory to find in the discussion of the meteorological observations in the present paper, from a very extended area, from different heights and fi-orn observations, some of which are hourly, and which run through several years at the same station, that after an interval of twenty years the accuracy of the former deductions should be established almost to the letter; but as some of the observations now discussed were from hourly records, continued through considerable periods of time, an opportunity has been afforded of investigating abnormal conditions, which the former limited number of diurnal observations did not permit; and from these sources a rapid review of what appear to be normal and abnormal conditions is now appended.1st. Thbe annual and daily range of the barometer diminishes from the sea-level up to 376 LIEUT.-COLONEL SYKES'S DISCUSSION OF METEOROLOGICAL the greatest height observed, 8640 feet at Dodabetta, from a mean annual and mean daily range at Madras of 0735 and 0,122 to 0410 and 0060 at Dodabetta;-the annual range would appear to increase, about and beyond the northern tropic, as the annual range at Calcutta (not by hourly observations) is 0-911: but the diurnal range is somewhat less (01 15) than at Madras. At no one of the places of observation, even taking the maximum pressure of one year with the minimum pressure of another year, does there appear to have been a range of pressure equivalent to an inch of mercury; nevertheless in the Cyclones, or rotatory storms, there occnrs at times a range of pressure of nearly 2 inches of mercury within forty-eight hours; but it is sshown from a comparison of the simultaneous records on board ship, where these great depressions were noted, with the records at the observatories on shore, that the great depressions occurred within very limited areas. I had formerly shown that the times or turning-points of ebb and flow (if the terms be permitted) of the aerial ocean were occasionally retarded or accelerated, although the means fixed the turning,-points within certain limit hours; but I was not aware that in the ebb or flow of the four daily tides, they ever retrograded or halted in their onward or retiring course. The hourly observations now satisfy us that abnormal conditions are of no infrequent occurerence,-that the tides at times flow or ebb for four, five, six or even seven and eight hours*,-that frequent instances occur of retrograde movements for short periods of time, as if the tide had met with a check tnd been turned back; and at the turning-points there are numerous instances of the atmosphere being stationary for a couple of hours. The maximumn pressure of the atmosphere is in the coldest months, December or January, but the minimum pressure is not in the hottest months, but in June or July. The barometric readings, when protracted t, show a gradual curve from December or January descending to June or July, and then ascending again to December or January, there being an occasional interruption in October or November; and as the curves at Madras, Bombay and Calcutta correspond, and as Madras has NO S.W. monsoon, while Bombay has a S.W. monsoon, and as Bombay is destitute of the N.E. monsoon of Madras, it would appear that the general movements of the mass of the atmosphere are little influenced by any conditions of its lower strata; but the curve of pressure would seem to have some relation to the sun's place in the ecliptic. The normal conditions of daily temperature are, that it is coldest in India at sunrise, and hottest between the hours of 1 and 3 P.M..; but the preceding tables show many aberrations fromw this rule. The regular increment or decrement of mean monthly heat from the maximun or minim um period is somewhat remarkable, as the curve is independent of the S.W. monsoon at Bombay and the N.E. monsoon at Ma* One instance at Aden of nine hours! t To that very able and zealous meteorologist. Dr. BUIST, LL.D. of Bombay, I am indebted for the protracted curves of pressure of the barometer appended to this paper. Plates XVII. XVIII. XIX. XX. OBSERVATIONS TAKEN IN INDIA. 377 dras; and the passage of the sun twice over both places does not derange the curve. The anomalies of the annual mean temperatures of Madras, Bombay, Calcutta and Aden, not diminishing with the increase in the latitude of the respective places, are pointed out, and numerous instances are given of the very great power of the slanting rays of the sun beyond the tropic. As is the case with the barometric, so do the heat tables indicate that the annual and daily ranges of the thermometer diminish with the elevation of the place of observation above the sea-level, the elevated tableland of the Deccan however being an exception to this rule. At Mahabuleshwur, at 4500 feet, the temperature of the air was never below 450 with a maximum and minimum thermometer; and at Dodabetta the temperature of the air was never below 38? 5; never theless at both places ice and hoar-frost w ere frequently found on the ground at sunrise, resulting from the separate or conjoined effects of radiation and evaporation. I Lave already stated that I do not attach much value to the readings of the wet bulb, owing to the vaiioi s sources of error in the, instrument itself, and to the manifest sources of error in the existing theoretical formulae for giving a numerical value to its readings to fix the tension of vapour in the atmosphere for the determination of the dew-point. No doubt the dew-points obtained by means of the wet bull) have a certain relation to the truth; and in some favourably concurring conditions may be as proximate to the truth as dew-points would be, obtained by direct means, but the elaborate experiments of REGNAULT show that in a calm in the open air or in a chamber, the wet bulb surrounds itself with its own humid atmosphere, and with a breeze blowing upon it the temperature of the wet bulb falls or alternates as the wind blows more or less rapidly upon it. Moreover, Professor ORLEBAR points out a source of error to which no doubt all the observations in India were mole or less subject, namely, the proximity of the dry bulb to the wet bulb, and the cold from the latter in consequence depressing the temperature of the dry bulb, two, three, or more degrees below the temperature of the air, necessarily producing fallacious results. Making allowance for the defects of DANIELes hygrometer, the dew-points obtained by its means are infinitely more worthy of confidence than those obtained by means of the wet bulb. On the whole, I would not venture to say more with respect to normal conditions of moisture in India, than that the air of the sea-coast has always a much greater fraction of saturation than the lands of the interior and that the elevated plateau of the Deccan is periodically subject to very great degrees of dryness. The rain-tables are so extensive that it will only be necessary to point out some unexpected phenomena connected with the distribution of rain, It is found both on the sea-coasts and on the table-lands of the Deccan, that within very limited areas, the differences in the fall of rain may be very great. With nine rain-gauges employed in the small island of Bombay in the months of June and July, in the monsoon of 1849, the quantity collected in the different gauges ranged in July from 46 inches to 102 incthes, and in June fromx 19 inches to 46 inches. At Sattarah, with three rainMDcccL. 3 C 37 8 DISCUSSION OF METEOROLOGICAL OBSERVATIONS IN INDIA. gauges within the distance of a mile, they differed in their contents several inches from each other; and at Mahabuleshwur and Paunchgunny, nearly on the saine level, the latter place being only eleven miles to the eastward of the fortner, the difference in the annual fall of rain was respectively 254 inches and 50 inches The normal conditions are, that there is a much greater fall of rain on the sea-coasts than on the table-lands of the Deccan, but that the Ghhts intervening between the coasts and the table-lands have three times the amount of the fhll on the coasts, and fromn ten to fifteen times the amount of the fall on the table-lands of the interior; the paucity of the fall of rain at Cape Comorin and in the mouths of the Indus would also appear to be normal conditions. The Tables must be referred to for the winds; the normal states are those of the Sa.. and N.E. monsoons, and the influence of the latter is periodically felt at the height of 8640 feet, which height would appear just at the upper surface of the stratum of air constituting the S.W. monsoon; but hourly observations for lengthened periods of time are necessary from IDodabetta, to determine what really are the periodical winds at that height. From the points other than those between S. and W., and N. and E., there is also at the several stations a certain amount of periodicity in the winds; the winds that are common to different stations having only a slant more or less at the different stations; for instance, the S.W. and N.W. winds of Bombay blowing in the summer months in Calcutta incline rather to be S. and N. winds, than S.W. tand N.W. winds; but to be enabled to speak with any precision upon this branch of the meteorology of India, and indeed upon most other branches with a comprehensive and philosophlical object, hourly observations are necessary,-simultaneously taken with previously compared instruments by zealous observers; and having the records in a form commion to all the observers, so as to admit of rigid comparisons :-when this is done, not only in India but in Europe, meteorologists will be in a better condition to generalize and propound normal conditions, than the state of our knowledge at present would justify, for it must be borne in mni-nd that "Error latet in generalibus."
