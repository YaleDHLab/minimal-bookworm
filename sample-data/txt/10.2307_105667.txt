Apparent time. h ~ ~ A Discernible penumbra on the north14 8 0 east part of the Moon's limb. The beginning of the eclipse, by my bare eye; but doubtful to about a minute, 14 20 from the dilute and uncertain termination of the true shadow. The following phases were observed with a refracting telescope, of Dollond's construction, about 4 feet long, and much more exactly than the beginning. 24 12 Shadow touches Grimaldi. 26 45 Grimaldi all in the shadow. 33 30 Shadow touches Plato. 34 32 touches Copernicus. 43 33 touches Mare serenitatis.
