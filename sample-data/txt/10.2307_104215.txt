III. An Account of the Transit of Mercury over the Sun, Oct. 25. 1743. in the Morning, observed at Mr. Geo. Graham's House in Fleetstreet. T H E Beginning could not be seen by reason of Clouds, but about 8h, 45~, Mercury was seen (through a reflecting Telescope Three Foot Focus, magnifying about 50 times) about Four or Five of his Diameters within the Sun's Limb. Read Nov. 3. 1743. At Mr. Short's House in Surrey-street, Mercury was seen just past the interior Contact 8h, 30~, 59~, through [579] through a reflecting Telescope Two Foot Focus, magnifying about 70 times; the Person who observed it says, that the Thread of Light between Mercury and the Sun's Limb was so small, as scarcely to amount to the 20th or 30th Part of Mercury's Diameter. The following Differences of Right Ascension between the Sun's preceding Limb and Mercury, were taken at Mr. Short's House. Sun's preceding Limb touched the h. ~. ~. Wire at....... 10. 58. 55. Mercury touched the same Wire at 10. 59. 40. Sun's preceding Limb touched the Wire at....... 11. 48. 4. Mercury touched the same Wire at. 11. 48. 32. Sun's subsequent Limb touched the same Wire at...... 11. 50. 20. Sun's preceding Limb touched the Wire at....... 11. 49. 20. Mercury touched the same Wire at 11. 49. 46. Sun's preceding Limb touched the Wire at....... 11. 51. 9. Mercury touched the same Wire at 11. 51. 36. Sun's preceding Limb touched the Wire at....... 12. 1. 33. Mercury touched the same Wire at 12. 1. 57. Mr. Graham got an Observation made by a Person in his Neighbourhood, by which it appears, that at [580] at 11h, 59~, 50~, Mercury preceded the Sun's Centre 42~ in Right Ascension. The Sky clearing up towards One o'Clock, the following Times were observed at Mr. Graham's House with great Accuracy. h. ~. ~. Last interior Contact at.... 1. 0. 42. End, or Mercury just leaving the 1. 2. 16. Sun's Limb at..... This last Observation agrees to a Second with the same Observation made by Dr. Bevis at Mr. Sisson's House in the Strand. During the time of these Observations it blew a violent Gale of Wind, so that both Observers and Instruments were somewhat disturbed. IV.
