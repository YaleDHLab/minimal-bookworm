Abstract of a Letter from Mr. Pennant to Rich. Holford Esq; Master in Chancery, of an Earthquake felt in Flintshire, on April 2. 1750. Downing, near Holywell in Flintshire, April 3. 1750. LAST Night we were greatly alarm'd with a violent Shock of an Earthquake between 10 and 11 o' Clock. I, who was in Bed, was frequently moved up and down; and the Bed, having Casters, was removed some small Space from its proper Situation. Read May 10. 1749. During the Shock, a great Noise was heard in the Air; and, some Nights before, Lights were seen in the Sky; such as were previous to the Earthquake in Town. Thanks to Providence, no further Mischief has happen'd, than the Terror this unusual Phaenome non occasion'd in our Family. This Place is about two Miles from the Sea. XXXIX.
