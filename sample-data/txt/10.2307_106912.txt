LETTER Io RliVEREND SIR, Norwich, 17th April, x794. I RECEIVED your letter yesterday X and I aln extremely happy i;n giving you the best description in lny ponver respecting t}<e plaxnornenon I saw in the moon, on Friday the 7th of Marcll, a few minutes before eight o'clock in the evening. I was in laopes, as it was a brlght evening, that some astronomer might observe it, who would have described it in a more sczentic luanner than I can. The few observations I made were merely to comparewith some account I expected and wished to meet ill some periodical publication. My friend Mr. ECKWITH having the day before told me that I might see Mercury soon after suz-set, I had beell looliing for that planet from the Castle-hill in Norwich but was disappoitlted by a clouded llorizon. I lnention tllis merely as the reasotl of tny being Ied to a more particular notice of the moon also in this evening, havilzg lost the first object of tlaat evening's attentioneC 429-3 Mr. WILKINS S Account of a Light43oWhen I saw the light speck, as shewn in the sketch, (see Tab. XXI. fig. .3 I was very much surprised; for, at the instant of discovery I believed a star was passing over tlae moon, which on the next moment's consideration I knew to be impossible. I remelubered having seen, at some periods of the moon, detached ligllts from the serrated edge of light, through a telescope; but this spot was considerably too far distant froln the elllightened part of the moon; besides, this was seen witll the naked eye. I was, asit were, rivetted to the spot svhere I stood, during the tilue it continued, and took every method I could imagine to convince myself that it vas not an error of sight; and two persons, strangers, passed me at the sallle timef wllom I requested to look7 and they (may be, a little more igtlorant tllan xnyself) said it was a star. I anz confident I saw it five lninutes at least btlt as the time is only conjecttlral it might not, possibly, be so lotlgv The spot appeared rather; brighter. than arly other enlighterzed part of the moon. IT WAS THERE WHEN I FIRST LOOKED. The whole time I saw it, it was a FIXED, STEADY LIGHT, except the moment before it disappeared, svlaen its bRightneSS INCREASED, but that appearance was instantaneous. I have a reflecting telescope, and as I was very near homeS I had determined to return and use it on this occasiolz; for it svas so fixedS I had scarcely a doubt but its appearallce wou]d contitlue; but altnost at the installt7 alld whilst I was looking it totally disappeared. You can tell, by the age of tTle rnoon at that -timeS the apparent breadth of light upon the surface of that body, which, as near as I can judge, determines the distance of the spot from two points, B and 7 on the peripllery of the circle, (see fig. 1 ) in which A is the enlightened spot; B A A D . D C v B A D is supposed a right angle. seeÂ¢ tn the dark Part of the Moon.431I mentioned this soon afterulards to a gentleman of my acquaintance, who sometimes amuses himself in the stu(ly of astronomy; he was extremely itlquisitive about it, and conjectured this phaenomenon to be some great volcanic convulsiorl irl the moon, which induced me at that time to assist lny memory with a sketch like what I have here sent you. I shall be obliged to yoll, Sir, if you will favour lne with Dr. MASKELYNE'S oplnion, if what I have related is sufficient ground for him to form an opinion upon S and whetller any such phnomenon has ever before been observed. When I was lately in town, I mentioned the particulars to my sntorthy frielld Mr. H. REPTON and if my engagernents would have permitted, he was desirous I should call with him upon Dr. HERSCHEL, with whom he has some acquaintance. I ams &c. Norwich, WIIjLIAM WILKINS. s7th April, 1794. To the Rev. SAMUEL VI v CE. LETTER II. REV:EREND SIR, Norwich, 2d May, 1 794. I azzl favoured with yottr letter of the lst instantn respecting the description of the light spot observed by m-e ita the moon. I aln certain as to the evening I saw the pllnomenon, because I made thememorandum in a pocket journal I keep, besides, another local -circumstance convinces me of its being on a Friday, and rlot otl any other day than the 7th of March. You are undoubtedly right in supposing I had forgot how near the moon was to a half moon; and when I wrote to Mr. VINCE, I answered him irl haste S for his letter to me requested Mr. WILKrNS'S Account of a Light432an immediate answer, otl account of his engagement to leave Cambridge in a short time. If you will please to refer to my letter, I think you will find I was somehow aware of my not describing the age of tlle moon properly in the sketcll; for I said, " you will be able to tell by the age of tlle moon at that c; time, tZpe apparent breadtb of light, nvhich may, in some mea s; suren cletermine the situation of the spot according to lny '4 idea.' The sketcll I made at first was in pencil without tlle as sistance of compasses. It appeared like a small star, without chalzging its form or situation; and its distance was as far from the enlightened edge D as from the dark edge B. I am, &c. WILI,IAM WILKINS. To the Rev. Dr. MASKELYNS LETTER III. REVEREND SIR, Norlxlich, 8tll May, 1794. I am again favou-red with yours of the 6th instant. The evenirzg I saw the bright spot on the moon, I had been looiing for Mercury soon after sun-set, and walked more than an thour X and having been disappointed by a clouded horizon, I returned home (my house is within $o yards of the Castle hill) ; and after staying some time, set out again to the coffieehouse to look at the papers, as I usually do about-that time, i. ee eigllt o'clock. I took the Castle-hill again in my wayn when I was surprised with the appearance I have already describede After the disappearance of the 13hxnomenon, I was very seen tn the dark Part of the lMoon.433particular ill my inquiries respecting the time, and called purposely on a neighbour to astertain it with certainty; anct found it a few minutes before eight o'clock, which time I entered in my pocket journal fl and on inquiry of Mrs. WILKIN-S, she says I left home at that time. I am in my +4th year, and have a strong, good sight, not ia t}ze least short sighted. About two years sitlce, I purchased a pair of spectacles in town, because I did not, irl pointing a pen, see the nib so distinctly as formerly; but notwithstanding,, they lay in my drawer totally useless. My^profession has lately carried me frequently to Orfordness, where I have been corlstructitlg a lighthouse for Lord HOWARD, upon the new principle, with ARGAND lamps and reflectors; and the goodness of na sight has often been remarked, irs discovering vessels with the nakecY eye, which my comanions could not discover but svith the telescope. I find tlaat by looking some tzme at an object, nzy left eye waters, I suppose from weakness, but if I shut it, nzy other eye still remains strong sighted. Whetl the moon is young, I do perfectly see the svllole circumference, from the faint light wllich surrounds it, and orl that evening the moon appeared a well defiIled cresceolt. I remember seeing the star you mention that evening; but I think it was betnveen nitle and tell o'clock that I observed it e and it--was in appearalleeS may be, two of the moon's diameters distance to the vvest e but I did not particularly notice it. I am very certaill ofthis spot appearing W1THIN the circumferellce of the moon S cirele. I am, &c. \VILI>IAM WILKINS. Custl M-a;dow. To the Rev. Dr. M A S K E 1, Y N , * W1r.
