[272] XV. A Journal of the Weather at Montreal. By Mr. Barr, Purveyor to his Majesty's Hospitals in Canada; communicated by Dr. Saunders. Read January 20, 1780. T H E winter seemed to set in about the middle of November; from that time to the end of the month we had some snow and cold weather; but the thermometer never was lower than 16~ or 18~ below the freezing point. About the 24th and 25th of December people crossed the river three miles below Montreal. The letters a and b after the figures denote the mercury to be above or below 0. The thermometer from which these observations were taken, was of F A H R E NH E I T'S construction; it was suspended to a post, perfectly in the shade, and no building nearer to it to reflect the heat than five or six feet. 1778 Mr. B A R R'S Journal of the Weather, &C. 273 F O R D E C E M B E R, 1778 Day.

It is worth observing, that the great quantity of snow on the ground has, from the 29th of March to the 4th of April, been chiefly melted away by the heat of the sun, for the rain during that period has been very inconsiderable. No refoulement of the river this spring; the ice gave way in the middle of the river first, and the opening has been growing larger and larger every day since the 28th of March, and is this day, the 4th of April, very large, although the ice remains fast on the border of the river.
