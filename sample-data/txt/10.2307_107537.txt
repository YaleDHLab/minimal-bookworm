XXIV. A new demonstration of the binomial theorem. By Thomas Knight, Esq. Communicated by W. H. Wollaston, M. D. Sec. R. S. Read July 4, i816. IT is somewhat remarkable that, amongst the various and farfetched methods and artifices by which the binomial theorem has been obtained, no one should once hlave thought of the only course which seems obvious and natural. The equation (a+ x)m x (a +y) {(a + x) (a +y)} expresses the general property of powers, whether m be positive or negative, whole or fractional ; and from this equation, without the help of any artifice, the series in question is deduced. Some investigations have been found fault with, as drawn from principles allied to the method of fluxions; whilst, on the other hand, a demonstration, taken from the is Thieorie des Fonctions," has been represented as perfect: but I cannot help thinking that it is as much connected with the fluxional calculus as any of the rest; for it seems to make no difference whether, in (a + x)m, we substitute x + u for x, and take the coefficient of u, or substitute x + a, and take the coefficient of I&. The former substitution was made because it was known to be equivalent to the other, and has so little apparient connection with the subject, that a student would hardly understand why it was made. The demonlstration of Mr. LA CROIx in the Introduction to his", Calcul DftiSrentied'/ is MDCCCXVI. X 32 Mr. KNIGHT'S new detnonstration of liable of course to the same objection. If we multiply a+x, continually, first by itself, and thlien by the ppovers successively arising, we easily see that the second term of each succeeding product is of the form naez'x, n beingr the exponent of the power: this does not require a more formal proof, and I assume it in what followsv. Nor is it more difficult to perceive ti at, generally, m being positive or negatve, vhole or fractional, tihe following form may be assumed, (a + X)m atn + fAam-xx +"Aa' + 1I'Aam3x 3 + where 'A, "A, "'A, &c. are expressions depending on in alone, consequently, (a y) =am+AamZ y+11Aam-!y2+"Aam-3y3+ a ndbecause {(a+x)(a+y)} I=(a2+ax+ay+xy)"= =am(a+x+y+2I) )a (a +x + ry)tm, by making (r i + ) we have also {(a+x) (a+y)} "atma0t+Aam-1(x+ry)+ "Aam--z(x+?YY)2+ `'Aa-13(x+7y)3+ } or neglecting all the powers of y but the first, -am {atm + IAam x + 1/Aam-zx+ "1Aam-3x3+ } amyt IAam Y 9 IAamz vx+ 3 ,IAam-3 + + 0 0 * 0 a 0 r 0 * * 1* Having thus the forms of the series, nothing is required but to substitute them in the equation (a+x)x (a y)m= {(a+z-) (a+y)} and to compare the coefficients of the first power of y on each side, and we find IAazm-1 + 'A Aaz2m-zx + /A"1Aa m-3X2 + IA1/fAa2m-4x3+ v + 2IIAa~ VZ + 3 "'Aa m3,Xr?+ 4""Aazm4X3+ the binomial :theorem. =,Aazm-I +2'IAa2mz 1z + 3IlAazm -3 +4t"Aazm-+ + JAa2m-? +"Aazm3 + 3 ",Aazz J + by putting for V its value i + a.
