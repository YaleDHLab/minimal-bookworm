[152] An Extract of two Essays in Political Arithmetick concerning the comparative Magnitudes, &c. of London and Paris by Sr. William Petty Knight. R. S. S. The excellent Author of these two Essays, has in several former of the same Nature made it appear that Mathematical Reasoning, is not only applicable to Lines and Numbers, but affords the best means of Judging in all the concerns of humane Life.

The whole is so close writt, that it will not bare Epitomizing, wherefore I rather recommend it to the Curious who cannot but be satisfied therewith. An
