[902] XLII. A Method of extending Cardan's Rule for resolving one Case of a Cubick Equation of this Form, x3 * qx = r, to the other Case of the same Equation, which it is not naturally fitted to solve, and which is therefore often called the irreducible Case. By Francis Maseres, Esq. F. R. S. Cursitor Baron of the Exchequer. Read July 9, 1778. A R T I C L E I. IT is well known to all persons conversant with algebra, that CARDAN'S rule for resolving the cubick equation x3-qx=r is only sitted to resolve it when rr/4 is equal to, or greater than, q3/27, or when r is equal to, or greater than, 2q ~ q/3 ~ 3, and that it is of no use in the resolution of the other case of this equation, in which r is of any magnitude less than 2q ~ q/3 ~ 3. For in this case rr/4 q3/27 becomes (according to the usual language of algebraists) a negative quantity, and consequently its square-root be1 comes Extension of Cardan's Rule, &c. 903 comes impossible, and the expression given by CARDAN'S rule for the value of x (which is either ~3~r/2 + ~~rr/4 q3 27 + q/3~3~r/2 + ~~rr/4 q3/27 or ~3~r/2 + ~~rr/4 q3/27 + ~3~r/2 ~~rr/4 q3/27), involves in it the impossible quantity ~rr/4 q3/27, and therefore is unintelligible and useless: or, according to what appears to me a more correct way of speaking (who never could form any idea of a negative quantity, and never understand by the sign any thing more than the subtraction of a lesser quantity from a greater), the quantity rr/4 q3/27 becomes itself impossible, or the supposition that rr/4 is greater than q3/27, (which is one of the foundations of CARDAN'S rule), is no longer true, and consequently the rule itself, which is built upon it, can no longer take place. 2. Nevertheless it is possible, by the help of Sir ISAAC NEWTON'S binomial theorem, to extend this rule to this latter case, in which rr/4 is less than q3/27, and which it is not of itself fitted to resolve; or, to speak with more accuracy, it is possible to derive from the expression of the value of x given by CARDAN'S rule for the resolution of the equation x3 qx = r in the first case, in which rr/4 is greater 904 Extension of Cardan's Rule to the greater than q3/27, another expression somewhat different from the former, that shall exhibit the true value of x in the second case, in which rr/4 is less than q3/27, provided it be not less than q3/2 X 27, or q3/54: and this without any mention of either impossible, or negative, quantities. To shew how this may be effected, is the design of the following pages. 3. That the whole of this matter may be seen at one view, it will be convenient to set forth the foundation and investigation of CARDAN'S rule for resolving the equation x3-qx=r, when rr/4 is greater than q3/27; which may be done as follows. The Investigation of Cardan's Rule for resolving the Cubick Equation x3* qx=r, when rr/4 is greater than q3/27. 4. Previously to the investigation of this rule, it will be proper to make the following observations. OBS. 1. In the equation x3-qx=r (which is a proposition affirming that x3 is greater than qx, and that the excess is equal to r) xx must always be greater than q, and x than ~ q. OBS. Second Case of the Cubick Equation x3-qx=r. 905 OBS. 2. While x increases from ~ q ad infinitum, x3 will increase continually from q~ q ad infinitum, and qx will increase continually from the same quantity q~ q ad infinitum. OBS. 3. Also, while x increases from ~ q ad infinitum, the excess of x3 above qx will increase continually from nothing ad infinitum, without ever decreasing. For, if we put x to denote the increment which x receives in any given time, either small or great, qx will be the increment which qx will receive in the same time, and 3x2x + 3xx2 + x2 will be the increment of x3 in the same time. Now, since xx is always greater than q during the whole increase of x from being equal to ~ q ad infinitum, xx X x will be greater than qx during that whole increase. Therefore, a fortiori, 3x2x + 3xx2 + x3 (which is more than triple of xx X x) will be greater than qx; that is, the increment of x3 will be greater than the contemporary increment of qx during all the increase of x. Consequently the excess of x3 above qx, or the compound quantity x3-qx, will continually increase, without ever decreasing, while x increases from ~ q to any greater magnitude. OBS. 4. Since the compound quantity x3-qx increases continually at the same time as x increases; and, when V O L. LXVIII. 5 U x is 906 Extension of Cardan's Rule to the x is equal to 2~q/~3, x3-qx (= 8q~q/3~3 2q~q/~3 = 8q~q/3~3 6q~q/3~3) = 2q~q/3~3, it follows that, if x is greater than 2~q/~3, the compound quantity x3-qx will be greater than 2q~q/3~3, and, if x is less than 2~q/~3, the said compound quantity will be less than 2q~q/3~3; and, e converso, if the compound quantity x3-qx, or, its equal, the absolute term r, is greater than 2q~q/3~3, the value of x will be greater than 2~q/~3; and, if x3 qx, or r, is less than 2q~q/3~3, the value of x will be less than 2~q/~3; or, if rr/4 is greater than q3/27, x will be greater than 2~q/~3, and, if rr/4 is less than q3/27, x will be less than 2~q/~3. OBS. 5. When r is greater than 2q~q/3~3, or rr/4 is greater than q3/27, and consequently (by the last observation) x is greater than 2~q/~3, xx will be greater than 4q/3, and xx/4 will be greater than q/3. But xx/4 is the square of x/2. Therefore when r is greater than 2q~4/3~3, or rr/4 is greater than 3/27, the square of half x will be greater than q/3. But (by EUCLID'S Elements, Book II. Prop. V.) it is always possible to divide a line, as x, into two unequal parts in such a proSecond Case of the Cubick Equation x3-qx=r. 907 a proportion that the rectangle under its parts shall be equal to any quantity that is less than the square of its half. Therefore, when r is greater than 2q~q/3~3, or rr/4 is greater than q3/27, it is possible to divide the line, or root, x into two unequal parts of such magnitudes that their rectangle, or product, shall be equal to q/3. This observation is the foundation of CARDAN'S rule for the resolution of the equation x3-qx=r in the first case of that equation, or when r is greater than 2q~q/3~3, or rr/4 is greater than q3/27; the investigation of which is as follows. P R O B L E M. 5. To resolve the Equation x3 * qx=r, when r is greater than 2q~q/3~3, or rr/4 is greater than q3/27. S O L U T I O N. Since r is supposed to be greater than 2q~q/3~3, and consequently (by Obs. 5.) xx/4 is greater than q/3, it is possible for x to be divided into two unequal parts of such magnitudes that their rectangle, or product, shall be equal to q/3. Let it be conceived to be so divided; and let the 5 U 2 greater 908 Extension of Cardan's Rule to the greater of the two parts be called a, and the lesser b. Then will ab be = q/3, and consequently 3ab will be = q, and 3ab x a + b will be = q x a + b. Now, since a + b is equal to x, we shall have a3 + 3aab + 3abb + b3 = x3, and q x a + b = qx. Therefore x3 qx will be = a3 + 3aab + 3abb + b3 q x a + b = a3 + 3ab x a + b + b3 q x a + b; that is (because 3ab x a + b is = q x a + b) x3qx will be = a3 + b3. Therefore r (which is = x3 qx) will be = a3 + b3. But, since 3ab is = q, we shall have b = q/3a, and b3 = q3/27a3. Therefore a3 + b3 is = a3 + q3/27a3, and r (which is=a3 + b3) is = a3 + q3/27a3. Therefore ra3 is = a6 + q3/27, and ra3 a6 is = q3/27. But ra3 a6 is the product of the multiplication of r a3 into a3, which are together equal to r. Therefore (by El. II. 5.) ra3 a6 must be less than the square of half r, that is, than rr/4, and consequently may be subtracted from it. Let it, and its equal q3/27, be so subtracted. And we shall have rr/4 ra3 + a6 = rr/4 q3/27. Therefore the squareroot of rr/4 ra3 + a6 will be equal to ~ rr/4 q3/27. But the square-root of rr/4 ra3 + a6 is the difference of r/2 and a3, that Second Case of the Cubick Equation x3 qx=r. 909 that is, either r/2 a3 or a3 r/2, according as r/2 or a3 is the greater quantity. But it has appeared above that a3 and b3 together are equal to r; and a is supposed to be greater than b, and consequently a3 is greater than b3. Therefore a3 must be greater, and b3 less, than r/2. Therefore a3 r/2 is the difference of a3 and r/2, and consequently is the square-root of the quantity rr/4 ra3 + a6. Therefore a3 r/2 is = ~ rr/4 q3/27, and a3 is = r/2 + ~ rr/4 q3/27. Consequently a is = ~3 r/2 + ~ rr/4 q3/27. But b has been shewn to be=q/3a. Therefore b is= q/3~3 r/2 + ~ rr/4 q3/27; and consequently a + b, or x, is = ~3 r/2 + ~ rr/4 q3/27 + q/3~3 r/2 + ~ rr/4 q3/27. Q. E. I. 6. This expression may be rendered more simple by substituting the single letter s in it instead of ~ rr/4 q3/27. For then it will be ~3 r/2 + S + q/3~3 r/2 + S. Synthetick Demonstration of the Truth of the foregoing Solution. 7. That this expression is equal to x in the equation ~ x3910 Extension of Cardan's Rule to the x3-qx = r will appear by substituting it instead of x in the compound quantity x3-qx, which will thereby be seen to be equal to r, as it ought to be. This may be done in the manner following. Since x is = ~3 ~r/2 + S + q/3~3 ~r/2 + S, or ~r/2 + S 1/3 + q/3 x ~r/2 + S 1/3, we shall have x3 = r/2 + S + 3 X ~r/2 + S 2/3 x q/3 x ~r/2 + S 1/3 + 3 x ~r/2 + S 1/3 x qq/9 x ~r/2 + S 2/3 + q3/27 x ~r/2 + S = r/2 + S + q x ~r/2 + S 1/3 + qq/3 x ~r/2 + S 1/3 + q3/27r/2 + 27S; and qx = qx ~r/2 + S 1/3 + qq/3 x ~r/2 + S 1/3; and consequently x3 qx = r/2 + S + q3/27r/2 + 27S = r/2 + S + q3/27r/2 + 54s/2 = r/2 + S + q3/27r + 54s/2 = r/2 + S + 2q3/27r + 54s. Now ss, or rr/4 q3/27, is 27rr 4q3/108 = 27rr 4q3/36 x 3; or, if we put mm = 27rr 4q3, we shall have ss, or rr/4 q3/27, = mm/36 x 3, and S = m/6 ~3. Therefore 2q3/27r + 54s is = 2q3/27r + 54 x m/6 ~3 = 2q3/6 x 27 x ~3 x r + 54m/6 ~3 = 12 ~3 x q3/6 x 27 ~3 x r + 54m=2 ~3 x q3/27 ~3 x r + 9m. Therefore S + 2q3/27r + 54s is=m/6~3 + 2 ~3 x q3/27 ~3 x r + 9m = 27 ~3 x rm + 9mm + 36q3/6 x 27 x 3r + 6 x 9 x ~3 x m = 3 ~3 x rm + mm + 4q3/54r + 6 ~3 x m = 3 ~3 x rm + 27rr 4q3 + 4q3/54r + 6 ~3 x m = 3 ~3 x rm + 27rr/54r + 6 ~3 x m = ~3 x rm + 9rr/18r + 2 ~3 x m; and r/2 + S + Second Case of the Cubick Equation x3 qx = r. 911 S + 2q3/27r + 54s is = r/2 + ~3 x rm + 9rr/18r + 2 ~3 x m = 18rr + 2 ~3 x rm + 2 ~3 x rm + 18rr/36r + 4~3 x m = 36rr + 4 ~3 x rm/36r + 4~3 x m = r. But we have before shewn that x3 q3 is = r/2 + S + 2q3/27r + 54s. Therefore x3 qx is = r, and consequently ~3 ~r/2 + S + q/3~3 ~r/2 + S is the true value of x in the cubick equation x3 qx = r. Q. E. D. Two other Expressions for the Root of the foregoing Equation. 8. Two other expressions may be found for the root of this equation by resuming the investigation contained in Art. 5. The first of these expressions is ~3 ~r/2 ~ ~rr/4 q3/27 + q/3~3 ~r/2 ~ ~rr/4 q3/27, or (if we put ss, as before, = rr/4 q3/27,) ~3 ~r/2 S + q/3~3 ~r/2 S. The other expression is ~3 ~r/2 + ~ ~rr/4 q3/27 + ~3 ~r/2 ~ ~rr/4 q3/27, or ~3 ~r/2 + S + ~3 ~r/2 S. These expressions are to be found in the following manner. Investigation of the said Expressions. 9. In Art. 5. we supposed the line x to be divided into 912 Extension of Cardan's Rule to the to two unequal parts a and b, of which a was supposed to be the greater; and we first found the value of the greater part a, and then determined that of the lesser part b from its relation to a, which is expressed by the equation 3ab = q. But we may with the same ease first determine the value of the lesser part b, and then derive from it that of the greater part a; which would produce the first of the two expressions of the value of x mentioned in the last article. This may be done as follows. Since it has been shewn in Art. 5. that r is = a3 + b3, and 3ab is = q, and consequently a is = q/3b, and a3 to q3/27b, it follows that r will be = q3/27b3 + b3. Therefore rb3 is = q3/27 + b6, and (subtracting b6 from both sides) rb3 b6 is = q3/27. Therefore (subtracting both sides from rr/4, than which they are evidently less), we shall have rr/4 rb3 + b6 = rr/4 q3/27. Therefore the square-root of rr/4 rb3 + b6 will be = ~ ~rr~4 q3/27. But the square-root of rr/4 rb3 + b6 is the difference of the quantities r/2 and b3, that is (because b3 is the lesser part of a3 + b3, or r, and consequently is less than the half of it, or r/2), it is = r/2 b3. Therefore r/2 b3 is = ~ ~rr/4 q3/27, Therefore (adding b3 to both sides) r/2 will be = b3 + ~ Second Case of the Cubick Equation x3-qx=r. 913 ~rr/4-q3/27, and (subtracting ~rr/4-q3/27 from both sides) b3 will be=r/2-~rr/4-q3/27. Therefore b is =~3r/2-~rr/4-q3/27, and a(=q/3b) is q/3~3r/2-~rr/4-q3/27, and consequently b+a, or a+b, or x, is =~3r/2-~rr/4-q3/27 + q/3~3r/2-~rr/4-q3/27, or (if we put ss=rr/4-q3/27) ~3r/2-s+q/3~3r/2-s Q.E.I. Synthetick demonstration of the truth of the foregoing expression. 10. Here again we may demonstrate synthetically, that this expression is equal to the true value of x in the proposed equation x3-qx=r, by substituting it for x in the left-hand side of that equation. For, if we make that substitution, we shall find that the value of x3-qx thence arising will be equal to r. This may be done in the manner following. If x is=~3r/2-s+q/3~3r/2-s, or r/2-s1/3+ q/3 x r/2-s 1/3, we shall have x3=r/s-s+3x r/2-s 2/3 x q/3 x r/2 s 1/3 + 3 x r/2 s 1/3 x VOL. LXVIII. 5 X qq 914 Extension of Cardan's Rule to the qq/9 x r/2 s 2/3 + q3/27 x r/2 s = r/2 s + q x r/2 s 1/3 + qq/3 x r/2 s 1/3 + q3/27 x r/2 s, and qx = q x r/2 s 1/3 + qq/3 x r/2 s 1/3, and consequently x3 qx = r/2 s + q3/27 x r/2 s = r/2 s + q3/27r/2 27s = r/2 s + q3/27r/2 54s/2 = r/2 s + 2q3/27r 54s. Now ss, or rr/4 q3/27 is = 27rr 4q3/108 = 27rr 4q3/36 x 3. Therefore if we put mm = 27rr 4q3, we shall have ss = mm/36 x 3, and s = m/6 ~3. Therefore 2q3/27r 54s is = 2q3/27r 54m/6 ~3 = 2q3/6 x 27 x ~3 x r 54m/6 ~3 = 12 ~3 x q3/6 x 27 x ~3 x r 54m = 2 ~3 x q3/27 x ~3 x r 9m. Therefore r/2 s + 2q3/27r 54s is = r/2 m/6 ~3 + 2 ~3 x q3/27 x ~3 x r 9m = r/2 27 x ~3 x rm + 9mm + 36q3/6 x 27 x 3r 54 ~3 x m = r/2 3 ~3 x rm + mm + 4q3/54r 6 ~3 x m = r/2 -3 ~3 x rm + 27rr 4q3 + 4q3/54r 6 ~3 x m = r/2 -3 ~3 x rm + 27rr/54r 6 ~3 x m = 54rr 6 ~3 x rm 6 ~3 x rm + 54rr/108r 12 ~3 x m = 108rr 12 ~3 x rm/108r 12 ~3 x m = r. But it has been before shewn that x3 qx is = r/2 s + 2q3/27r 54s. Therefore x3 qx is = r; and ~3 r/2 s + q/3 ~3 r/2 s is the true value of x in the cubick equation x3 qx = r. Q. E. D. Investigation Second Case of the Cubick Equation x3 qx = r. 915 Investigation of the third expression of the value of the root x. 11. The third expression for the value of x, or the last of the two mentioned in Art. 8. to wit, ~3 r/2 + ~ rr/4 q3/27 + ~3 r/2 ~ rr/4 q3/27, or ~3 r/2 + s + ~3 r/2 s, may be obtained as follows. Since a3 + b3 is = r, it follows that b3 will be = r a3. But a3 is shewn in Art. 5. to be = r/2 + ~ rr/4 q3/27. Therefore r a3 is = r r/2 + ~ rr/4 q3/27 = r/2 ~ rr/4 q3/27. Consequently b3 is = r/2 ~ rr/4 q3/27, and b is = ~3 r/2 ~ rr/4 q3/27, and a + b, or x, is = ~3 r/2 + ~ rr/4 q3/27 + ~3 r/2 ~ rr/4 q3/27, or (putting ss, as before, = rr/4 q3/27,) ~3 r/2 + s + ~3 r/2 s. Q. E. I. Synthetick demonstration of the truth of the said third expression. 12. Here again we may demonstrate synthetically, that this expression is equal to the true value of x in the equation x3 qx = r, by substituting it for x in the lefthand side of the said equation. For, if we make that substitution, we shall find that the value of x3 qx, 5 X 2 thence 916 Extension of Cardan's Rule to the thence arising, will be equal to r. This may be done in the following manner. If x is = ~3 ~r/2 + s + ~3 ~r/2 s, or ~r/2 + s~1/3 + ~r/2 s~1/3, we shall have x3 = r/2 + s + 3 x ~r/2 + s~2/3 x ~r/2 s~1/3 + 3 x ~r/2 + s~1/3 x ~r/2 s~2/3 + r/2 s = r + 3 x ~r/2 + s~2/3 x ~r/2 s~1/3 + 3 x ~r/2 + s~1/3 x ~r/2 s~2/3 = r + 3 x ~r/2 + s~1/3 x ~r/2 + s~1/3 x ~r/2 s~1/3 + 3 x ~~/2 + s~1/3 x ~r/2 s~1/3 x ~r/2 s~1/3 = r + 3 x ~r/2 + s~1/3 x ~rr/4 ss~1/3 + 3 x ~rr/4 ss~1/3 x ~r/2 s~1/3 = r + 3 x ~r/2 + s~1/3 x ~rr/4 rr/4 + ~/27~1/3 + 3 x ~rr/4 rr/4 + q3/27~1/3 x ~r/2 s~1/3 = r + 3 x ~r/2 + s~1/3 x ~q3/27 ~1/3 + 3 x ~q3/27~1/3 x ~r/2 s~1/3 = r + 3 x ~r/2 + s~1/3 x q/3 + 3 x q/3 x ~r/2 s~1/3 = r + q x ~r/2 + s~1/3 + q x ~r/2 s~1/3. And qx will be = q x ~r/2 + s~1/3 + q x ~r/2 s~1/3. Therefore x3 qx will be = r + q x ~r/2 + s~1/3 + q x ~r/2 s~1/3 q x ~r/2 + s~1/3 q x ~r/2 s~1/3 = r; and consequently ~r/2 + s~1/3 + ~r/2 s~1/3, or ~3 ~r/2 + s + ~3 ~r/2 s~, is the true value of x in the cubick equation x3 qx = r. 13. N. B. I do not remember to have seen these substitutions, or synthetical demonstrations of the truth of the expressions given by CARDAN'S rule, in any book of algebra. 14. An Second Case of the Cubick Equation x3 qx = r. 917 14. An Example of the Resolution of a Cubick Equation of the aforesaid Form, x3 qx = r, by means of each of the three foregoing Expressions. I will here insert a single example of a numeral equation of the foregoing form, x3 qx = r, resolved by each of the three expressions above-mentioned, in order to shew that they will all three bring out the same number for its root. Let it therefore be required to find the value of x in the cubick equation x3 3x = 18. 15. In this equation q is = 3, and r is = 18. Therefore ~q is = ~3, and 2q ~q/3~3 is = 2 x 3 ~3/3~3 = 2, which is greatly less than 18, or r. Therefore this equation comes under the above-mentioned rule, and may be resolved by either of the foregoing expressions. Resolution of the equation x3 3x = 18 by the first of the said expressions. 16. The first of those expressions is ~3 ~r/2 + s + q/3~3 ~r/2 + s, in which s stands for ~~rr/4 q3/27. Now 918 Extension of Cardan's Rule to the Now, since q is = 3, q/3 will be = 3/3 = 1, and consequently q3/27, or the cube of q/3, will also be = 1. And, since r is = 18, we shall have r/2 = 9, and rr/4 = 81, and consequently rr/4 q3/27 = 81 1 = 80; that is, ss will be = 80. Therefore s is = ~80 = ~16 x ~5 = 4~5; and r/2 + s is = 9 + 4 ~5 = 72 + 32 ~5/8 = 27 + 27 ~5 + 45 + 5 ~5/8; and consequently ~3 ~r/2 + s is = 3 + ~5/2. Therefore 3 x ~3 ~r/2 + s is = 3 x ~3 + ~5/2, and q/3~3 ~r/2 + s is = 3 x 2/3 x 3 + ~5 = 2/3 + ~5; and ~3 ~r/2 + s + q/3~3 ~r/2 + s is = 3 + ~5/2 + 2/3 + ~5 = 3 + ~5~ x 3 + ~5 + 4/2 x 3 + ~5 = 9 + 6 ~5 + 5 + 4/2 x ~3 + ~5 = 18 + 6 ~5/2 x ~3 + ~5 = 6 x 3 + ~5/2 x ~3 + ~5 = 6/2 = 3. Therefore 3 is the value of x in the equation x3 3x = 18. And so we shall find it to be upon trial: for, if x is taken = 3, we shall have x3 = 27, and 3x = 3 x 3 = 9, and x3 3x = 27 9 = 18. And thus we see that the first of the three foregoing expressions, to wit, ~3 ~r/2 + s + q/3~3 ~r/2 + s, has given us the true value of x in this equation. Resolution Second Case of the Cubick Equation x3 qx = r. 919 Resolution of the same equation by the second and third of the foregoing expressions. 17. We are now to resolve the same equation x3 3x = 18 by means of the two other expressions, to wit, ~ 3 ~ r/2 S + q/3 ~ 3 ~ r/2 S, and ~ 3 ~ r/2 + S + ~ 3 ~ r/2 S. Now, since r is = 18, and s has been shewn to be = ~ 80, or 4 ~ 5, we shall have r/2 S = 9 4 ~ 5 = 72-32 ~ 5/8 = 27 27 ~ 5 + 45 5 ~ 5/8, and ~ 3 ~ r/2 S = 3 ~ 5/2. Therefore 3 ~ 3 ~ r/2 S is = 3 X 3 ~ 5/2, and q/3 ~ 3 ~ r/2 S is = 3/3 x 3 ~ 5/2 = 3 x 2/3 x 3 ~ 5 = 2/3 ~ 5. Consequently ~ 3 ~ r/2 S + q/3 ~ ~ ~ r/2 S is = 3 ~ 5/2 + 2/3 ~ 5 = 3 ~ 5 x 3 ~ 5 + 4/2 x 3 ~ 5 = 9 6 ~ 5 + 5 + 4/2 x 3 ~ 5 = 18 6 ~ 5/2 x 3 ~ 5 = 9 3 ~ 5/3 ~ 5 = 3 x 3 ~ 5/3 ~ 5 = 3. Therefore x is = 3, as it was found to be by the first expression. 18. The third expression ~ 3 ~ r/2 + S + ~ 3 ~ r/2 S is in the present case = 3 + ~ 5/2 + 3 ~ 5/2 = 6/2 = 3. Therefore by this expression, as well as by both the former, the value of x in the equation x3 3x = 18 comes out to be 3. 6 19. Note. 920 Extension of Cardan's Rule to the 19. Note. The foregoing method of resolving the cubick equation x3 qx = r, when r is greater than 2q ~ q/3 ~ 3, or rr/4 is greater than q3/27, and a like method of resolving the cubick equation x3 + qx = r (which holds good in all cases, whatever be the magnitudes of q and r), are usually known by the name of CARDAN'S rules, because they were first published by him in his treatise of algebra, intitled, Ars magna, quam vulgo Cossam vocant, seu regulas Algebraicas, in the year 1545, although, as he himself informs us, they were first found out by one SCIPIO FERREUS of Bononia. See WALLIS'S algebra, Chap. XIII. Of the second case of the cubick equation x qx = r; in which r is less than 2q ~ q/3 ~ 3, or rr/4 is less than q3/27, and which cannot be resolved by CARDAN'S rule. 20. The remaining case of the cubick equation x3 qx = r, in which r is less than 2q ~ q/3 ~ 3, or rr/4 is less than q3/27, and which consequently cannot be resolved by the rules above-mentioned, has, upon that account, obtained amongst algebraists the name of the irreducible case: at least it is often called by the French writers of algebra le cas irreductible. The object of the remaining pages of Second Case of the Cubick Equation x3 qx = r. 921 of this paper is to shew how, by the help of Sir ISAAC NEWTON'S famous binomial theorem, the foregoing solution of the other, or first, case of this equation may be, as it were, extended to this latter case, or, rather, may be made the means of discovering, by a very peculiar train of reasoning, another solution, that shall be adapted to it. 21. By the binomial theorem it appears that the cuberoot of the binomial quantity a + b (in which a is supposed to be greater than b) is equal to the following in1 1 1 1 1 finite series, to wit, a13 + a3b/3a a3b2/9a2 + 5a3b3/81a3 10a3b4/243a4 + 22a3b5/729a5 1 1 154a3b6/6561a6 + 2618a3b7/137,781a7 &c. or to a1/3 x the infinite series 1 + b/3a b2/9a2 + 5b3/81a3 10b4/243a4 + 22b5/729a5 154b6/6561a6 + 2618b7/137,781a7 &c. or (if we put the capital letters A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, &c. for the several numeral coefficients, 1, 1/3, 1/9, 5/81, 10/243, 22/729, 154/6561, 26~8/137,781, &c. of the terms of the series, respectively,) a1/3 x the infinite series 1 + 1Ab/3a 2Bb2/6a2 + 5Cb3/9a3 8Db4/12a4 + 11Eb5/15a5 14Fb6/18a6 + 17Gb7/21a7 &c. in which series both the numerators and the denominators of the generating fractions, 2/6, 5/9, 8/12, 11/15, 14/18, 17/21, &c. following the second term, increase continually by 3, so that it will be easy for any one to continue the series to as many terms as he shall think proper. 22.

P R O B L E M. 23. Let it now be required to resolve the first case of the cubick equation x3 qx = r, in which r is greater than 2q~q/3~3, or rr/4 is greater than q3/27, by means of an infinite series derived from the expressions given by C A R D A N'S rule. S O L U T I O N. We have seen in Art. 11. that, if ss be put = rr/4 q3/27, the value of x in this equation will be = ~3~r/2 + s + ~3 Second Case of the Cubick Equation x3-qx=r. 923 ~3~r/2-s. For the sake of avoiding fractions, let e be put =r/2. And we shall have x=~3~e + s +~3~e-s. But (by Art. 21.) ~3~e + s is = e1/3 x the infinite series 1 + s/3e ss 9ee + 5s3/81e3 10s4/243e4 + 22s5/729e5 154s6/6561e6 + 2618s7/137,781e7 &c; and, by Art. 22. ~3~e-s is = e1/3 x the infinite series 1 s/3e ss/9ee 5s3/81e3 10s4/243e4 22s5/729e5 154s6/6561e6 2618s7/137,781e7 &c. Therefore ~3~e+s + ~3~e s is equal to e1/3 x the sum of these two serieses, that is, to e1/3 x the infinite series 2 2ss/9ee 20s4/243e4 308s6/6561e6 &c; and consequently the root of the equation x3 qx = r is = e1/3 x the infinite series 2 2ss/9ee 20s4/243e4 308s6/6561e6 &c. ad infinitum. Q. E. F. 24. Note. This series must always converge, because ss, or rr/4 q3/27, is always less than rr/4, or ee. And, when ss is considerably less than ee, or rr/4 q3/27 is considerably less than rr/4, or rr/4 is very little greater than q3/27, the convergency of the terms of this series will be sufficient to make it useful. But in other cases, when rr/4 is much greater than q3/27, (as when it is triple, quadruple or quintuple of it, or still greater,) the terms of this series will converge so slowly as to render it very unfit for practice. And indeed in the most favourable cases it will, as I believe, be less convenient in practice than the expression 5 Y 2 ~~ 924 Extension of Cardan's Rule to the ~3~e+s +~3~e-s, or ~3~r/2+ s +~3~r/2s, from which it was derived. However, that it may appear that this series will exhibit the root of the equation x3-qx=r truly, if we will take the necessary pains of computing it, I will here subjoin one example, and no more, of the resolution of a cubick equation of that form by means of it, having taken care to chuse such numbers for q and r as shall make rr/4 be but little greater than q3/27, and consequently shall give us only a small number for the fraction ss/ee, by the continual multiplication of which the terms of the series are generated. An example of the resolution of a cubick equation of the aforesaid form, x3-qx=r, in the first case of it, in which r is greater than 2q ~q/3 ~3, or rr/4 is greater than q3/27, by means of the expression e1/3 x the infinite series 2 2ss/9ee 20s4/243e4 308s6/6561e6 &c. obtained in Art. 23. 25. Let it be required to resolve the equation x3 300x = 2108 by means of the infinite series e1/3 x ~2 2ss/9ee 20s4/243e4 308s6/6561e6 &c. obtained in Art. 23. by the help of Sir ISAAC NEWTON'S binomial theorem. Here Second Case of the Cubick Equation x4-qx=r. 925 Here q is = 300, and r is = 2108. Therefore 2q~q/3~3 is = 2 x 300 x ~300/3 x ~3 = 2 x 100 x ~300/~3 = 2 x 100 x 10~3/~3 = 2 x 100 x 10 = 2000, which is less than 2108, or ~. Therefore this equation comes under the case of CARDAN'S rule, and consequently may be resolved by means of the infinite series e 1/3 x ~2 2ss/9ee 20s4/243e4 308s6/6561e6 &c. if that series has been justly derived from the third expression of the value of x given by CARDAN's rule. 26. Now, since r is = 2108, r/2, or e, will be = 1054, and rr/4, or ee, will be = 1,110,916. And, since q is = 300, q/3 will be = 100, and q3/27, or the cube of q/3, will be = 1000,000; and consequently ss, or rr/4 q3/27, will be (= 1,110,916 1000,000) = 110,916. Therefore, the fraction ss/ee is = 110,916/1,110,916 =.0998. Therefore s4/e4 is =.0998~2 =.009,950, and s6/e6 is =.0998~3 =.000,992; and 2ss/9ee is = 2/9 x.0998 =.1996/9 =.022,177; and 20s4/24 e4 is = 20/243 x.009,950 =.199,000/243 =.000,818; and 308s6/6561e6 is=308/6561 x.000,992 =.305,536/6561 =.000,046; and consequently, 2ss/9ee + 20s4/243e4 + 308s6/6561e6 is =.022,177 +.000,818, +.000,046 =.023,041; and 2 2ss/9ee 20s4/243e4 308s6/6561e6 is=2-.023,041 = 926 Extension of Cardan's Rule to the = 1.976,959. But e is = 1054. Consequently, e1/3, or ~3e, is = ~31054=10.1768. Therefore e1/3 x the series 2 2ss/9ee 20s4/243e4 308s6/6561e6 &c. is = 10.1768 x 1.976,959 = 20.119,116. Therefore the root of the equation x3 300 x = 2108 is = 20.119,116. Q. E. I. 27. This value of x is true to five places of figures, the~ more accurate value of it being 20.119,053, as will easily appear by prosecuting it to three or four more places of figures by Mr. RAPHSON'S method of approximation. 28. That 20.119 is very nearly equal to, but somewhat less than, the true value of x in the equation x3 300x = 2108, will appear by substituting it instead of x in the left-hand side of that equation. For, if we take x = 20.119, we shall have xx = 404.774,161, and x3 = 8143.651,345,159, and 300x = 6035.700; and consequently, x3 300x = 8143.651,345,159, 6035.700 = 2107.951,345,159, which is somewhat less than 2108, or the accurate value of x3 300 x in the proposed equation x3 300x = 2108. Therefore, 20.119 must be nearly equal to, but somewhat less than, the accurate value of x in that equation. 29. It appears therefore from this example, that this expression, e1/3 x the infinite series 2 2ss/9ee 20s4/243e4 308s6/6561e6 &c. does truly exhibit the root of the equation 4 x3 Second Case of the Cubick Equation x4-qx=r. 927 x3 qx = r in that case of it which falls under CARDAN'S rule, or in which r is greater than 2q~q/3~3, or rr/4 is greater than q3/27. 30. I now proceed to consider the problem which is the principal object of this paper, which is to shew how from the series e 1/3 x ~2 2ss 9ee 20s4/243s4 308s6/6561s6 &c. we may derive another series, differing from it only in the signs of some of the terms, by which the equation x3 qx = r may be resolved in that other case of it which does not come under CARDAN'S rule, and in which r is less than 2q~/3~3, or rr/4 is less than q3/27: and this without any mention of either impossible or negative quantities. P R O B L E M. To resolve, by means of an infinite series derived from the infinite series e 1/3 x ~2 2ss/9ee 20s4/243e4 308s6/6561e6 &c. the second case of the cubick equation x3-qx=r, in which r is less than 2q~q/3~3, or rr/4 is less than q3/27. S O L U T I O N. 31. We have seen that in the first case of the eequation x3-qx=r, in which rr/4 is greater than q3/27, the product 928 Extension of Cardan's Rule to the duct of e 1/3 into the series 2 2ss/9ee 20s4/243e4 308s6/6561e6 &c. ad infinitum, is equal to the root x. Now there are two different ways of computing this series, which (though not equally short and convenient in practice) are nevertheless equally just and true: and therefore they must both produce the same result for the value of the series. The first way of computing it is the common one, which consists of the following processes; to wit, first, to compute the quantities rr/4 and q3/27, as was done in the foregoing example, art. 26, where rr/4 was found to be = 1,110,916, and q3/27 to be 1000,000; 2dly, to ~ q3/27 from rr/4, in order to get the quantity ss, which is equal to their difference, and which in the foregoing example was 110,916; 3dly, to divide ss by ee, so as to obtain the value of the fraction ss/ee; as in the foregoing example we found the fraction 110,916/1,110,916 to be =.0998; 4thly, to compute the powers of the value found for the fraction ss/ee; as in the foregoing example we computed those of .0998, and found its square to be.009,950, and its cube to be.000,992; 5thly, to multiply ss/ee, and its powers s4/e4, s6/e6, &c. into the co-efficients 2/9, 20/243, 308/6561, &c. respectively, Second Case of the Cubick Equation x3-qx=r. 929 respectively, as in the foregoing example we multiplied .0998 into 2/9, and.009,950 into 20/243, and.000,992 into 308/6561, and found the products to be.022,117,.000,818, and.000,046; and 6thly, to subtract all the products so obtained from 2 the first term of the series. This is the common and the proper way of computing the series 2 2ss/9ee 20s4/243e4 308s6/6561e6 &c. when we want to make use of it in practice. But it may also be computed in another manner, which may be described as as follows. Instead of ss insert the compound quantity rr/4 q3/27 itself, to which ss is equal, in all the terms of it. And it will be thereby converted into the following series, to wit, 2 2/9ee x ~r/4-q3/27 20/243e4 x rr/4 q~/27 2 308/6561e6 x rr/4 q3/27 3 &c. or (because ee is =rr/4, and consequently e4=r4/16, and e6=r6/64) 2 8/9rr x rr/4 q~/27 320/243r4 x rr/4 q3/27 2 19712/6561r6 x ~r/4 q~/27 3 &c. or 2 8/9rr x rr/4 q3/27 320/243r4 x 4/16 2rrq~/4 x 27 + q6/27 x 27 19712/~ x r6/64 3~4q3/16 x 27 + 3rrq6/4 x 27 x 27 q9/27 x 27 x 27 &c. or (putting the Greek letters ~,~,~, &c. for the numeral co-efficients 8/9, 320/243, 19712/6561, &c. respectively) 2 ~/rr x rr/4 q3/27 ~/r4 x r4/16 2rrq3/4 x 27 + q6/27 x 27 ~/r6 x r6/64 3~4q3/16 x 27 + 3rrq6/4 x 27 x 27 q9/27 x 27 x 27 VOL. LXVIII. 5 Z &c. 930 Extension of Cardan's Rule to the &c. or 2 ~/4 + ~q3/27rr ~/16 + 2~q3/4 x 27rr ~q6/27 x 27 x r4 ~/64 + 3~q~/16 x 27rr 3~q6/4 x 27 x 27r4 + ~q9/27 x 27 x 27r~ &c. which consists of a much greater number of terms than the series 2 2ss/9ee 20s4/243e4 308s6/~ &c. from which it is derived, and in which many of the terms are much more complicated than in that former series. Nevertheless, since the compound quantity rr/4 q3/27 is equal to ss, the insertion of it instead of ss in the terms of that former series cannot alter its real value, though it will make it much more difficult to compute. It must therefore be true of the new and complicated series 2 ~/4 + ~q3/27rr ~/16 + 2~q3/4 x 27rr ~q6/27 x 27~4 ~/64 + 3~q3 16 x 27rr 3~q6/4 x 27 x 27r4 + ~q9/27 x 27 x 27r6 &c. as well as of the former series 2 2ss/9ee 20s4/243e4 308s6/6561e6 &c. that, if it be multiplied into e 1/3, or ~3 e, or ~3r/2, the series thereby produced will be equal to the value of x in the equation x3-qx=r, or that, if the said series be cubed, and also multiplied into q, and from its cube the product of its multiplication into q be subtracted, the remainder will be equal to r, or rather will approximate to the value of r, because, as the quantity substituted for x in the compound quantity x3-qx is only a part of an infinite series q that Second Case of the Cubick Equation x3-qx=r. 931 that is equal to x, it is impossible that the said remainder (which is produced by that substitution) should be accurately equal to the whole value of r. 32. By the help of this observation we may from the foregoing series 2 2ss/9ee 20s4/243e4 308s6/6561e6 &c. which, being multiplied into e 1/3, or the cube-root of r/2, expresses the value of x in the equation x3-qx=r, in the first case of that equation, when rr/4 is greater than q3/27, deduce another series resembling the former in the composition of its terms, but differing from it in the signs to be prefixed to some of them, that will likewise (if multiplied into e 1/3, or the cube-root of r/2) express the value of x in the second case of the same equation, in which rr/4 is less than q3/27, and which cannot be resolved by CARDAN'S rules. This may be done as follows. 33. If in this second case of the equation x3-qx=r we subtract rr/4 from q3/27, and call the remainder ss (as we before put ss for the opposite difference rr/4 q3/27) and then ~ the powers of ss, to wit, s4, s6, s8, s10, and also the correspondent powers of its value q3/27 r4/4, to wit, q3/27 rr/4~2, q3/27 rr/4~3, q3/27 rr/4~4, q3/27 rr/4~5, &c. the even 5 Z 2 powers 932 Extension of Cardan's Rule to the powers of the difference q3/27 rr/4, to wit, q3/27 rr/4~2, q~/27 rr/4~4, &c. will consist of the very same terms, or the same powers, products, and multiples of the two original quantities rr/4 and q3/27, and with the same signs + and prefixed to them, as were before contained in the even powers of the opposite difference rr/4 q3/27, when rr/4 was greater than q3/27. Thus, for example, the square of rr/4 q3/27 in the former case was r4/16 2rrq3/4 x 27 + q6/27 x 27; and in the present case the square of q3/27 rr/4 is q6/27 x 27 2q3rr/27 x 4 + r4/16, which consists of the same terms, and with the same signs prefixed to them, as were contained in the square of rr/4 q3/27, and differs from it only in the order in which the extreme terms r4/16 and q6/27 x 27 are placed. And the same observation is true concerning all the other even powers of the opposite differences rr/4 q3/27 and q3/27 rr/4. Also the odd powers of the difference q3/27 rr/4, to wit, q3/27 rr/4 itself, and q~/27 rr/4~3, q3/27 rr/4~5, &c. will consist of the same terms, or of the same powers, products, and multiples of the two original quantities rr/4 and q3/27, as were contained in the same odd powers of the opposite difference rr Second Case of the Cubick Equation x3-qx=r. 933 rr/4 q3/27, when rr/4 was greater than q3/27. But the signs prefixed to the said terms will be contrary to those which were prefixed to them in the former case. Thus, the cube of rr/4 q3/27 in the former case was r6/64 3r4q3/16 x 27 + 3rrq6/4 x 27 x 27 q9/27 x 27 x 27; and the cube of q3/27 rr/4 in the present case is q9/27 x 27 x 27 3q6rr/27 x 27 x 4 + 3q3r4/27 x 16 r6/64, which consists of the same terms as are contained in the cube of rr/4 q3/27: but they are placed in a contrary order to that in which they stood in the former case; and the signs that are prefixed to them are contrary in every term to what they were before. And the same is true of all the other odd powers of these opposite differences of rr/4 and q3/27. 34. It follows, therefore, that if ss be put for q3/27 rr/4 in this latter case of the equation x3-qx=r, in which rr/4 is less than q3/27, the even powers of ss, to wit, s4, s8, s12, s16, &c. will represent, or be equal to, the same powers, products, and multiples of the two original quantities rr/4 and q3/27 in the present case as they represented in the former case, when rr/4 was greater than q3/27, and ss was made to stand for rr/4 q3/27; and the several terms represented by the said even powers of ss will have the same signs 934 Extension of Cardan's Rule to the signs + and prefixed to them respectively in this second case as in the first case. And it likewise follows that the odd powers of ss, to wit, ss, s6, s10, s14, &c. will also represent, or be equal to, the same powers, products, and multiples of the two original quantities rr/4 and q3/27, as in the former case; but the signs + and prefixed to the several terms represented by the said odd powers of ss will be contrary to what they were before. 35. If therefore in this second case of the equation x3 qx = r, in which rr/4 is less than q3/27, we put ss = q3/27 rr/4, the series 2 2ss/9ee 20s4/243e4 308s6/6561e6 &c. will represent, or be equal to, a system of terms, derived from the two original quantities rr/4 and q3/27, that will be the very same in point of composition, that is, will be the very same powers, products, and multiples of rr/4 and q3/27, as the terms that were represented by it in the former case, in which rr/4 was greater than q3/27: but the terms so represented will not all have the same signs + and prefixed to them as they had before; but those terms in the said system, which are represented by the terms of the series 2 ~/9ee 20s4/243c4 368s6/6561e6 &c. which involve the even powers of ss, to wit, 20s4/243e4, &c. will have the same signs prefixed Second Case of the Cubick Equation x3 qx = r. 935 prefixed to them as they had before when ss stood for rr/4 q3/27; and those terms of the said system which are represented by the terms of the said series which involve the odd powers of ss, to wit, 2ss/9ee and 308s6/6561e~, &c. will have contrary signs to those they had before. Consequently, if we change the signs of those terms in the series 2 2ss/9ee 20s4/243e4 308s6/6561e6 &c. which involve the odd powers of ss, to wit, the terms 2ss/9ee and 308s6/6561e6 &c. the new series thereby produced, to wit, 2 + 2ss/9ee 20s4/243e4 + 308s6/6561e6 &c. will represent, or be equal to, a system of terms which will not only be the very same in point of composition (or will be the same powers, products, and multiples of the two original quantities rr/4 and q3/27), as those which were represented by the series 2 2ss/9ee 20s4/243e4 308s6/6561e6 &c. in the former case, but will also be connected with each other in exactly the same manner by the signs + and -: that is, by Art. 31. the said new series will represent, or be equal to, the following system of terms, to wit, 2 ~/4 + ~q3/27rr ~/16 + 2~q3/4 x 27rr ~q6/27 x 27r4 r/64 + 3~q3/16 x 27rr 3~q6/4 x 27 x 27r4 + ~q9/27 x 27 x 27r6 &c. But 936 Extension of Cardan's Rule to the But it has been shewn (in Art. 31.) that, if this system of terms be multiplied into 1/e3, or the cube-root of r/2, and the series thence produced be cubed, and also multiplied into q, and from its cube the product of its multiplication into q be subtracted, the remainder thereby obtained will be (nearly) equal to r. Therefore, if the series 2 + 2ss/9ee 20s4/243e4 + 308s6/6561e6 &c. (which represents, or is equal to, the said system of terms, when rr/4 is less than q3/27, and ss is made = q3/27 rr/4,) be multiplied by 1/e3, or the cube-root of r/2, and the series thence produced be cubed, and also multiplied into q, and from the cube of the said series the product of its multiplication into q be subtracted, it will follow that the remainder thereby obtained will be (nearly) equal to r; that is, the product of the multiplication of 1/e3, or the cube-root of r/2, into the infinite series 2 + 2ss/9ee 20s4/243e4 + 308s6/6561e6 &c. is equal to the value of x in the equation x3 qx = r in the second case of it, when rr/4 is less than q3/27. Q. E. I. 36. This series 2 + 2ss/9ee 20s4/243e4 + 308s6/6561e6 &c. does not always converge, but only when ss is less than ee, or 93/27 rr/4 is less than rr/4, or 93/27 is less than 2rr/4, or rr/4 is greater than half Second Case of the Cubick Equation x3-qx=r. 937 half q3/27, or than q3/54, though less than q3/27. And the nearer rr/4 approaches to q3/27, the greater will be the swiftness with which this series will converge. 37. I will now add a few examples of the resolution of cubick equations of the aforesaid form, x3-qx=r, in the second case of those equations, in which r is less than 2q~q/3~3, or rr/4 is less than q3/27, by means of the infinite series e1/3 x ~ 2 + 2ss/9ee 20s4/243e4 + 308s6/6561e6 &c. found in Art. 35. in order to confirm the truth of the reasonings by which that series was obtained. E X A M P L E I. 38. Let it be required to resolve the equation x3 50x = 120 by means of the said infinite series. Here q is = 50; r is = 120; r/2 or e, is = 60; rr/4, or ee, is = 3600; q3 is = 125,000; and q3/27 is = 125,000/27 = 4629. 629,629,629, &c. which is greater than 3600, or r/2. Therefore this equation cannot be resolved by CARDAN'S rule, but may by the expression e1/3 x the series 2 + 2ss/9ee 20s4/243e4 + 308s6/6561e6 &c. provided that series converges. Now, since q3/27 is = 4629. 629, 629, 629, &c. V O L. LXVIII. 6 A and 938 Extension of Cardan's Rule to the and rr/4 is = 3600, we shall have ss = q3/27 rr/4 = 4629. 629, 629, 629, &c. 3600 = 1029. 629, 629, 629, &c. which is considerably less than 3600, or ee; and consequently the series will converge. 39. We shall therefore have ss/ee = 1029.629,629,629/3600 &c. =.286,00; and s4/e4 =.081,796; and s6/e6 =.023,393; and consequently 2ss/9ee = 2 x.286/9 =.572/9 =.063, 55; and 20s4/243e4 = 20 x.081,796/243 = 1.635,92/243 =.006,73; and 308s6/6561e6 = 308 x.023,393/6561 = 7.205,044/6561 =.001,098. Therefore 2 + 2ss/9ee 20s4/243e4 + 308s6/6561e6 is = 2+.063,55-.006,73+.001,09=2.064,64-.006,73 = 2.057,91. And e1/3, or ~3e, is = ~3~60 = 3.914,867. Therefore e1/3 x the series 2 + 2ss/9ee 20s4/243e4 + 308s6/6561e6 &c. is = 3.914, 867 x 2.057, 91 = 8.0564; that is, the root of the proposed equation x3-50x=120 is 8.0564; which is true in three places of figures, the error being in the fourth place of figures, or third place of decimal fractions, where the figure ought to be a 5 instead of a 6, the more accurate value of x in that equation being 8.055,810,345,702, as may easily be found by Mr. RAPHSON'S method of approximation. But 8.0564, the value of x found by the foregoing process, is sufficiently near to its more accurate value 8.055,810,&c. to Second Case of the Cubick Equation x3-qx=r. 939 to shew the truth of the foregoing reasonings. Their difference is only 6/10,000 parts of an unit, which is only the 13426th part of 8.055,810, &c. or the true value of x. 40. N. B. This equation x3-50x=120 expresses the relation between the diameter of a circle and three chords in it that lie contiguous to each other, and together take up a semicircle, and form a trapezium of which the diameter of the circle is the fourth side. For if the three chords are called b, k and t, and the diameter of the circle is called x, the relation between them will be ex-bb pressed by the cubick equation x3 kk x x = 2bkt, which, -tt if the numbers 3, 4 and 5 are substituted instead of the letters b, k, and t, will become x3-50x=120. See Sir ISAAC NEWTON'S Arithmetica Universalis, Edit. 2d. 1722, page 101. E X A M P L E II. 41. Let it be required to find by means of the same series the root of the equation x3-x=1/3. Now in this equation q is = 1, r is =1/3, r/2 is = 1/6, rr/4, or ee, is = 1/36, and q3/27 is = 1/27, which is greater than 1/36 6 A 2 or 940 Extension of Cardan's Rule to the or rr/4. Therefore this equation cannot be resolved by C A R D A N'S rule, but may by the series e1/3 x 2 + + 2ss/9ee 20s4/243e4 308s6/6561e6 &c. in case that series is a converging one. Now, since q3/27 is = 1/27, and rr/4 is = 1/36, we shall have ss, or q3/27 rr/4, = 1/27 1/36 = 36 27/27 x 36 = 9/27 x 36 = 1/3 x 36, which is less than 1/36, or ee, in the proportion of 1 to 3. Consequently the series 2 + 2ss/9ee 20s4/243e4 + 308s6/6561e6 &c. and the series e1/3 x 2 + 2ss/9ee 20s4/243e4 + 308s6/6561s6 &c. will converge. Therefore the equation x3 x = 1/3 may be resolved by the means of it as follows. 42. Since ss is = 1/3 x 36, and rr/4, or ee, is = 1/36, we shall have ss/ee = 1/3 =.333,333, and s4/e4 = 1/9 =.111,111, and s6/e6 = 1/27 =.037,037, and consequently 2ss/9ee = 2 x.333333/9 =.666666/9 = .074,074, and 20s4/243e4 = 20 x.111,111/243 = 2.222,222/243 =.009,144, and 308s6/6561e6 = 308 x.037,037/6561 = 11.407,396/6561 =.001,738. Therefore 2 + 2ss/9ee 20s4/243e4 + 308s6/6561e6 &c. is = 2 +.074,074 -.009,144 + .001,738 = 2.075,812 -.009,144 = 2.066,668. And ~3e is = ~3~1/6 = 1/~36 = 1/1.817,121. Therefore e1/3 x the series 2 + 2ss/9ee 20s4/243e4 + 308s6/6561e6 &c. is = 1/1.817,121 x 2.066,668 = 1.13733; Second Case of the Cubick Equation x3-qx=r. 941 1.13733; that is, the root of the proposed equation x3-x=1/3 is 1.137,33; which is true to four places of figures, the error being in the fifth place of figures, or the fourth place of decimal fractions, where the figure ought to be an unit instead of a 3, the more accurate value of x being 1.137,158,164, which differs from the value of it here found by less than.00017, or 17/100,000th parts of an unit, which is less than the 6689th part of 1.137,158,164, or the true value of x. E X A M P L E III. 43. Let it be required to find the root of the equation x3 5x = 4. Here q is = 5; r is = 4; r/2, or e, is = 2; rr/4, or ee, is = 4; q3 is = 125, and q3/27 is = 125/27 = 4.629,629,629, &c. which is greater than 4, or rr/4. Therefore this equation cannot be resolved by C A R D A N'S rule, but may by the infinite series e1/3 x ~ 2 + 2ss/9ee 20s4/243e4 + 308s6/6561e6 &c. in case that series is a converging one. Now, since q3/27 is 4.629,629,629, &c. and rr/4 is = 4, we shall have q3/27 rr/4, or ss, =.629,629,629, &c. which is 942 Extension of Cardan's Rule to the is less than 4, or ee, in the proportion of about 6 to 40, which is a pretty large proportion of minority, and much larger than the proportion of ss to ee in either of the former examples. Consequently the series e1/3 x ~ 2 + 2ss/9ee 20s4/243e4 + 308s6/6561e6 &c. will converge with a greater degree of swiftness than in either of those examples. Therefore the equation x3 5x = r may be resolved by it as follows. 44. Here ss/ee is =.629,629,&c./4 =.157,407; and consequently s4/e4 is =.024,777, and s6/e6 is =.003,900. Therefore 2ss/9ee is = 2 x.157,407/9 =.314,814/9 =.034,979, and 20s4/243e4 is = 20 x.024,777/243 =.495,540/243 = 002,039, and 308s6/6561e6 is = 308 x.003,900/6561 = 1.201,200/6561 =.000,182, and consequently 2 + 2ss/9ee 20s4/243e4 + 308s6/6561e6 is = 2 +.034,979-.002,039+.000,182=2.035,161.002,039 = 2.033,122. And e1/3, or ~3e, is = ~32 = 1.259,921. Therefore e1/3 x the series 2 + 2ss/9ee 20s4/243e4 + 308s6/6561e6 &c. is = 1.259,921 x 2.033,122 = 2.561,573; that is, the root of the proposed equation x3-5x=4 is 2.561,573; which is true to five places of figures, the error being in the sixth place of figures, or the fifth place of decimal fractions, where the figure ought to 6 be Second Case of the Cubick Equation x3-qx=r. 943 be a 5 instead of a 7. For the accurate value of x in this equation is 1+~17/2, or 1+4.123,106/2, or 5.123,106/2, or 2.561,553; which differs from 2.561,573, or the value of x found by the foregoing series, by only 20/1000,000th, or 2/100,000th, parts of an unit, or less than the 128,000th part of 2.561,553, or the value of x itself; which is a great degree of exactness. 45. Note. That x, or the root of the equation x3 5x=r, is accurately equal to 1+~17/2, will appear by substituting 1+~17/2 instead of x in the compound quantity x3-5x, and observing that it will make that quantity become equal to 4. For, if x is = 1+~17/2, we shall have x3 = 1 + 3 x ~ 17 + 3 x 17 + 17 x ~ 17/8 = 52 + 20 x ~ 17/8 = 13 + 5 ~ 17/2, and 5x = 5 + 5 ~ 17/2, and consequently x3 5x = 13 + 5 ~ 17/2 5 5 ~ 17/2 = 8/2 = 4. Therefore 1 + ~ 17/2 is = x. Q. E. D. 46. These examples sufficiently prove that the expression e1/3 x the series 2 + 2ss/9ee 20s4/243e4 + 308s6/6561e6 &c. (which we derived from the other series e1/3 x ~ 2 2ss/9ee 20s4/243e4 308s6/6561e6 &c. by the peculiar train of reasoning used in Art. 33, 34, and 35,) gives the true root of the cubick equation x3 qx = r 944 Extension of Cardan's Rule to the qx = r in the second case of it, in which r is less than 2q ~q/3 ~3, or rr/4 is less than q3/27, and which therefore cannot be resolved by CARDAN'S rule. I will, however, subjoin one more example to the same purpose; which shall be that of the equation x3 63x = 162, which both Dr. WALLIS and Mr. DE MOIVRE have resolved by extracting what they call the impossible cube-roots of the impossible binomial quantities 81 + ~ 2700 and 81 ~ 2700. Now this equation may be resolved by the foregoing expression e1/3 x the series 2 + 2ss/9ee 20s4/243e4 + 308s6/6561e6 &c. in the manner following. E X A M P L E 4. 47. Let it be required to find the root of the equation x3 63x = 162. Here q is = 63; r is = 162; r/2, or e, is = 81; rr/4, or ee, is = 6561; q/3 is = 21; and q3/27 is = 9261, which is greater than 6561, or rr/4. Therefore this equation cannot be resolved by CARDAN'S rule, but may by the infinite series e1/3 x ~ 2 + 2ss/9ee 24s4/243e4 + 308s6/6561e6 &c. in case that series is a converging one. Now, Second Case of the Cubick Equation x3 qx = r. 945 Now, since q3/27 is = 9261, and rr/4 is = 6561, we shall have q3/27 rr/4, or ss, = 2700, which is less than 6561, or ee, in the proportion of 100 to 243. Consequently the series 2 + 2ss/9ee 20s4/243e4 + 308s6/6461e6 &c. and the product of that series multiplied into e1/3, or the series e1/3 x 2 + 2ss/9ee 20s4/243e4 + 308s6/6561e6 &c. will converge. Therefore the equation x3 63x = 162 may be resolved by it as follows. 48. Since ss is = 2700, and rr/4, or ee, is = 6561, we shall have ss/ee = 2700/6561 = 100/243 =.411,522, and s4/e4 =.169,350, and s6/e6 =.069,691, and consequently 2ss/9ee = 2 x.411,522/9 =.823,044/9 = .091,449, and 20s4/243e4 = 20 x.169,350/243 = 3.387,0/243 =.013,938, and 308s6/6561e6 = 308 x.069,691/6561 = 21.464,828/6561 =.003,271. Therefore 2 + 2ss/9ee 20s4/243e4 + 308s6/6561e6 &c. is = 2 +.091,449, -.013,938, + .003,271 &c. = 2.094,720, -.013,938 &c. = 2.080,782, &c. And e1/3, or ~ 3 ~ e, is = ~ 3 ~ 81 = 4.326,749. Therefore e1/3 x the series 2 + 2ss/9ee 20s4/243e4 + 308s6/6561e6 &c. is = 4.326,749 x 2.080,782, &c. = 9.003,021 &c; that is, the root of the proposed equation x3 63x = 162 is = 9.003,021, &c. or somewhat less than 9.003,021; which is true to three places V O L. LXVIII. 6 B of 946 Extension of Cardan's Rule to the of figures, the error being in the fourth place of figures, or the third place of decimal fractions, where there ought to be a cypher instead of a 3, because the accurate value of x in this equation is 9, as will appear upon trial: for, if x be taken = 9, we shall have x3= 729, and 63x=567, and consequently x3-63x (=729 -567)=162. S C H O L I U M. 49. This resolution of the equation x3-63x=162 answers to Dr. WALLIS'S resolution of it by extracting the cube-roots of the impossible binomial quantities 81+~-2700 and 81-~-2700, inasmuch as both resolutions are originally derived from CARDAN'S rule. But the difference between them is, that the method here delivered is intelligible in every step of it, whereas Dr. WALLIS'S method treats of impossible quantities, or quantities of which no clear idea can be formed, in the whole course of the process, though it concludes with a result that is intelligible, by means of the equality of the impossible members of the two ultimate quantities 9/2+1/2~-3 and 9/2-1/2~-3 (whose sum is equal to the value of x), and the contrariety of the signs + and -, which are prefixed to them. The doctor's method of finding 9/2+1/2~-3 and 9/2-1/2~-3 to be the cube-roots 2 of Second Case of the Cubick Equation x3-qx=r. 947 of the impossible binomial quantities 81+~-2700 and 81-~-2700 is only tentative. But Mr. DE MOIVRE has given a certain method of finding the cube-roots of such quantities in all cases; but not without the trisection of an angle, or finding (by the help of a table of sines, or otherwise) the cosine of the third part of a circular arc whose cosine is given; by means of which trisection it is well known (independently of CARDAN'S rule, or Mr. DE MOIVRE'S process) that the second case of the cubick equation x3-qx=r (in which rr/4 is less than q3/27, may be resolved. So that Mr. DE MOIVRE'S method of doing this business, though more perfect than Dr. WALLIS'S, does not seem to be of much use in the resolution of these equations. And both methods are equally liable to the objection above-mentioned, of exhibiting to our eyes, during the whole course of the processes, a parcel of algebraick quantities, of which our understandings cannot form any idea; though, by means of the ultimate exclusion of those quantities, the results become intelligible and true. It is by the introduction of such needless difficulties and mysteries into algebra (which, for the most part, take their rise from the supposition of the existence of negative quantities, 6 B 2 or 948 Extension of Cardan's Rule to the or quantities less than nothing, or of the possibility of subtracting a greater quantity from a lesser), that the otherwise clear and elegant science of algebra has been clouded and obscured, and rendered disgusting to numbers of men of a just taste for reasoning; who are apt to complain of it, and despise it, on that account. And, doubtless, they have too much reason to do so, and to say, in the words of the famous Monsieur DES CARTES in his dissertation De Methodo, page II, Algebram vero, ut solet doceri, animadverti certis regulis et numerandi formulis ita esse contentam, ut videatur potius ars quaedam confusa, cujus usu ingenium quodammodo turbatur et obscuratur, quam scientia, qua excolatur et perspicacius reddatur. If this complaint was just in DES CARTES'S time, there is certainly much more reason for it now. 50. The passage above alluded to in Dr. WALLIS'S algebra, is in the 48th chapter, pages 179, 180, of the folio edition at London in 1685. And Mr. DE MOIVRE'S method of extracting the cube-root of an impossible binomial quantity, as 81 + ~ 2700, or a + ~ b, is published in the appendix to the second volume of professor SAUNDERSON'S algebra, pages 744, 745, 746, 747. It is very ingenious, and shews that author's great skill in the use and management of algebraick Second Case of the Cubick Equation x3-qx=r. 949 gebraick quantities.
