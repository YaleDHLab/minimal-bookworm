LXVIII. Extract of a Letter from Mons. Bonnet, F. R. S. to Mr. Trembley, F. R.S. dated at Geneva, 30 January 1756, concerning the Earthquake on the 14th of November, 1755, in Valais in Swisserland. Translated from the French. VALAIS is thought to have been more shaken by the earthquake than our city and its neighbourhood. I procured a letter to be written to Brigue for a particular account of it. The following is an extract of the answer of a merchant of that town, to whom the letter was addressed. I should have been glad to have had some information concerning Brigue itself, which is said to have suffered considerably; but you will find, that this merchant says not a word of it. I shall make a fresh inquiry. Read Feb. 19, 1756. T H E earthquake felt here, happened on the 14th of November, at three in the afternoon. It proceeded from the North, and lasted a minute. The earth opened on the mountain; and the openT t t 2 ing Brigue, January 26, 1756. [512] ing <inferred>was</inferred> large enough to thrust one's hand in, and no bottom can be found. In another part of the mountain the earthquake opened a spring sufficient to turn two mills. It continues to run near the Rhone. It is remarkable, that before the earthquake there was no source of water in that place. The earth has been opened in another place. The opening is round, and no bottom can be discovered. The earth continues to shake almost every day, but these shocks are much gentler than the first. People here are under extreme apprehensions. Most of the inhabitants are retired into the mountains, where they lodge in wooden houses, which are safer than those in the city.
