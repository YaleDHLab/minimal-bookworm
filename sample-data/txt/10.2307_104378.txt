The Perihelion of the Comet's Orbit was within the Sphere of the Orbit of Venus, and without that of the Orbit of Mercury; being distant from the Sun 0,69614 Parts of the Earth's mean Distance from the Sun. The Plane of the Orbit stood inclined to the Plane of the Ecliptic in an Angle of 53~. 25~. The Diurnal mean Motion, according as it is interpretted by Dr. Halley in his Elements of cometical Astronomy, was 1~,5707. XVI. A
