By vicissitude is meant the greatest rise or fall of the quicksilver in the smallest number of days. S. FARR. Dr. [195] Dr. FARR had also given the mean heights of the thermometer within doors for every month in the year. But these are omitted, because observations of the thermometer in the house are of no importance, unless accompanied with corresponding oncs of an instrument kept in the shade in the open air. The air of a room, though kept without a fire, and so situated as never to see the Sun, alters its degree of heat or cold so much more slowly than the external air, that no judgement can be formed of the temperature of the one from that of the other: except after a continuance of weather of the same kind for a long time together, their mutual relation is vague and undetermined. Dr. FARR likewise sent a particular account of the winds and changes of the weather for every day of the year; from which I have composed the two following tables. S. HORSLEY.

The same is to be understood in the tables, p. 177. p. 193. [198] This table distinguishes the changes of weather which fell on the days of true syzygie, true quadrature, and true octagonal aspect. Setting aside the very changeable months of September and November, there were 39 changes in the remaining 10, fourteen of which happened upon the days specified; which is almost 4 more than belong to them on the even chance. Of these 14 changes, only four fell upon the day of a new moon, and none at all upon the day of the full. XVIII. Ex
