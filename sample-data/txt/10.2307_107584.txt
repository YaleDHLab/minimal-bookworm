XVII. Note respecting the demonstration of the binomial theorem inserted in the last volume of the Philosophical Transactions. By Thomas Knight, Esq. Communicated by Taylor Combe, Esq. Sec. R. S. Read April 17, 1817. I N looking into Mr.: SPENCE'S ingenious "ct Essay on Logarithmic Transcendents," a work published in 809, but which I have been so unfortunate as never to have seen till within the last fortnight, I was not a little surprised to find that a demonstration of the binomial theorem, similar to the one-I had the honour to 'present to the Royal Society, had been already given by that writer. The same may be said of the first proposition of the preceding Paper on the construction of Logarithms . Having made this acknowledgment, I shall perhaps be pardoned for observing, that Mr. SPENCE is not particularly happy in the manner of developing the kind of functions he treats of in his preface. I shalt endeavour to give the solution of a class of equations of which he (Pref. p. vii.) has considered a particular case: with this we will begin. It is proposed to develope the function which has this property, viz. + +q(i+y.1+Y)-c(1+X.1+y ). Assume p( 1+x)-A+A'x+A"'x*+A"/ v+..t..A " . and after making the requisite substitutions in the given 246 Mr; KNIGHT'S note respecting the demonstration, &(. equation, we see immediately that A=o, and that A' and A" are arbitrary. Then, to find the law of the coefficients, in this and other similar cases, where there are any number of independent quantities, xi, x', ' . x" ,no transpose all the equation to one side, and find the coefficient of the first power of x"** , then the coefficient of the first power of x" en-X in the former coefficient, then again, in this last, the coefficient of the first power of X ".n-,2: and having arrived in this manner at the coefficient of art, it will have the form a+bx+ -cx2 + + rx 4.+, and the equation r-o will give the law sought for. In the present case, putting p = x + ( 1 + x )z, r = o + x + (I +x)z, we find, by equalling to o the coefficient of the first power of y, 0--A/+2A/ 1 +sA'" 1 + .+(n+1)A'i.,.(n+') 4.

Of the binomial theorem. 247 (1 +X) ) +A" x_( X3 5X+X) .3 2.3..*4. 6 nothing can be easier than to find the value of the remaining series; for it is quite obvious, from the equation expressing the property of the function, that L( 1+x) is a particular value of p( i+x). The same also appears from equation (i), i' which, if we putA... (nt-z)= _ A". .(n-i) i A' ..A X the left hand member vanishes.

Then to have the law of the coefficients, find, according to the rule, the coefficient of a in the coefficient of z in the coefficient of y, and, comparing in this the coefficients of the powers of w, we find MDcCCXv11.

As, however, this result has been obtained by the inspection of only a few terms of two series, a doubt may be entertained with respect to its truth: make therefore w=x= y=z, in equation (s), it will become 4P(i+x)=6q( i+x)2 --.-+4( i+x)3 + cplI~xY, which by the substitution of the of the binomial theorem. 249 value found above for p( i+x) is found to be identical, and the truth of the solution is proved. We may now attempt the solution of the general problem viz. Let x, XI, .v", X"/', . ... x*'P be independent quantities; it is required to find p( i+x) from the following equation, * .qt(1 +i , 1 ..j"~. 1 ti***t. i+XU '$).~(1 +e" m 1 + 1+X;Jr. I+X "s1+?7 *t) + &c, Assume as usual (i +x) A + A'x+ A"x2+A"'x3+ but instead of attempting to find the law of the coefficients, we may easily convince ourselves that 0 (i+x) will have the fobl. lowing form, viz. p(i +x)=A' {L (i + x) + ll (I + x) + 'VL3(t + *) + "" L4(i+x)+ . + LU (i +x} +A"{ L3(i +x)+ IIIIL4(1+ X)+. * -t+rytLP(1 +x) } h~~~~~ * * * S * * ** This form evidently includes, as particular solutions, L(i +x), LV(1 +x), L3( i tx ) . * * * * * LP ( I +Xa) .and, by means of these particular solutions, we are enabled to find the coefficients all, cfP' fi", &c.

So much for the expansion of these functions. W~hat Mr. SPENCE means by the note in page ix. of his Preface, where he speaks of the integralfj (z) an equation which is evidently impossible, I am unable to form the smallest conjecture.
