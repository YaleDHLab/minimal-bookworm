Fig. 1. Dr. Hans Sloaue first sent a Specimen of this (then rare) Plant to Mr Ray, which he describes in his History. It differs from the common Polypody, in having its Alae or Wings deeply jagged or torn: I never yet observed any Seed on this Fern. Mr. Jacob Bobart, Botanick Professor at Oxford, gives a very lively Figure of this elegant Plant, which he says was first discover'd A. D. 1668. by Richard Kayse of Bristol, on a Rock, in a Wood near Dennis Powis Castle by Caerdiff in Glamorganshire. 2 Names. Distinction. Discovery and Place. Orton Flowring Fern, or Small Osmund.

Mr John Ray, that Patron of Botany, first observed this in England, about the Parish of Orton, where it grows plentifully, and in other places in Westmoreland. Mr Edward Lhwyd hath also found it on Snowdon Hill in North Wales. Mr John Robinson, alias Fitz. Roberts, a Curious Naturalist, sent up several of these Plants from Kendal, which were set in Chelsea Garden and elsewhere, but after a Winter or two, they often go off. 3 Names.

This rare Plant Mr John Parkinson, that accurate Botanist and Apothecury in his Theatrum Botanicum tells you, was found about 80 Years ago on a Mountain in Wales, by Mr. Moris Lloyd of Prislierworth, and about 20 Years since it hath been again observed by his Namesake, that celebrated and known Naturalist Mr Edward Lhwyd, on the Mountains Snowdon and Caderidris; and soon after by Mr Tho. Lawson and Mr John Fitz-Roberts, two other expert Botanists, in Westmorland, where the Curious Dr. Richard Richardson tells me he has also found it, as well as in 5 Names. Where and by who <inferred>first</inferred> discover'd in England Wales, (378) Wales, but not as yet in Yorkshire, where he lives, Mr Patrick Blair, a Curious Botanist and Anatomist, hath observed it in divers places in Scotland.

Dr. Sherard hath found it nearer home, viz, in the Isle of Jersey on dry Banks and Walls very common. 6 Names. Places. Common Yellow Oxe-eye. English Herbal, Tab.19. Fig. 7. Ray Hist. Hist. 341. 9.

Hieracium medio nigrum Baeticum majus. Park 792. 6. Hieracium medio nigrum, fl: majore Jonst. 1625. The peculiarity of this Plant is to have a bearded Head, with Brimstone Flowers and black in the middle. This pretty Hawkweed was first brought into our English Gardens about the Year 1620 from Spain by Mr William Boel, a Fleming, who communicated the Seeds of this and several other Spanish and Portugueze Plants to Mr. Coys, Goodyer, Jonston, and Parkinson, all eminent Botanists in those Days. 16 Names. Character. Hoary Buckshorn Chamomil. Chamaemelum Coronopi folio tomentoso. The largest of these Leaves resemble our Wart or Swines Cress, but are very hoary; its a low Plant with hollow Stalks,especially when dry. TheFlowers of the size and shape of the Single Sweet Chamomil the Branches leafy, but the Flowers when full grown, stand on Stalks void of Leaves two and sometimes three Inches bare. Chelsea Physick Garden is obliged to Mr JaH h h cob 17 Described (382) cob Bobart, Botanick Professor of Oxford, for this elegant Plant, and divers others he has been pleased to send thither.

This Icon seems to be taken from a shriveled Specimen, which the Author found on the Mountains of Norcia. Mr Bobarts Figure which Dr. Plukenet copied, very well resembles this Plant, which from a stringy Root rarely rises a foot high; its two lower Leaves resemble our great Stone Basill (or Clinopodium majus) with four more at the top; in the midst of these stand a tuft of purplish Flowers, set in long pipey husks, rough or hairy as is the whole Plant. The Learned Dr. Huntington first sent this elegant Plant from Aleppo to Oxford, from whence our Physick Garden has been adorned with it. 21 Names. Form. Purple, long-leav'd Arch-angel. Ray 559. 2.

The Leaves are broad and long like our great Stitchwort, and those about the Flower are hairy edg'd, by which and the specious largeness of its Flowers, it differs from the rest.

(385) in Thrace, and brought Seeds of it over, which he gave to Mr Peter Dent, an Eminent Apothecary and Botanist in the University, who communicated the same to Mr Ray, who raised the Plant, as we have lately done at Chelsey Garden, where it makes a beautiful Show.

That most accurate Botanist Fabius Columna, is the only one who has given us a Figure of this Plant, which he has done to the nicest Perfection, both in the Leaves, Flowers, and the natural twisting of its Bills. The lower Leaves are not unlike the jagged Celandine, and those on the Stalks are much more deeper cut. It grows about Mompelier in Ditches and Borders of Fields, as also in Italy, where the Curious Columna first observed it. 47 N. B. Leaves. Place. Tall (391) Tall Roman Catch-Fly. Ray H. Pl.

It grows in the Clifts about the Convent of the Brutin Carthusians, call'd St. Bartholomco di Trisulti, where it was not long since discovered by John Baptist Triumfetti, Reader and Super Intendant of the Physick Garden at Rome. I have observed this elegant Plant in Chelsey Garden, where it Flowers and Seeds from July till Autumn. 48 Name. Description. Place. Time. Candy Plantain, Ray H. Pl. 881. 13.

Parkinson, that accurate and knowing Botanist, is of the Opinion that all Clusius his Figures are only differing states of the same Plant, which I am also inclined to believe, not only of his, but also those of Alpinus, Bauhine, and Imperatus, which are all different both from Clusius and one another, which may arise from a peculiarity it has, especially in dry Seasons, to shrink or send its Head towards its Root, the Flower Stalks being short and extream woolly; for which reason I look upon Rawolfs Plantain, which the Hist. Lugd. app. 21. FiI i i 2 gures 49 Names. N. B. (392) gures under the Name of Planta rara Plantagini longe similis, (which some would have the same with this) to be another Plant, it rather resembling the Plantago angustifolia, paniculis Lagopi C.

This long-lost Herb I found in her Grace the Dutchess of Beaufort's Garden at Chelsey, whose Nursing Care scarce any Plant (tho' from the most distant Climates) can withstand.

This rare Plant I saw in Flower, with the Dutchess of Beaufort at Chelsey. Rawolph first found this in Syria, who travelled into those Parts about the Year 1573. Since that, Augerius Clutius observed it at Malaga, and William Boel about Cales. I have also had it from both these Parts of Spain.
