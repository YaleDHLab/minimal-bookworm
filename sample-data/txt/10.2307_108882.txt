E 733 1 XIX. On the Diifferential -Equations which determine the form of the Boots of Algebraic Equ~ations. By GEORGE BOOLE, F.B.S., Professor of Mathematics in Queen's College, Cork. Received April 27,-Read May 26, 1864. 1. Mr. HARLEY* has shown that any root of the equation yn-nzy+(n-l)x=0 satisfies the differential equation (D-fl1) (D-l)2) . D. (D-n ) e'1f-O (1 ) in which e0=x, and D provided that n be a positive integer greater than 2. This result, demonstrated for particular values of n, and raised by induction into a general theorem, was subsequently established rigorously by Mr. CAYLEY by means of LAGRANGE'S theorem. For the case of n=2, the differential equation was found by Mr. HARLEY to be D--2& e0y= lel. (2) Solving these differential equations for the particular cases of n=2 and n=3, Mr. HARLEY arrived at the actual expression of the roots of the given algebraic equation for these cases. That all algebraic equations up to the fifth degree can be reduced to the above trinomial form, is well known. A solution of (1) by means of definite triple integrals in the case of n=-4 has been published by Mr. W. H. L. RUSSELL; and I am informed that a general solution of the equation by means of a definite single integral has been obtained by the same analyst. While the subject seems to be more important with relation to differential than with reference to algebraic equations, the connexion into which the two subjects are brought must itself be considered as a very interesting fact. As respects the former of these subjects, it may be observed that it is a matter of quite fundamental importance to ascertain for what forms of the function p (D), equations of the type u + p(D)et~t= 0 .(3) admit of finite solution. We possess theorems which enable us to deduce from each known integrable form an infinite number of others. Yet there is every reason to think* Proceedings of the Literary and Philosophical Society of Manchester, No. 12, Session 1861-62.5 E 2 734 PROFESSOR BOOLE ON THE DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS WHICH that the number of really primary forms-of forms the knowledge of which, in combination with such known theorems, would enable us to solve all equations of the above type that are finitely solvable-is extremely small. It will, indeed, be a most remarkable conclusion, should it ultimately prove that the forms in question stand in -absolute and exclusive connexion with the class of algebraic equations here considered. The following paper is a contribution to the general, theory under the aspect last mentioned. In endeavouring to solve Mr. HARLEY'S equation by definite integrals, I was led to perceive its relation to a more general equation, and to make this the subject of investigation. The results will be presented in the following order:First, I shall show that if 'a stand for the mth power of any root of the algebraic equation ye _Xyn 1 1 =0O then u, considered as a function of x, will satisfy the differential equation in l 4 D mi ) [D]n'a+ D+ in which e0=x, D= d and the notation dO 1aubba(a-1)(a -2 ) . (a-b + ) is adopted. Secondly, I shall show that for particular values of m, the above equation admits of an immediate first integral, constituting a differential equation of the n-1th order, and that the results obtained by Mr. HARLEY are particular cases of this depressed equation, their difference of form arising from difference of determination of the arbitrary constant. Thirdly, I shall solve the general differential equation by definite integrals. Fourthly, I shall determine the arbitrary constants of the solution so as to express the mth power of that real root of the proposed algebraic equation which reduces to 1 when x=O. The differential equation which forms the chief subject of these investigations certainly occupies an important place, if not one of exclusive importance, in the theory of that large class of differential equations of which the type is expressed in (3). At present, I am not aware of the existence of any differential equations of that particular type which admit of finite solution at all, otherwise than by an ultimate reduction to the form in question, or by a resolution into linear equations of the first order. It constitutes, in fact, a generalization of the form + a(J-(2) 2* e29n 0 DL(Di)eu= given in my memoir " On a General Method in Analysis " (Philosophical Transactions for 1844, Part II.).

In particular, 736 PROFESSOR BOOLE ON THE DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS WHICH if we give to 1W the particular value 1, we have rm[m+ (a1)r LgrUor= nLr]r and the expansion then represents the mth power of that particular root which, when = 0, reduces to 1.

As u may here represent the mth power of any of the roots of the given equation, it is evident that the general integral of the above differential equation will be Cy +C22 *. +c n .(7) exception arising, however, in the case in which for a particular value of m the n particular integrals ym, ym, . y cease to be independent. In such cases the above value of u constitutes an integral, but not the general integral of the differential equation. For instance, if Mn= -1, and if we reduce the given algebraic equation to the form 1y)n +Xy-1_I= 0 it is evident that, except when n= 2, we shall have ly -1 +,Y-1 +,Yn 1 = O. Here then U=C yij+C2,Y/1* .+Cnyn may be reduced to the form Cq6 =(C1-n~1+ (C2-Cn)Y2 * Cn)Yn-1 virtually involving but n-1 arbitrary constants. Such cases of failure may, however, be treated by giving to the integral a form which for the particular value of rn shall become indeterminate, and then seeking the limiting DETERMINE THE FORM OF THE ROOTS OF ALGEBRAIC EQUATIONS. :737 value. In the above example we may write a=3.* + Cn-l~E ,+ ~+Yr + Ym + 7?, the last term of which becomes a vanishing fraction when m= _1. The; true limiting form is seen to be u-CIyj* +Cn-1Yn1+Cn(Yl logy01.. +y; logy"). . * * (8) This is the complete integral of (I.) when m= 14. The theory of these failing cases may be viewed also in another aspect. When QY. + C2Y.2 *+ .n .(9) is an integral, but not the general integral of the differential equation (I), it must be the general integral of a differential equation involved in (I), but of a lower order. We may in fact conclude that such reduced differential equation will be deducible from the higher one by a process of integration. Let us apply this consideration to the foregoing example. When m= 1, the equation (I) becomes D(D-1).. (D -+I)u+ n{ D-5 ] (D-n+ 1)enu-. Hence operating on both members with (D-n+1)', we have D(D-1). * (D-n+2)1z+l[ D-l] = C It must then be possible to determine C0 so as to cause this differential equation to be satisfied by (9). First let us seek to determine C so as to cause the equation to admit of any of the particular integrals yr, yi, . . y. Substituting for u the Lagrangian expansion reduced -by making m= 1, and giving to b any of the particular values included in the form 1, we shall, on equating coefficients, find whence it appearsthat if X be greater than 2, 0=O. Thus the reduced differential equation becomes [D] 1-lt + D-'-1 etlu-0 .................. (10)_ and this, when n is greater than 2, is satisfied by U-C1Yl l +Q2YV 1 *+Cnynwhich in effect contains n-I arbitrary constants, and so constitutes the complete mitegral of the differential equation.

Jn this case, in fact, the condition yT'+y;1=O not being fulfilled, the primary differential equation (I) suffers no change in the form of its general solution. Mr. HARLEY'S results are in effect transformations of (10) and (11). Since U=-=c, it is seen that u will satisfy the algebraic equation u7+xu-1=0.

Not only for the particular value m= -1, but apparently for all integer values ofnm,? the general differential equation (I) admits of one integration.. It may be said that while the differential equation determining the form of the mth power of a root of the algebraic equation is in general of the nth order, this equation may, when m is an integer, be reduced to an' equation) of the n-lth order; not, however, like the higher equation, DETERMINE THE FORM OF TiE ROOTS OF ALGEBRAIC EQUATIONS. 739 unvarying in its type.

We are justified in doing this by the canons relating to the arbitrary constants which are laid down in the memoir; but it will suffice here to direct attention to the fact that while the processes employed are strictly speaking particular, they lead to a solution involving the requisite number of arbitrary constants, and at the same time of the properform, as manifested by the succession of the indices in its development.

All these terms vanish when v=O since, by the conditions to which m is subject, m+(n-l)r is positive. Again, they vanish when v is made infinite, since in this case Avmn+(n-l)rAvMr (1 + Vn)2 and, by the conditions relative to ni, the index m-r is negative.

Hence, the lowest value of r in the expansion of the definite integral being unity, we see that the value of that integral will be expressed by 7(yml), as was to be shown. It will be observed that the function under the sign of definite integration does not become infinite within the limits. Ordinary methods of approximation might therefore be applied. I apprehend, however, that it is not in this direction that the value of such results is to be sought. MIDCC~lXIV. 5nHi
