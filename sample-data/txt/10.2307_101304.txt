A Suggestion For taking more notice, than hath been done formerly, of the Juyces of Trees, by tapping them. ALthough some have been Curious in taking notice and making use of the Liquors of some Trees by tapping them, yet is there much wanting in this kind of Observations and Tryals, (802) als, in regard there have been upon this account but very few Trees examin'd, comparatively to those, that are yet left unconsider'd and untry'd. The Publisher therefore, being lately discours'd with upon this subject, and told, how great an addition there might be made to this knowledge, and how beneficial that might prove both for the preservation and recovery of Mans health, (it being instanc'd to him, that one of the present Kings of Europe drinks much, and finds great benefit, of the juyce of Walnut-trees;) thought himself obliged to recommend the enlargment of the said knowledge, by further Experiments, to all Ingenious and Industrious Men; as also to request them, that they would please to impart unto him for publick use, what they either already know, or shall hereafter discover and learn of that nature.
