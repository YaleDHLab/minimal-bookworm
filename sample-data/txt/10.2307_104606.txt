[54] XV. A State of the English Weights and Measures of Capacity, as they appear from the Laws as well ancient as modern; with some Considerations thereon; being an Attempt to prove that the present Avoirdepois Weight is the legal and ancient Standard for the Weights and Measures of this Kingdom; by Samuel Reynardson Esq; F. R. S. IT is declared by (1) Magna Charta that there should be, throughout the Realm, one Measure of Wine (2), one of Ale, and one of Corn; viz. the Quarter (3) of London; and that it should be of Weights as of Measures. This Declaration has been repeated in many subsequent Laws (4), and by several of them the Treasurer is directed to provide Standards of Bushels, Gallons, (1) c. 25. (2) Bishop Fleetwood says, it was a good Law of king Edgar, that there should be the same Weight and the same Measures throughout the Realm, but it was never well observed. Chron. pretiosum, p. 34. And, 2 Inst. p. 41. says, This Law was grounded upon the Law of God, Deut. xxv. ver. 13, 14. and that there were good Laws for Weights and Measures made before the Conquest by Canute. See Custum. de Norm. c. 16. (3) See p. 64. of this Transact. the Contents of a Quarter. (4) 51 H. III. St. 6. 14. 25, and 27. Ed. III. 13, 15, and 16 R. II. 9 H. VI. 11 H. VII. c. 4. 16 Car.

[55] Gallons, and Weights, of Brass; and to send them into every County; and all Measures are to be made according to the King's Standard; the Assize whereof is established by several Laws (1), as follows: ` The ` English Peny, called a Sterling round, without ` clipping, to weigh 32 Grains of Wheat dry, and ` taken from the midst of the Ear. 20 Pence make ` an Ounce. 12 Ounces a Pound. 8 Pounds make ` a Gallon of Wine (2). 8 Gallons of Wine make ` a London Bushel (3), which is the eighth Part of a ` a Quarter.' And by other Laws (4) it is declared, ` That the Tun of Wine, Oil, and Honey, should ` contain, of the English Measure, according to the ` antient Assize, 252 Gallons; the Pipe or Butt 126; ` The Tertian 84; the Hogshead 63; and every Bar` rel 311/2, according to the old Assize, and to be ` gaged by the King's Gager.' In the Reign of Edward III. (5) an Act passed to take away the Weight called Ancell (6), whereby, and by subsequent Statutes, it is directed, that every Sale and Buying should by the even Balance.

Complaint being made to the Parliament, that the ancient Statutes and Ordinances of the Realm relating to Weights and Measures had not been observed and kept, it was therefore Enacted, ` That there should be deli` vered to the Knights and Citizens of every Shire ` and City, one of every Weight and Measure, which ` the King had caused to be made of Brass, accord` ing to his Standard in the Exchequer, to be deli` vered to the respective Places mentioned in the Act; ` and that the Inhabitants of all Cities, Boroughs, ` and Market-Towns, should make and use Weights ` and Measures made according to the Weights and ` Measures so delivered as aforesaid.'' In the next Year another Act passed, reciting, ` That the King ` had made such Weights and Measures of Brass, ac` cording to the old Standard thereof remaining within ` his Treasury; which Weights and Measures, upon ` more diligent Examination, had been approved ` defective, and not made according to the Statutes ` and old Laws, and were therefore recalled, and ` ordered to be broken, and other new Bushels and ` Gallons were directed to be made and sised, ac` cording to a new Bushel and Gallon to be made ` according to the Assize, to remain in the King's ` Exchequer:' Where we now find a Bushel in the Custody of the Chamberlains called the Winchester Bushel (1), and a Gallon agreeing thereto: Upon the Bushel (1) The first time I find it so called by any Law, is in an Act 22 C. II. c. 8.: And afterwards it is called by this Name in several Acts of Parliament; but in the Act just now mentioned, it is said [57] Bushel there is the following Inscription; Henericus septimus Dei gratia Rex Angliae et Franciae. In the last-mention'd Act, the Assise for Weights and Measures is in Substance the same as in the old Statutes, only the Pound is said to be the Pound Troy of 12 Ounces. But since by this and the former Assise Laws the Pound is directed to be raised from 240 Sterling Penies, it follows, that the Gravity of the Assise Pound was always the same; but the Dimensions of Measures of Capacity respectively raised from a Pound of Wine, and a Pound of Wheat, will be in proportion to each other as the specific Gravity of Wheat to that of Wine or Water. Thus continued the Laws relating to the English Standard of Weights and Measures till after the Restauration; when a Duty of Excise (2) being laid upon Beer, Ale, and other Liquors, 36 Gallons taken by the Gage, according to the Standard of the Ale-Quart, (4 whereof made the Gallon remaining in the Exchequer) were to be reckoned as a Barrel of Beer, and 32 <inferred>such</inferred> Gallons a Barrel of Ale; and afterwards (3) 34 such Gallons of Vinegar (and of Beer or Ale stronger or small without the Bills of Mortality) were declared to be a Barrel; and all other Liquors liable to said to be commonly called the Winchester Measure. Perhaps it first took that Name from the Statute made at Winchester 16 R. II. which directs the Clerk of the Market to have all his Weights and Measures ready, and marked and signed according to the Standard of the Exchequer. (2) 12 C. II. c. 24. ~ 20. (3) 1 W. and M. c. 24. ~ 5. 10 W. III. c. 21. 11 and 12 ditto, c. 15. H [58] to the Excise-Duty were to pay according to the Wine Gallon. We now find the Officers of the Revenue determining the Contents of our Measures of Capacity with great Exactness: For, on the 25th of May 1688, two general Officers of the Excise, in the Presence of the Lord-Mayor, the Commissioners of Excise, Mr. Flamstead, and others, upon an exact Trial found that the old Standard Wine Gallon, kept in Guildhall, did contain but 224 cubic Inches; nevertheless, at that time it was thought convenient to continue the former supposed Content, being 231 cubic Inches, as the Standard Wine Gallon, and which has since been established by a Law (1). In the Year 1696, an Experiment was made, in order to fix the true and exact Contents of the Brass Standard Bushel of Henry VII. which being filled with common Spring-Water, and the Water measured out with great Nicety and Exactness; the Bushel (2) was found to contain 2145,6 solid or cubic Inches; and the Water being weighed by the Standard Weights in the Exchequer (and by a Beam, which would turn with six Grains put into either Scale, with 30 Pounds in each Scale) was found equal to 1131 Ounces 14 Penyweights Troy; and at the same Time and Place the Standard Troy Weights were compared with the Standard Avoirdepois, and 15 Pounds (1) 5 Ann. c. 27. ~ 17. This Act says, Any Cylinder 7 Inches Diameter, and 6 Inches deep, or any Vessel containing 231 cubical Inches, and no more, shall be a lawful Wine-Gallon. (2) Everard's Stereometry, p. 193. [59] Pounds of the latter were found equal to 18 Pounds 2 Ounces 15 Penyweights Troy; which fixes the Pound Avoirdepois at 7000 (1) such Grains, as the Troy Pound weighs 5760; and upon three several Trials, made by the Gentlemen of the Council of the Royal Society, at the Exchequer, upon a Medium the Avoirdepois Pound was found equal to 7000,25 Troy Grains. By the first (2) Malt Act, which passed soon after the making the Experiment upon the Winchester Bushel, it is declared, that every Bushel 18 Inches and 1/2 wide, and 8 Inches deep, should be esteemed a legal Winchester Bushel: And the Coal Bushel is directed (3) to be made 19 Inches and 1/2 Diameter, and to contain the last Bushel and one Quart of Water. The first contains 2150,42 cubic Inches, the last 2217,47. We now see different Measures established by Law (4); and under the Excise Laws, two different Gages or Measures, used for taking the Dimensions of Wine and Ale Vessels. The Wine Gallon contains 231 cubic Inches, and the Ale Gallon 282; but upon what Foundation this last Measure was established is difficult to determine. Troy (1) Ward, in his Young Math. Guide, says, 69991/2 Grains. Phil. Trans. No. 465. p. 181. and No. 470. Bishop Hooper 10. Pharmacopaeia Londin. says, The Avoirdepois Pound is said to be about 7000 Grains. (2) 13 IV. III. c. 5. ~ 28. and 1 Ann. St. 2. c. 3. ~ 10. (3) 12 Ann. St. 2. c. 17. ~ 11. (4) Though contrary to Magna Charta, and several other Laws not repealed. H 2 [60] Troy Weights had for some time been established and used for the Money Affairs in the Mint, and for weighing Gold, Silver, and some few Commodities; and the Avoirdepois were in general Use for weighing all heavy and gross Commodities. Wine Measure was generally look'd upon as equal to Troy Weight: From hence the Managers of the Excise Duty were perhaps led to fix the Standard of the Ale Gallon, bearing the same Proportion to the Wine Gallon as the Avoirdepois Pound did to the Troy; and according to this Conjecture, the two Gallons answer pretty exactly (1); the Ale Gallon exceeding the Proportion by somewhat more than one cubic Inch and one Quarter; but it exceeds the Winchester Gallon, or 268,2 cubic Inches by very near 14 cubic Inches: And not one of these Measures is agreeable to the Words of the Assise, which directs, (2) ` That the Bushel shall contain 8 Gallons of Wheat, ` the Gallon 8 Pound of Wheat of Troy Weight, ` the Pound 12 Ounces of Troy Weight,' &c. according to the old Laws of this Land. It is very plain the Law makers in Henry the VIIth's Time took the Troy Weight for the Standard; and most Authors who have wrote upon this Subject have follow'd their Example. The great Difficulty we are under in fixing upon a Standard Pound, agreeable to the Assise, arises from the Uncertainty of the Rule laid down in our Laws of (1) For, as 144: 175:: 231: 280, 729 And as 144: 175:: 224: 272, 222. This last comes very near the vulgar dry Gallon. (2) 12 H. VII. c. 5. [61] of Assise for raising the Pound from 7680 Grains of Wheat; as these Grains differ in Weight, in different Countries, and in different Years, I might have said in the same Field, and in the same Year. The Uncertainty of a Pound so raised might with great Probability occasion the Variety in our Weights and Measures, so often complained of in our ancient Laws, and for the Prevention whereof Edward III. in his 14th Year, ordered ` Standard Weights and ` Measures to be made of Brass, and sent into every ` City and Town in the Kingdom.' The Laws of Assise never received any Alteration, except by the 12th of Hen. VII. when the Pound is declared to contain 12 Ounces of (1) Troy Weight, and the Gallon 8 Pounds of Wheat of Troy Weight; and since the Laws have received no Change, we have great Reason to conclude, that the Standard Weights themselves never suffer'd any Addition or Diminution; but however this be, we (2) now find in the Custody of the proper Officer of the Exchequer, (1) This is the first time the Standard Weights are called Troy Weights. But in an Act 2 H. V. St. 2. c. 4. and 2 H. VI. c. 13. relating to Goldsmiths, there is mention made of The Pound of Troy. (2) Phil. Trans. No. 470. The Avoirdepois Weight of 14 Pounds is marked with a crowned E. and inscribed XIIII POVNDE AVERDEPOIZ. ELIZABETH. REGINA. 1582. The Troy Weights marked with a crowned E. are Ounces, from 256 down to the 16th Part of an Ounce: And there are no whole Pounds Troy, Peny Weights, or Grain Weights, at the Exchequer. There not being Pounds, or greater Weights, seems to be a Proof that these Weights were never designed or used for determining the Weight of large Bodies, or heavy Goods. [62] quer 2 Setts of Weights, kept there as Standards; one called Troy, the other Avoirdepois Weight. As there is no Account handed down to us by our Ancestors, shewing at what time, and upon what Occasion, these Weights, differing considerably in Gravity from each other, were there first deposited, we are at a Loss to determine which is the ancient Standard Weight described by the Laws of Assise. The Act in the 12th of Hen. VII. has called the Standard Weight by the Name of Troy Weight; this is the first time the Weights are so called in any of our Assise Laws; and notwithstanding this Authority, it will be found very difficult, if not impossible, to reconcile the Troy Weight and Measure raised therefrom with the Words of the Assise, and any Measures now in being; for the natural and most ready Way to determine this Question is to compare both the Troy and Avoirdepois Weight with Measures raised from each, according to the Rule laid down in the Assise, and with such Measures as are or have been used by Authority. ` The most exact (1) and geometrical Way of ex` pressing the Capacity of any Vessel or Measure is ` by expressing in known Terms the Solidity of a ` Body which will precisely fill it: The fittest will ` be Water. The Solidity of all Bodies is best ex` pressed by the Help of a Cube, whose equal Sides ` we (1) Bishop Cumberland's Essay, p. 60. who also says, The Egyptians made their Ardob the Cube of their known Standard the Cubit: And that the Romans made their Quadrantal the Cube of their Standard the Foot. [63] ` we know by a Standard Measure of Length; and it ` appears, that this Way of determining Measures of ` Capacity is not only the most geometrical, but ` also exceeding ancient (2) '. By this Rule some Gentlemen at Oxford, in the Year 1685, determined the Weight of a cubic (3) Foot of Spring Water, or 1728 solid Inches, to be 1000 Ounces Avoirdepois; and by the same Rule the Capacity and Contents of the Standard Bushel in the Exchequer was determined in the Year 1696, with great Care and Exactness: By the same Rule the Contents of other Vessels of Capacity have been settled; and in the following Table p.71. I have inserted the Names of such Measures as are of any Authority, whose Contents are known; by which the Proportion they bear to each other, and to Measures raised according to the Assise, as well from the Pound Troy as the Pound Avoirdepois, will be readily observed. In the next place let us compare the Experiment made upon the cubic Foot of Spring Water with that upon the Winchester Bushel, and we shall find an uniform and perfect Agreement between them; and that, upon each Trial, a cubic Vessel, the Sides whereof were equal to an English Foot, did contain (4) 1000 Ounces Avoirdepois of Spring Water. From hence (2) Measures of Bodies are either determined by their solid Contents, or Weight. Measures of Content are formed from Cubes of assigned Lengths. Bishop Hooper, p. 2. (3) Phil. Trans. No. 169. oz. pw. Cu. In. cz. <inferred>Cu</inferred>. In. (4) For as 1131. 14 Troy: 2145,6:: 1000 Avoir.:: 1728,041. Some Writers upon this Subject say, that a cubic Foot of SpringWater [64] hence we are led to the Discovery of a natural and universal Standard for the English Weights and Measures; and such an one as is, in every respect, agreeable to the Words of the Assise recorded in our most ancient Laws. Magna Charta points out the Quarter of London as the only Standard for Measures and Weights of that time; but we are left to guess of what Measure or Weight it was the Quarter Part. If we suppose it the Quarter of a Ton, or 2000 Pound Weight, then the Quarter was 500 Pounds, and the eighth Part of that, or a Bushel, was equal to a cubic Foot, or 621/2 Pounds; from whence less Measures and Weights were easily deduced. Subsequent Assise Laws direct the greater Measures to be raised from the less; that 8 Pounds should make a Gallon; 8 Gallons a Bushel; which was to be the eighth Part of a Quarter; and by this Rule the Quarter is raised to 512 Pounds, and the Ton to 2048 Pounds. These Measures and Weights are raised with Ease from known Parts of the Foot. For a cubic Vessel, whose Sides are equal to 1/10 of a Foot, will contain a Cube of Spring Water equal to an Ounce Avoirdepois; and from hence, by a regular geometrical Progression, we shall obtain Cubes Water is equal to 76 Pounds Troy; which is 10 Penyweights 20 Grains more than the 1000 Avoirdepois. See Arbuthnot's Tables explain'd, p. 80, 283. Bishop Hooper's State, &c. p. 11. But the Explainer of Arbuthnot's Tables seems to have been quite ignorant of any Experiment since Sir Jonas Moore's Time; and to have disregarded the due Proportion between the Avoirdepois and Troy Pound; and for 175. to 144. his Tables, he says, are calculated at 17. to 14. [65] Cubes equal to (1) 8 64 512 Ounces, or to 4 32 256 2048 Pounds Avoirdepois: And from a cubic Vessel containing one such Pound, we shall have other cubic Vessels, equal in Weight 8 64 512 Pounds; and in Measure to the Gallon, Bushel and Quarter, according to the Assise. The (2) Gallon, Bushel, and Quarter, are called dry Measures; and are used for ascertaining the Quantity of Corn, and other dry Goods; the Gallon is also a liquid Measure raised from a Pound, in Liquids now called a Pint (3); from whence all the other liquid Measures are raised; but with this Difference in the Proportion, that the liquid Bushel is not 64, but 63 Pounds or Pints; eight whereof make the Hogshead equal to 63 Gallons; from whence the Contents, as well of the larger as smaller Vessels or Measures of Capacity are settled. The Measures of Capacity thus raised, are sufficiently convenient for common Use, and are generally retained at this time; but for Weights, there has been some Variety from time to time, in the Composition of the larger sort, used for determining the Weight of Merchandize and heavy Goods, as will appear from the following Extract from several old Acts (1) Eight Ounces are equal to a Mark, whereof two, or twice the Contents of that Cube make a Pound <inferred>Avoirdepois</inferred>. (2) The Half-Bushel, Peck, Gallon, Pottle, and Quart, are directed by 25 Ed. III. St. 5. c. 10. to be made according to the King's Standard. (a) See Bishop Hooper, p. 6. (3) <inferred>See</inferred> Note (5) of p. 66. infra. The Pint is not mention'd in the Assise Laws; but <inferred>Bishop</inferred> Hooper has given a long and learned Dissertation upon that Measure, and calls it the Pint of Old, p. 458. 1 [66] Acts of Parliament. The Stone for weighing Lead was (1) settled at 12 Pounds; for Wax, Sugar, Spices, and Allom, at 8 Pounds; of which last, 131/2, or 108 Pounds, made the hundred Weight: The Sack of Wool (2) was to weight but 26 Stone, 14 Pounds to each Stone: A Weye (3) of Cheese 32 Cloves, each Clove 7 Pounds. And for many Years past, the Hundred weight has been fixed (4) at 112 Pounds Avoirdepois, and that by a general Consent, and without any particular Law to establish it. These Weights have been universally and immemorially (5) used in England, with an Exception to the weighing of Gold, Silver, and some very few Commodities, for which the Troy Weight has been used for a great many Years. When it was first introduced (1) Cay's Abridgment Title Weights, ~ 9. (2) 25 Ed. III. St. 5. c. 9. 13 R. II. c. 9. (3) 9 H. VI. c. 8. The Weye equalled 224 Pounds. (4) That is, 14 Stone at 8 Pounds, or 8 Stone at 14 Pounds each, according to the Old Laws, and present Usage of the Stone Weight. The 112 Pound is a very convenient Weight for a Standard, because it is divisible into more even Parts than any less Number. And it is compounded from the Assise Bushel, its Half and Quarter; that is to say, 64.32, and 16 Pounds. (5) The Apothecaries (who, next to the Goldsmiths, are supposed to make the most Use of Troy Weights) seldom keep Weights adjusted to the Troy Pound heavier than two Drams; but for all above buy and sell by Avoirdepois: And with them, by the Term Libra in Measure is meant the Wine Pint; tho' this Measure is not, say they,so denominated from its containing an exact Pound-Weight of any Liquor, and the Term Uncia in Measure does not denote a twelfth Part of the Pint, but the sixteenth; though in Weight, agreeable to its Signification, it is used to express one twelfth Part of a Pound; so that an Ounce in Measure is scarce more than three Quarters of an Ounce in Weight. See Pemberton's Dispensary p. 44. 4 [67] introduced into this Kingdom, does no-where appear; but Mr. Folkes, in his Tables of the English Silver Coins (1), tells us, it was not established or used at the Mint before the 18th of Hen. VIII. By reducing the liquid Bushel, or one Eighth of the Hogshead, from 64 to 63 Pints, it seems plain that our Ancestors took the cubic Foot for their Model, the Contents of such a <inferred>Vessel</inferred> being 621/2 Pints or Pounds: And from hence, and from what has been shewn before, it is not very unnatural to conclude, that at first our Ancestors fixed and established as well their Weights as Measures from known Parts of this Model; taking always a whole Number for each primary Weight or Vessel; and from thence proceeding, by a regular geometrical Proportion, to raise the greater Weights or Measures: So that the English Foot (the undoubted and universal Standard of all Measures of Length within this Realm) is also the Standard for the Avoirdepois (2) Weights, and all Measures of Capacity. Upon (1) Page 4. Mr. Folkes says, The Pound used at the Mint before that time, called the Tower or the Moneyers Pound, was <inferred>equal</inferred> to 5400 Troy Grains: And, p. 13, 14, that the Weight of the Groat, from 13 Hen. IV. to 4 Edw. IV. was equal to 60 such Grains. Which is agreeable to what is said in an Act of Parliament of 2 Hen. VI. that the Pound Troy of coined Money was worth 32 Shillings; for 32 Shillings, or 96 Groats, at 60 Grains each, weigh 5760 Grains, or a Pound Troy. Tho', by the same Act, by reason of the Scarcity of Silver Money, and in order to bring Bullion into the Mint, it was enacted, That Silver uncoined, of the same Goodness as the Money, should be sold only for 30 Shillings the Pound Troy. (2) The very Name Avoirdepois, by which our common Weights are known, has by some been looked upon as a Proof that they I 2 were [68] Upon the whole therefore, I think it is sufficiently proved, that a cubic Vessel, whose Sides are equal to an English Foot, will contain 1000 Ounces Avoirdepois, or very near that Weight of Spring-Water: That Weights and Measures, deduced by a regular geometrical Progression from such a Vessel, or from cubic Vessels, whose Sides are equal to known Parts of an English Foot, bear an exact Analogy to each other, and to Weights and Measures raised from a Pound, according to the Words of our most ancient Assise Laws. This being considered, and that the Avoirdepois Weight is now in common Use for determining the Gravity of all heavy Bodies, that this Weight were of foreign Extraction. The first time I find the Word used in our Laws, is in an Act of Ed. III. St. 1. where it is applied to Wines as well as Corn; as it is afterwards in 25 Ed. III. St. 3. c. 2. and 16 R. II. c. 1. And in an Act 27 Ed. III. St. 2. c. 10. there is the following Clause: ` Because we have perceived some Mer` chants buy Avoirdepois Merchandizes by one Weight, and sell by ` another, we will and establish, that one Weight, one Measure, and ` one Yard, be through all the Land; and that Wools, and all man` ner of Avoirdepois, be weighed by even Balance.'' This King, in his 14th Year, had directed Standard Weights to be made of Brass, and sent into every City and Town; and I conjecture, that those Standards, from the Words of the foregoing Clause, took the Name of Avoirdepois, and were the Weights by which the Merchants used to buy. What were the lighter Weights by which they sold, does not appear; perhaps the Pound Troy. That the former were the lawful Weights, appears by an Act 24 H. VIII. c. 3. where they are so called; and Butchers, who before that time sold their Meat by Hand, were thereby obliged to provide themselves with Beams, Scales, and Weights sealed, called Haberdepois (for Avoirdepois); and in the next Reign the Avoirdepois Weights, now remaining as Standards in the Exchequer, were deposited there, as appears from the Name and Inscription thereon. [69] Weight now is, and immemorially has been, used for settling the ancient Duty of Tonnage and Poundage upon all Goods and Merchandize taken by Weight (except some few Drugs, which are charged in the Book of Rates by the Ounce Troy); and that there is not the least Proof, either in our ancient or modern Laws, to induce a Belief that this Duty was ever generally taken by the Troy Weight, or that Troy Weights were ever in general and common Use in this Kingdom, it must surely be allowed, that the Weight mentioned in our old Laws, or Acts of Parliament, was the Avoirdepois Weight. Postscript. The learned Bishop Cumberland, in his (1) Treatise, says, ` That our English Avoirdepois Ounce is the ` same as the Roman Ounce; and was probably in` troduced into this Kingdom by the Romans, when ` they gave Laws and planted Colonies here, and ` hath thence continued unchanged to this Day; ` which is not commonly observed, because we use ` the Avoirdepois Weights only about heavier Com` modities; not in weighing Silver and Gold, which ` are weighed by the Troy Ounce; which I suppose ` was introduced by the Normans, because it takes ` its Name (2) from a French Town, Troyes in ` Champaigne.' Most Authors (3) have been of this Opinion. (1) See p. 11, 103, 107. (2) Bishop Hooper, p. 432, of another Opinion as to the Derivation of the Name. (3) See Hooper's Inquiry, p. 10, 14, 92. and Arbuthnot's Tables explain'd, p. 16, and 283. [70] Opinion. This leads me to compare our English Foot with the Roman Foot, which Mr. Greaves takes as equal to 967 such Parts, as ours is 1000. The Roman Amphora or Quadrantal is generally allowed (1) to be equal to a cubic Roman Foot; and to contain 80 Pounds, or 960 Ounces. Then the Side of the Amphora is equal to (2),986 Parts of the English Foot; agreeing exactly with the Foot deduced by Villalpandus from the Congius of Vespasian; and a cubic Vessel, whose Sides are equal to,967 Parts of the English Foor, will not contain (3) quite 9041/4 Ounces; which, if true, reduces the Roman Ounce to near 4121/12 Grains Troy. (1) See Bishop Hooper, p. 152, 175. Greaves's Mis. Works, p. 198, 199, 297,303. (2) For the cube Root of 960 is 986,1. And <inferred>oz</inferred>. Parts. (3) The Cube of 967 is but 904,231063. And Mr. Greaves himself says, an Amphora made by the Pes Colotianus held only 71/2 Congii, equal to 900 Roman Ounces; which comes as near the Cube of 967, as can be expected from the uncertain Method he took to determine the Contents of that Amphora, which was by filling it with 7 Congii, and, as he guessed, about an half, of Milium.
