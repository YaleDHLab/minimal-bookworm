C 486 XXVII. An abstract of the results deducedfrom the measurement of an arc on the meridian, extendingfrom latitude 8 9' 38", 4) to latitude 18O '3 e~?,6, N; being an amplitude Of 9 3J' 4511, By Lieut. Colonel William Lambton, F. RK S. 33d Regiment offoo0t. Read May si, 4i8i8 IN the 9th vol. of the Asiatick Researches, there are detailed accounts of two complee sections of an arc on the meridian, measured by me at different times in prosecu+ing the trigo. nometrical survey of the Peninsula of India, The first is comprehended between the parallels of Punna, a station near Cape Comorin, in latitude 8 9'388,39, and Patchipolliam an Coimbetoor, in latitude lo 59g48",93; being an amplitude of *5o' io",54. The second is comprehended between the parallels of Patchipolliam and Namthabad, a station near Gooty, in the ceded districts ; and lying in latitude iS? 6' otter 1, gives an amplitude of 6'ii",28. Since these measures ments were made, I have had the good fortune to get another section, extending from Namthabad to Dautnergidda, in the Nizam's dominions, which being in latitude 18 of 23",6, gives an increase of 5 S7' 23",32; making in the whole an arc of 9? 53 45",14 in amplitude; the longest single arc that has ever been measured on the surface of this globe. The detailed accounts of this last arc, with various conclusions concerning the three sections, have been presented to the Asiatick Society by the Marquess of HIAST2NGS, the present Governor General, and will be published in the itth volume Lieut. Col. LAMBTON's abstract, &c. 487 of the Asiatick Researches. But as it mnay be three or four years before that volume makes its appearance, I have been induced to draw out this abstract of the results, thinking that the conclusions herein contained may be interesting to the Royal Society, and to the astronomers of Europe. As a reference may be made to the volumes above mentioned, I have simply given the lengths of the sides of the triangles from which the arcs are deduced, together with the lengths of the terrestrial and celestial arcs, without including either the tables of triangles, or the particulars of the astronomical observations, farther than the names of the stars, and the mean lengths of the celestial arcs, and, consequently, the mean degrees deduced therefrom. The first of these sections gives the degree due to latitude 9 4e+4, the middle point of that arc, equal 6047j 83 fathoms. The second section, whose middle point is in latitude 'le 2' 5$", gives the mean degree equal 60487,56 fathoms. The last section gives the degree equal 605ts,78 fathoms, due to the latitude of i6O 34142", the middle point of that section. In my second paper, in the i2th vol. of the Asiatick Researches, it appeared that the degree due to latitude i i 37' 49", the middle point between Punnae and Namthabad, was 60480,3 fathoms, Since that paper was sent, there has been a small correction applied to the base near Gooty, after comparing the chains with the brass standard scale. This, correction has somewhat increased the meridional distance between that base and Yerracondah south; and, consequently, the whole terrestrial arc between Namthabad and Punnue is also increased,, which now gives the degree due to latitude 488 DLeut. Col. LAMBTON's abstract of the results deduced 110 749" , equal 60481 55 fathoms. However, as there are now three distinct sections, whose respective middle points lie in SS44"; 13o2'55"; and 16' 4'42'4 ; I have thought it best to take the degrees due to these latitudes, as deduced from actual observation, using each, first with the French measure, then 'with the English, and lastly with the Swedish measure and thence obtaining a general mean for the compression at the poles. Thefirst mean of these three degrees used with the French degree, gives the compression U.2 The 309~,1' second mean of the same three degrees used with the English degree, gives 3 And the third mean of these three 313,54 degrees used with the Swedsh degree, gives 307 1L for the compression; so that the mean of these three means will give the compression at the poles 3 or 3 nearly of the polar axes; and this has been finally adopted for computing the general tables of degrees from the equator to the pole. It will be seen by inspecting the plan of the triangles, (P1. XXIII.) that all the sides from which the arc has been deduced lie so near the meridian, that no correction has been required; a circumstance that has saved much trouble. The sides being so nearly north and south, that the base reduced from each side as an hypothenuse, may be considered as a chord of an arc parallel, and so nearly contiguous to the meridian, that it may, as to sense, be taken as the chord to the same arc on the meridian; and these chords being in general short, they will be the same as the arcs, very nearly. I have ti e fere not been at the trouble of applying any correction; r if the whole arc between Punnae and Daumergidda (upwards of 68o miles) were divided into small arcs of so from. the measurement of an arc Of the meridian, &c. 489 miles each, the whole difference between these ares and tiher chords would not be more than a fathom and a haf The number of base lines in this extensive arc are , ve all measured with the chain extended in coffers wit t elevating screws, &c; and every part of the operation has been performed with the greatest posssible attention. h one near Bangalore may be considered as the first ; and its height above the sea was obtained by a series of triangles connecting it with another base near St. Thomas's Mount, whose height above the low water mark was determined by observations made at the sea beach, and at the race stand near the north end of the base (Asiat. Res. vol-viii.). The base lines to the southward are, the one in Coimbetoor, and the other near Tinnivelly, whose heights above the sea were determined from the Bangalore base. Those to the northward are, the base near Gooty, and the one near Daumergidda. The account of this last measurement and of the curious experit ments for comparing the steel chains with the brass standard scale, will appear in the l3th volume of the Asiatick Res searches. The particulars of the other measurements may be seen in the ioth and 12th volumes of the same work. The great station of observation at Doddaguntah, is near the first base line; and it was at that station where the position of the meridian was fixed for extending it to the north and south. The latitude of that station was also determined by observing the zenith distances of a number of stars from the Greenwich catalogue for i8oa. That latitude, however,a was afterwards setaside from a supposed disturbs ance of the plummet. The latitude was afterwards fixed from observations made at Puneae, the southernmost station of 490 Lieut., Col. LAMBTON'S abstract of the results deduced observation, by setting off degrees corresponding to differeznt. latitudes,-after they were finally determined. As Doddaguntah station has been left out in the divisions of the grand arc, its latitude was only useful in fixing that of Savendroog, one of the great meridian stations for crossing the Peninsula (Asiatick Researches, vol. i.). The other renaining stations of observation are, Patchipolliam, or CIoim betoor; Namthabad, near Gooty and Daumergidda, in the Nizain's dominions. We shall now see how these stations are connected by the triangles; Doddaguntah being the referring station in counting the northings, southings, &c.; and to whose meridian the whole terrestrial arc is reduced. Without regarding the order of time, we will set off from Doddaguntah to Patchipolliam, and thence to Punnae. After which we will return to Doddaguntah, and proceed northerly to Namthabad, and from Namthabad to Daumergidda. TABLE J.

Previous to this determination, it will be necessary to invest tigate the requisite formule for obtaining the compression by a comparison of measured degrees in distant latitudes; and first, by the measured degrees on the meridian. Let m' and mn be the measured degrees, in latitudes '1 and 1; and let a represent the equatorial diameter, and b the polar axis: that issupposing the earth to be an ellipsoid, let a and b represent the transverse and conjugate axes of an elliptic meridian.. Then it is known from conic sections and the a% 1, nature of curvature, that. 'H ,+ +i Ilj z ) is the radius of curvature of the ellipse at 'I1 and that a% (Cos.

With respect to the French degree, as there appears much irregularity in the different sections of the arc between Dunkirk and Mon'tjouy, I have used that between the Pantheon at Paris, and Eveaux, as given by DE ,LAMBRE in the Base du Systemne Mttrique as it appears to be the most consistent. This degree is 57066 toises, equal to 60798 fathoms. But their measurements being all reduced to the temperature of s2' of FAHRENHEIT'S thermometer, the above degree will require a deduction of 19 fathoms nearly, to make it what it would have measured by the brass standard at the tempera. ture of 620, which is our standard temperature. Hence, 6o779 fathoms is the degree in latitude 470 30' 46" to compare with the Indian measurements. Let this degree be denoted by in'; and its latitude, 470 30' 46" by '1; and let the degree 60472,83 fathoms be mg9 and its latitude g 4' W" bel Then by equation t32 1Lzeut. C1.

I shall therefore adopt it with the compression 3 for computing the general tables of degrees for every third degree of latitude from the equator to the pole. With respect, however, to the compression, that nothing may be left undone to give full and entire satisfaction on this subject, I shall here add an investigation similar to that given by Professor PLAYFAIR, in the 6th vol. of the Edinburgh hilo sophical Transactions, where, in place of using the measures of degrees due to particular latitudes, two measured arcs of large amplitudes are made use of, the latitudes of wbose extremities have been determined with great accuracy. from the measurement of an arc of the meridian, &c. i Let ADBE be a meridian of the earth, where A is at the equator, aand D at the pole. = > A Suppose F to &e any point on that meridian, and FF1 the radius of curvature of the ellipse ____ at that point. Put A C-a 'I \ M` a 1)C a b ; c being the centre of the ellipse; and let A be equal the angle AKF, the latitude E of F; or let it be the measure of the arc of latitude a Kf to radius unity, or aK: that is the measure of the angle aKf in parts of the radius aK, or untity. Let GF be an indefinitely small part of the ellipse. Then if AF = z, GH-z the fluxion of the arc AF of the ellipse; and if GH be drawn, then the angle G IF = < g Kf A orfg the fluxion of the arc of latitude af to radius 1. 'Hence as 1 : A: El FH =A.FH. But the radius of curvature FH i a' b1 (aa. Sin. 2 A + 17 Sin. A-3. Let e be the ellipticity, or a b; then b a-e, and bI 2 ae very nearly, since e' is very small. Hence FH-a3 (a -e) , (a, , 2ae Sin.

The. rmean degree for latitude ;470 2, used in that paper for determining the ellipticity, compared with the Indian measurements, was deduced from that arc and gave the compression w 6' while the general mean compression obtained by comparing these measurements with the French, English, and Swedish degrees, was 30 nearly.

As I am in hopes that another section, and perhaps more, will be added to the arc, I shall defer making any final conclusions till I see what may be done. The next station of observation, I propose to be as near the latitude of 2i' 6' 5t1 as possible, in order that the middle point of the section may fall in 19t 0 ' 4", so as to compare the. mean degree as obtained by observation, with the one computed from the increments as in the foregoing tables. I say another section, and perhaps more; because should the country to the north. ward be open and settled, there may be a possibility at some future day, of continuing the same arc to the northern Confines of Hindostan: so much , at least, seems necessary for laying the foundation of Indian geography; and if it were conducted with zeal and Judgment, it would not be a work of many years, provided the features of the country be favourable. The whole time taken up in the measurement of the arc between Punnae and Daumergidda, including the base lines, astronomical observations, &c.; that is to say, the entire field work, has only been three years and nine months; and a considerable part of the corrections for the stars, for the angles, and for the reduction of the base, were done during the time of measuring the base and observing for the zenith distances; so that I supposefouryears and a haff may be allowved for the whole work. From this estimate, the meridional arc migit be continued from Daumergidda to Dhelli in about five years, if no local impediment disturbed its progress. It is hoeverr probable that difficulties might occur in S dia's country / .DCCCXVIII S X 516 Liei t. Col. LAMBTON'S abstract of the results deduced which a northern direction from Daumergidda would render it necessary to pass through. But it would be a sufficient point gained, if a series of triangles were carried from Nagpoor in Berar, to Kalpy on the Jumna, which two places, if the maps are correct, lie nearly on the same meridian. From Kalpy, the meridional series might perhaps be continued north to the Kemaoon mountains Kalpy would also be a favourable position from which to extend a series to the east and west, and for meridian stations not more than sixty or seventy miles from each other, where tbe positions of the meridians ought to be determined by pole star observations. Data would then be had for extending the survey on a more enlarged scale over the upper provinces; and the arc between Nagpoor and Kalpy might be easily reduced to the one terminating in latitude 210 6' (that station of observation and the one near Nagpoor being connected), so as to form one entire arc between the parallels of Punnaa and Kalpy. Thus would be formed a geometrical connection between the southern and northern possessions of the East India company, and a complete basis laid for local and detailed surveys of the whole. Innumerable might be the individuals employed in carrying them into effect, and various might be the description of these surveys. By the assistance of this work as a foundation, they might all be rendered useful ; but without it, no combination of the best common surveys could ever be formed into a correct map to embrace such an extensive territory as British India. ____________________________ Rmttffii ________ _ IIZIIZI7Z7ZZZZZZZZE7____ 0 Ci) p I H If a o 0 a zVt F ' L : i; t~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~c :r--In---B----So.1-SX {2{2,*Hrtn' :l a\ Me/ 1 l Darapooram a\ 11 !
