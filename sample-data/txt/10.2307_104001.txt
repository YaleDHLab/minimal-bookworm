(196) VII. Some Observations of Eclipses of Jupiter's Satellites, made by Geo. Lynn,Esq; at South wick, near Oundle in Northamptonshire; Communicated in a Letter to James Jurin, M. D. F. R. S. and Fellow of the Royal College of Physicians, London. S I R, H E A R I N G that some Foreigners enquired for Observations of the Eclipses of Jupiter's Satellite, I have sent what I had of that Sort: They are indeed but few these two last Years, on account of my Absence during part of the Time for Observation, and also on account of the small Arc Jupiter has lately made above our Horizon. The Telescope I made use of is the same as formerly, having a thirteen Foot Object-Glass, with an Aperture of two Inches and four Tenths, and an Eye-Glass of two Inches and an half Focus. By apparent Time, at Southwick, near Oundle in Northamptonshire, Longitude West from London, 00 Deg. 30 Min. as follows: Month. D. h. ~ ~ 1730. The 2d Satellite began April 29 10 19 20 to emerge It seemed in a Minute after to be as 20 20 bright as the 4th Satellite And at full Brightness about 21 20 The (197) Month. D. h. ~ ~ 1729/30. The 4th Satellite emerged Jan. 25 9 45 nearly 1730. The 2d began to immerge Nov. 28 13 17 46 And was quite out of Sight at 19 46 1731. The 2d began to emerge March 29 11 33 8 And seem'd at full Brightness about 36 30 The 1st Satellite began April 18 11 45 10 to emerge And was at full Brightness about 46 10 Again the 1st began to emerge May 4 10 4 30 Was at full Brightness about 5 45 And passed by the 3d Satellite at 11 49 30 1730/31. The 1st Satellite began to Jan. 7 12 2 55 immerge And was quite out of Sight about 4 25 1731/32. The 3d Satellite began to Jan. 28 14 16 00 immerge Was but equal in Light to the 2d at 19 00 Quite gone at 24 00 1732. The 2d Satellite began April 30 12 23 57 to emerge The 1st Satellite began May 6 12 48 44 to emerge 1732/33. The 3d Satellite quite Febr. 18 13 5 30 disappeared 1733. Again the 3d Satellite April 2 13 3 30 disappear'd But it began to fail of its Light about 5 or 6 Minutes before. 1735. The 2d Satellite immerged May 28 10 45 00 The 3d began to emerge August 3 9 10 30 And was 4 or 5 Minutes before it came to its full Brightness. C c VIII. A
