Philos. Trans. Vol. L.TAB.XXXV. p. 859. J. Mynde Se. Extract of a Letter to John Eaton Dodsworth, Esq; from Dr. George Forbes of Bermuda, relating to the Patella, or Limpet Fish, found there. 2 April, 1758. AS a curiosity for your esteemed friend Mr. Theobald, the Captain will deliver you two fishes, intirely singular here, and never before observed amongst us. The one is of the shell kind, and changed its figure so often, that it was difficult to make a drawing. However 5 R 2 I got Read Dec. 21, 1758. [860] I got a young man to take it in two different positions, and have sent the drawings with the fish. See TAB. XXXV. The small one may be called the sea-batt; and in some sort resembles that species of animals when it is swimming. Additional Remark by Charles Morton, M.D. F.R.S. The Patella, or Limpet Fish, whose generic characters, as enumerated by Bishop Wilkins, are, that it is an exanguious testaceous animal, not turbinated; an univalve, or having but one shell; being unmoved; sticking fast to rocks or other things; the convexity of whose shell doth somewhat resemble a short obtuse-angled cone, having no hole on the top.
