[ 787 ] XXXIII. Note on Archdeacon PRATT'S Paper "' On the Effect of Local Attraction in the' English Are." By Captain A. R. CLARKE, R.E. Communicated by Lieut.-Colonel JAMES, R.E. Received June 30,-Read November 18, 1858. TFHE distances between the parallels of latitude of the principal stations of the original English Arc, as used by Archdeacon PRATT in his paper " On the Effects of Local Attraction*," are taken from the second and third volumes of the "1 Account of the Trigonometrical Survey." The correct distances, with the exception of that for Blenheim, are given at page 732 of the last published volumet of the Ordnance Survey. They are as follows:Feet. Dunnose and Greenwich .313716-9 Greenwich and Blenheim .132802-0 Blenheim and Arbury Hill .139837 4 Arbury Hill and Clifton .450225 2 Clifton and Burleigh Moor .406596 9 The distance, Greenwich to Bleinheim, is not altered, as there is no new determination of that quantity. The quantities A and {, as used by Archdeacon PRATT, do not require alteration. The following Table exhibits the values of E and A for the several arcs: Arc.

These quantities, multiplied by the lengths of the several arcs, give the following : 1st arc: amplitude is in defect 3-121 2nd arc: amplitude is in defect 1-92-8 3rd arc: amplitude is in excess 1 170 4th arc: amplitude is in excess 3-710 6th arc: amplitude is in excess 1P427 which are considerably smaller than the values obtained by Archdeacon PRATT from the data of the original work. LOCAL ATTRACTION IN THE ENGLISH ARC. 789 The diagram at page 35 of the paper referred to, will, by the substitution of the quantities just obtained, be changed to the following: D s |e. tree X B | f l to. | From the 'Account of the Principal Triangulation,' page 712, it appears, however, that the most probable deflections areAt Dunnose 1 1 . i117 South. At Greenwich 1. . 864 North. At Arbury . . . . 2-226 North. At Clifton e e * e 2447 South. At Burleigh Moor . . 3-589 South. These values result from the comparison of all the geodetical and astronomical determinations in Great Britain and Ireland. When the English arc is used in the determination of the figure of the earth, in combination with the measurements in other countries, the following system of quantities is obtained (pages 764, 765): At Dunnose . . . 1767 South. At Greenwich e 1 e P270 North. At Arbury . . 1 . P692 North. At Clifton . e . . 2864 South. At Burleigh Moor . . 3-885 South. From this it will be seen that the "; rough approximation" of Archdeacon PRATT (at page 46 of his paper), namely, the determination of the local attraction at Burleigh Moor from the form of the masses of hill in the neighbourhood, is exceedingly near the truth. He finds 3"1 660 South, which is intermediate to the quantities quoted above, viz. 3" 589 and -3" 885; but the values assigned at page 47 for the deflections at the other stations are not correctly inferred.
