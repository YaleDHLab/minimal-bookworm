[615] XXVIII. An Account of Baptisms, Marriages, and Burials, during Forty Years, in the Parish of Blandford Forum, Dorset. Communicated by Richard Pulteney, M. D. F. R. S. T O D R. W A T S O N, F. R. S. S I R, AS the subjects of the following tables have been much discussed of late, I take the liberty of putting these into your hands, encouraged thereto by your assurances, when I had the pleasure of seeing you last in town, that they might not improperly be laid before the Royal Society. If upon inspection you should continue to think so, you will do me the honour of presenting them. Read Mar. 19, 1778. Exclusive of general curiosity, I was also induced to examine the register of this place, in order to determine how far the general opinion, which gives the credit of extraordinary salubrity to this country, was founded on fact, as far as that could be proved by this mode of examination. I found that the register had been kept with sufficient 616 Dr. PULTENEY'S Account of the <inferred>sufficient</inferred> accuracy in the usual method; that, since the recovery of this place from the dreadful fire of 1731, scarcely any new houses had been built, at least on any new site; that no fluctuation in the number of inhabitants from the introduction of any new manufactory, or from any other apparent cause, had taken place; and was therefore led to conclude, that the result might prove a tolerably fair one, and more especially upon finding the excess of the baptisms above the burials so small as it appears to be. In the year 1773, when these tables were drawn up, I also procured the number of the people to be taken; by which it appeared, that there were 446 families, reckoning a workhouse of 44 persons, and three schools containing 92, as four families only, which gives nearly 43/4 to a family. The whole number of souls in the parish was found to be, males 1174, females 936, total 2110; but it must be remarked, that in this number were not included any of the inhabitants of the close adjoining villages of St. Mary, Blandford, Brianston, or Langton. From an inspection of table the first it will be seen, that 553/4 is nearly the average of deaths for 40 years; and the average of the last ten years will appear to be 54: hence, taking 55 for the average number, which also will be seen to be the exact number of burials in the year Baptisms, &c. at Blandford Forum. 617 year preceding that of the survey, it will be seen that about 1 in 38 or 39 dies yearly; and, as it can scarcely be doubted, that the errors of a survey must be on the side of omission, it may not be too much to allow 1 in 39 only. From this result, therefore, it is manifest, that although the salubrity of this place does not equal what we read of some particular villages in the North of England, or of the district of Vaud, yet it turns out very much in favour of the general opinion, and very far beyond that of London and larger towns, where the number is found to be from 1 in 20 to 1 in 26 or 28. I am, &c. V O L. LXVIII. 4 G TABLE 618 Dr. PULTENEY'S Account of the TABLE I. A table of the baptisms, marriages, and burials, during forty years, in the parish of Blandford Forum.
