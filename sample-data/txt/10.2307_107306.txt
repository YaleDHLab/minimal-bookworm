E46 Il On the AttractiOns of an extensive Class of Spher'oids. By J. Ivory, M. A Communicated by Henry Brougham, Esq. FR.-S. M.P. Read November 14, 181I. IN this discourse I propose to investigate the attractions of a very extensive class of spheroids, of which the general description is, that they have their radii expressed by rational and integral functions of three rectangular co-ordinates of a point in the surface of a sphere. Such spheroids may be cha. racterized more precisely in the following manner: conceive a sphere of which the radius is unit, and three planes intersecting one another at right angles in the centre; from any point in the surface of the sphere draw three -perpendicular co-ordinates to the fixed planes, and through the same point in the surface likewise draw a right line from the centre, and cut off from that line a part equal to any rational and integral function of the three co-ordinates: then will the extremity of 'the part so cut off be a point in the surface of a spheroid of the kind alluded to; and all the points in the same surface will be determined by making the like construction for every point in the surface of the sphere. The term of a rational and integral function is not to be strictly confined here to such functions only as consist of a finite number of terms; it may On the dttractions of a extensive Class of Spherod 47 include infinite serieses, provided they are converging ones;w. and it may even be extended to any algebraic expressions that can be expanded into such seri.ese. This class of spheroids comprehends the sphere, the ellipsoid, both sorts of elliptical spheroids of revolution, and an infinite num rber of other figures, as well such r as can be described by the revolving of curves about their axes, as others which cannot be so generated. In the second chapter of the third book of the AM!canique Celeste, LAPLACE has treated of the attractions of spheroids of every kind; and in particular he has given a very ingenious method for computing the attractive forces oG that class which in their figures approach nearly to spheres. In studying that work, I discovered that the learned author had fallen intro an error in the proof of his fundamental theorem ; in conseqience of which he has represented his method as applicable to all spheroids whatever, provided they do not diffier much, from spheres; whereas in truth, when the error of calculation is corrected, and the demonstration made rigorous, his analysis is confined exclusively to that particular kind, described alove, which it is proposed to make the subject of this discourse.. I have already treated of this matter in a separate paper, iln which I have pointed out the source of LAPLACE'S mistake,, and likewise have strictly de nonstrated his method for the instances that properly faill within its scope. In farther con. sideringr the same subject, it occurred to Ine that the investik gation in the second chapter of the third book of the Mecanique Cileste, however skilfully and ingeniously conceived is neverv theless indirect, and is besides liable to another objection of 48 Mr. IVORY on the Attractions of an still greater weight; it does not exhibit the several terms of the series for the attractive force in separate and independent expressions: it only points out in what manner they may be derived successively, one after another; in so much that the terms of the series near the beginning cannot be found with.. out previously computing all the rest. This remark gave occasion to the following paper, in which it is my design to give a solution of the problem which is not chargeable with the imperfections just mentioned: the analysis is direct, and every term of the series for the attractive force is deduced immediately from the radius of the spheroid. As the ellipsoid, which comprehends both sorts of elliptical spheroids of revolution, falls within the class of figures here treated of, I have derived, as a corollary from my investigation, the formulas for the attractions of that figure which are required in the theory of the earth: this paper therefore will contain all that is useful on the subject of the attractions of spheroids, as far as our knowledge at present extends, deduced by one uniform mode of analysis. Having mentioned the principal object of this discourse, I must likewise notice a subordinate purpose I have in view; 'it is to put in a clear light the real grounds of LAPLACE'S method, and of the equivalent method delivered in the following pages; to the accomplishment of which nothing is likely to contribute so much, as a direct and rigorous analysis perspicuously conducted. To promote the same end still farther, by preserving greater order and perspicuity in treating a subject in its own nature very complicated, this paper will be divided intotwo principal sections: in the first section it is proposed excensii'e class of Spleroids. 49 to lay dowsin the analytical propositions on which the infvesti. gation is founded: the second section will contain the solution of the pro\)ble-m under consideration. One mnore! prelim-inary observation it is proper to add. The probiern of attractionls contains two cases; when the density of the attracting body is uniform throughoutt; when it varies according to any given law: it is in the first of these two cases that the chief difficulties occur; a-nd as I have nothing new to add on. the second case, I shall here confine rmy attention to homogeneous spheroids, unitibeing supposed to denote the density.

Investigation of the Attractions of Spheroids of a particular Kind, 6. Instead of seeking immediately the attraction of a spheroid in any proposed direction, it will be more advantageous to investigate (as LAPLACE has done) the value of the express sion (to be henceforth denoted by V) which is the sum of the quotients produced by dividing all the molecules of the mass of the spheroid by their respective distances from the attracted point. For such is the nature of the analytical expression now mentioned, that if it be first transformed into a function of three rectangular co-ordinates one of which is parallel to a line given by position, and the fluxion with regard to this co-ordinate be taken; the coefficient of the partial fluxion after its sign is changed, will denote the attractive force which acts parallel to the given line. In order to demonstrate this property of the function V, we shall suppose that x, y, z denote the coordinates of the molecule dM, and a, b, c, the co-ordinates of the attracted point: then ar .r dM (a _ xy+ (b-y)2-+ (c _Z AiZ the fluent being understood to be extended to all the molecules of the mass of the spheroid: now if the fluxion of this extensive Class of Spbzeroids.6 expression be taken, making a the only variable, shal have IdV f ____ (a-t).dM where the expression on the right hand side is the attractive force parallel to a, as will readily appear by decomposing the direct attractions of all -the molecules into the partial attractions parallel to the co-ordinates. But, besides enabling us to find the attractive force in any proposed direction, the fuinction V. has another advantage; for it is this function, and not the expressions of the attractive forces,, which enters into the equation of the surface of a body, wholly or partly fluid, in a state of equilibrium.* The expression for V, exhibited above is not of a common dious form, -and on this account it becomes necessary to transform it. Let r--RI cos. 0'; y _ RI sin. 0' cos. .'; and z = Rt sin. 0' sin., w; then will RI be the line drawn from the molecule dM to the origin of the coordinates; 0' will be the angle which R' makes with the axis of x; and v-' the angle which the projection of RI upon the plane to which x is perpendicular, makes with a line given by position in the same plane: from the assumed values of x, y, z, it is easy, to derive these new values viz. x-= R' cos. 60'VR-y'--z y _ Ri' sin. 0' cos. %, /RVR, sin.

When the attracted point is without the surface, the expression for V, in order to embrace the whole nmass of the spheroid., must be integrated fromn R'I= o, to R' R, R denoting what R' becomes at the surface; from g 1 to '=! i; ,and from 'w= o to -a' _ v, 2qr being the circumference when the radius is unit. In this case V must, be reduced into a series containinig the descending powvers of r, which we may thus represent, viz. B(0) BO) B(2)B(i) v _ r + 2 &C. and if we expand the radical in the last expression of V into a similar series, and use Q0(i) to denote the same thing as formerly in No. 4, we shall get, by equating the corresponding terms,* Mec.

It would be easy to deduce from hence the attractions of heterogeneous spheroids but having nothing nexv to offer on this head, I shall refer the reader to LAPLACE'S work, No. 14, Chap. 2, Liv. 3e. The two serieses marked (a) and (6) will be found to be entirely equivalent to the formulas (3)and (4)t which LAPLACE has given in the second chapter of the -third book of aZ+3 the Mecanique Ceieste: for in effect the coefficient of a. in two of the serieses; and the coefficient of _ i__ in the a other two, are only different expressions of the same integral ffyt. d' . d . Q(i), the symbol y' being always understood to denote a rational and integral function of three rectangular co-ordinates of a point in the surface of a sphere. In point of result therefore the two methods are one and the same, and the solutions they furnish are both applicable in the same circumInstances. Neither of them can be of use, unless the radiusi of the spheroid be first reduced into such a function as y' is supposed to denote. The one solution can claimn no preference No. -x A t XNo. 703 . Mr. Ioit onM the Attractions of an toethe other, except in Odeducng the same conclusion with greater-v clearness --and expressing it with greater simplicity, and in a form better fitted to fulfil the views of the analyst. In these respects it can hardly-be denied that the procedure delivered in the' preceding pages has some advantages above that of the author of the Mdcanique Cileste. The analysis% here given is direct; and it exhibits the several coefficients in sepat rate and independent expressions derived immediately from the radius of thespheroid. On the other hand LAPLACE'S investigation isindirect; and the coefficients are -found successively by decomposing the radius of the spheroid into a series of parts which follow a known law. If we now come pare the two methods with respect to the grounds on which the investigations are founded we shall not find the same agreement between them. In this paper it is admitted as a necessary hypothesis, that the radius of the spheroid must be a rational and integral function of three co-ordinates of a point in the surface of a sphere: and, in-consequence, the result of the analysis is limited to spheroids of that description. LAPLACE, grounding his investigation on a property which, according to his demonstration, belongs to all spheroids that differ little from spheres, seems to prove that the radius of sunch a spheroid cannot be an arbitrary expression, and in this inference it is necessarily implied that the radius must be such a function as we have supposed it to be.* What in the one* Mec.

Here then the two methods are so much at variance, that if one be rigorous and exact, theother cannot be exculpated from the charge of erroneous or insufficient reasonin c. This contradiction between the preceding analysis and the procedure of LAPLACE is entirely consonant to the conclusions obtained in my former paper alluded to in the beginning of this discourse; and the origin of it is to be sought for iin the error I there pointed out in the investigation of that ,geometer. It cannot be denied that an error of calculation does exist in the de' monstration of the theorem on which that author's method is grounded: his reasoning is therefore imperfect and inconclu. sivee; and the inferences he has drawn from it cannot be sup, ported in opposition to a rigorous analysis. :io. The same procedure which has been applied to approximate to the attractions of spheroids differing little from spheres, may likewise be employed to find accurate expressions in serieses of the attractive forces of any spheroid, provided the radius of it be such a function as the analysis requires. -In both cases the research turns upon the same sort of integrals.

Therefore all those terms of the series are evanescent in which i is an even number; lbut from this the case of i= , when the term assumes, a particular-form, mustbe excepted.

Before we pursue the investigation farther, we shall stop to demonstrate a property of the attractions of a shell of homogeneousmatter bounded by the surfaces of/ Dtwoellipsoids, similar to one another and similarly placed', on-a point within the shell. If we -suppose k to denote the axis of the greater ellipsoid, and put h for the corresponding, axis of the smaller one; then the value of V relatively to the latter solid will be found merely by changing k into It in the last expression; because s contains no quantities but such as are common to the two solids: therefore the value of V, relatively 'to the shell of matter included between the twvo surfaces, will be equal ti P -b% e p djt'~ d' 2 _j/ S a quantity which is independent-on the position of the attracted point: therefore the differential coefficients of V for any coordinates ofthe attracted point are evanescent andconsequently so are the attractive forces parallel to the co-ordinates (No. 6).
