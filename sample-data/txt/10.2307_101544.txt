Some Suggestions For Remedies against Cold. As there have been Remedies found out against excessive Heat, and Means of cooling Meat and Drink; so it was lately, on the occasion of the sharp Season, suggested, That Remedies might be thought on against Cold; and that particularly it might be inquired into, 1. What things in Nature, or by Art, or Mechanical contritrivance will retain a warming Heat longest, or a melting or scorching Heat? 2. What will continue or maintain Fire longest? Some that observe common practises and vulgar Trades,take notice, That Joyners use Leaden-Pots for their Glue, alledging for a Reason, That Lead, being a close Mettal, retains the heat D d d 2 longer (380) longer than other Mettals. Cary's Warming-stone promised a warmth for six or eight hours; if it performed but for two or three hours, it would,be of great use. `Tis found by sad experience, how hurtful Bright Fires, and especially of Stone-coal are to the Eyes. To retain Fire long, certain Black Earths are useful, as we were newly informed by the Inquisitive Dr. B. That a Gentleman in Sommert set shire, called Mr. Speke, had bountifully obliged Ilminster, and his Neighborhood, by a Black Fat-Earth lately found in his Park. But the same Correspondent adds, That he never saw any parallel to a Sea-weed, which he and some of his Fellow-Students had in Cambridge in the mouth of a Barrel of good Oysters. It was smaller than Pease-halm, yet cut, it lasted two very great Fires of Sea-coal, burning bright in the midst of the Fire; and by a stroak of the Tongues, it fell into the Hearth, jingling like Mettal.
