[468] XVIII. An Account of certain perfect minute Crystal Stones, by J. Parsons, M. D. & F. R. S. T H E Drawing here annexed, TAB. III. Fig. 10. represents a small Crystal magnified; it is one of a great Number brought by a very curious Gentleman from Gibraltar, who has caused many of them to be set in Buckles of different Kinds, for the Wear of his Lady and himself: And altho' they are formed and polish'd by Nature; yet they look very bright, and produce a very good Effect in the Buckles. Read June 27. 1745. They were found accidentally. This Gentleman saw a Man cleaving a Rock near that Town, and observ'd a great Quantity of fine black Powder fall from its Crevices; and, being very curious, he examined the Powder, and found these little Stones in Clusters, consisting of no more than twelve or fourteen each; and each Cluster lying at considerable Distances from one another. They are all of the same Form, some less perfect than others, and are in general Hexagonals. XIX. Fig. 10. p. 468. Fig. 6. p. 365. IP.s. del: Fig.7. p.365. Fig.8. p.365.
