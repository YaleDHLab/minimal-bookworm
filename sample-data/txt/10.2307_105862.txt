Observations of Eclipses of Jupiter's 4 Satellites, made at Paris, in the Observatory of the Marine, in the Year 1767, with an excellent Gregorian Telescope of 30 Inches Focus, the great Speculum 6 Inches Diameter, and the magnifying Power 104 Times. 1767 True time h ~ ~ Jan. 25 11 18 17 I. 4. Sky serene. ~ well defined, the satellite 12~ losing its light, during the two last of which it was extremely small. ~ 28~ high in the east. Good observation. 1767 [455] 1767 True time h ~ ~ Jan. 25 15 9 57 E 4. Sky serene. ~ 47~ high in the west. Good observation. In both I kept ~ without the field of the telescope, to view the satellite the better. 26 15 34 34 I. 1. Clear sky. ~ well defined, 46~ high in the west. Good observation. 29 10 18 7 I. 2. Serene. ~ well defined, 22~ high in the east. Good observation. Febr. 2 17 27 13 I. 1. ~ well defined, 31~ high in the west. The satellite extremely small for a minute. Good observation. 19 17 57 56 I. 2. Sky serene round ~, being 16~ high westward. Good observation. March 8 8 31 35 I. 1. Clear sky. The satellite disappeared touching the disc of ~. Doubtful to some seconds, the opposition being this night at 10h 49~ 4~. At 10h 29~ 4~ the satellite begins to appear at ~'s eastern limb; at 10h 51~ 34~ half out; at 10h 51~ 34~ quite separated from ~'s limb. 20 7 7 26 E. 2. Clear sky about ~. The satellite emerged at 1/3 of the Planet's diameter. ~ 25~ high eastward. Good observation. April 9 7 29 50 E. 1. Serene; but the observation doubtful to some seconds, from the proximity of ~ to the Moon and the horizon. 10 14 58 18 E. 2. Clear sky; but ~ near the horizon and the Moon. Observation doubtful to 5 or 6 seconds. The satellite emerged at 1/3 of a diameter from the Planet. ~ 15~ high westward. 28 9 32 10 E. 2. Clear sky. ~ well defined. The satellite emerged 3/4 of a diam. from ~, which was 47~ high. Good obs. 1767 [456] 1767 True time h ~ ~ April 29 10 13 29 E. 3. Clear sky. ~ well defined. The satellite already emerged, perhaps for 1/4 of a minute; it recovered not its full light till 4~ after. The emersion was a diameter from ~. May 5 12 9 39 E. 2. Clear sky. ~ well defined. Satellite emerged at more than a diameter from ~, being then 25~ high westward. Good observation. 6 11 17 37 I. 3. Sky much clouded. ~ seen through thin clouds; but I think the observation may be depended on to 10 or 12 seconds. Dec. 21 18 34 32 I. 3. Clear sky. ~ well defined. Satellite entered the shadow 1 diameter from ~, after having been 2~ extremely small. Good observation. 23 14 43 47 I. 1. Clear sky; but ~ near the horizon, and ill defined. However, I esteem the observation a good one. The satellite emerged 1/3 of a diameter from ~, being then 12~ above the horizon. March 15 12 41 48 E. 1. At Colombes, near Paris, 201/3 seconds of time west of the Royal observatory. The satellite out of the shadow, with a ten feet refractor of Dollond, magnifying 120 times. Good observation. April 16 9 27 3 E. 1. At Colombes; serene sky; the satellite emerged at 1/4 diameter from ~; with a Dollond's refractor of ten feet. May 30 9 14 47 E. 2. At Calais; sky serene round ~, with a 31/2 feet refractor of Dollond, with a triple object-glass. The satellite emerged 1 diameter from the Planet, a little above the 4th satellite. Good observation. 1767 [457] 1767 True time h ~ ~ June 1 9 51 40 E. 1. At Calais; sky serene; ~ well defined. The satellite emerged at the distance of 1/2 a diameter. Same refractor. Good observation. 8 11 24 4 I. 4. At Dunkirk; serene sky; but ~ near the horizon; the belts, however, appeared plain, and I think it a good observation. The satellite was more than 6~ losing its light. Dollond's 31/2 feet refractor. 11 47 54 E. 1. At Dunkirk; serene sky; but ~ very near the horizon, and ill defined. Doubtful observation. Observations on the shadow of Jupiter's satellites, and the variations of his belts, at the Observatory of the Marine, with a Gregorian reflector, of 30 inches fo1767 cus, magnifying 104 times. Febr. 19 12 58 46 The shadow of the first satellite appeared entirely on ~'s disc, and proceeded along the upper part of the middle belt. 13 18 3 The satellite itself entered half way on ~'s disc, following its shadow on the same belt. 14 1 7 The shadow of the fourth entirely entered on ~'s disk, and running along the lower edge of ~'s upper belt. 15 3 57 The shadow of the first satellite in internal contact with ~'s limb. 15 7 27 The shadow of the first quite off ~'s limb. 15 25 23 The first beginning to go off the disc. 15 29 53 The first gone off, but still in external contact with the limb. 15 29 53 The shadow of the fourth seems advanced one half of its path over the disc. 16 29 43 The shadow of the fourth seems to be two of its own diameters from ~'s limb. VOL. LIX. N n n 1767 [458] 1767 True time h ~ ~ Febr. 19 16 42 41 The shadow of the fourth, at least, one of its own diameters from ~'s limb. 16 54 39 The shadow of the fourth looks oval, and touches ~'s limb. 17 5 35 The shadow of the fourth quite. off ~'s western limb. 17 5 35 The fourth satellite almost touches ~'s eastern limb. 17 13 34 The fourth satellite entering on ~'s disc, and forming an indentation on his limb. 17 35 32 The fourth satellite quite entered, but not so visible on the disc as the ~. The shadow of the fourth seemed larger than that of the first; it was also more perceptible; owing, perhaps, to the shadow of the first running along the upper side of the middle belt, which was darker and more conspicuous than the upper belt, where the shadow of the fourth was. It was an easy matter to form a judgment of their differences, as the two shadows were at the same time seen on ~'s disc. At 61h/4 in the morning the sky became clouded, so that the egress of the fourth from the disc could not be observed. The figure no 1 (TAB. XIX) represents ~'s disc at the moment of the entry of the shadow of the first satellite; the upper part was shaded, but less sensibly than the middle belt, which was blackish, and of a darker hue in some parts than in others. Below this middle belt, another was visible, which terminated at about two-thirds of ~'s diameter. It was narrow, but as distinguishable as the middle belt. The fig. no 2 represents the shadow of the fourth satellite, which passed along the upper belt less distinct than the middle one. At 3h 11~ the lower narrow belt was not to be seen; the middle belt was also altered, being of various shades, and different from that represented in fig. 1. at the time of the immersion of the shadow of the first satellite. The fig. no 3 represents the shadows of the first and fourth satellites, viewed at the same time. The fig. no 4 represents ~'s belts: the upper belt was the same as in fig. no 1: the middle belt was likewise the same: the Philos.Trans.Vol.LIX.TAB.XIX.p.458. I. II. 4e 1 1 III. IV. 4e 1r [459] the narrow belt, which had disappeared, appeared again on the eastern side. At 4h 30~ it was advanced 1/4 of the diameter. At 5h 58~ it extended almost from one limb to the other, as narrow and sensible as in fig. no 1. The 6th of September, 1760, having computed the ingress of the third satellite on ~'s disc, I viewed the Planet with a Gregorian reflector of 30 inches focus, magnifying 104 times. At 7h 4~ I perceived at the center of the Planet, on the lower belt, a black spot, pretty round, and nearly of the size of the shadow of the first satellite. I guessed this spot to be the shadow of the third. I observed its progress, and being got on 2/3 of ~'s disc, at 8h 13~ I perceived the shadow of the third just entered on ~'s eastern limb, and was larger than that I observed before, which made me to imagine, that the first shadow might be a spot on the very disc of the third satellite. I went on with my observations, and found, that the nearer this shadow approached the western limb of ~, the more it was diminished in size, and I lost sight of it before it had got to the Planet's limb. Lastly, at 9h 26~, the third satellite was half emerged, and formed an indentation on the disc. I was then well satisfied, that the observed spot was on the disc of the third satellite; and I took notice, that this satellite, when quite emerged, was not so luminous as usual. The 28th of March, 1766, having viewed Saturn with the same achromatic reflector of 10 feet 7 inches focus, I perceived on his globe two darkish belts; they were indeed extremely faint, and difficult to be discerned, directed, however, in a right line parallel to the longest diameter of Saturn's ring. The several observations here recited are extremely nice; and it were to be wished that astronomers, concerned in observations, might be accommodated with achromatic telescopes, of the most perfect construction; as such are the only instruments whereby a great knowledge of the celestial bodies can be acquired, for the improvement and perfection of astronomy.
