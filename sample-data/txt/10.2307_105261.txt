[296] XXXVI. The Effects of the Opuntia, or Prickly Pear, and of the Indigo Plant, in colouring the Juices of living Animals. Communicated by H. Baker, F. R. S. June 23d, 1757. MR. Baker received a letter yesterday from Dr. Alexander Garden, of Charles Town in South Carolina, part of which he hopes he shall be excused for laying before the Royal Society. Read June 23, 1757. The Doctor writes thus: `` As you desired, I `` tried the effects of the prickly pear in colouring `` the urine. A few days after your letter, I went `` down to one of the islands, and gathered some of `` the fruit, and gave four of the pears to a child of `` three years of age, and six pears to one of five. `` The next morning I examined the urine of both, `` and it appeared of a very lively red colour, as if `` tent-wine had been mixed with clear water. The `` urine of the eldest was deeper coloured, and of a `` darker look: the youngest (who always naturally `` made clear urine) was of a more lively and beau`` tiful red. Next day I gave six pears to a Negroe `` wench, who gave suck, and strictly forbad her `` suckling her child for six or eight hours; and `` then taking some of her milk in a tea-cup, and `` setting it by for some hours, the cream had a red`` dish lustre, tho' it was very faint. `` I was led to this last experiment by an observa`` tion, which I made on the milk of cows, who `` had [297] `` had fed in an indigo-field: the indigo had not `` only tinged their urine blue, but the cream of `` the milk was of a most beautiful blue colour, and `` had a radiated appearance from the centre (Is it `` not hence probable, that the dye is the oily part `` of the plant?). The milk underneath was clear `` and white as usual.'' Dr. Garden wrote, a year ago, that the prickly pear grows in great abundance about Carolina; and also that the cochineal insects are found upon it; but hitherto no attempts have been made to cure them as the Spaniards do. In hope, that some rich dye may be produced from the plant itself, Mr. Baker proposed some experiments to Dr. Garden, which he intends to prosecute this summer.
