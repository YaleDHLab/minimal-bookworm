Liber III. In quo Loci variarum dispositionum Limites assignantur. Here is the determination of the Loci plani and Solidi that arise from several ways different from the former. For example, if from two given points there be drawn several pairs of strait Lines, whose Squares together be equal to a given Square, the concourse of each pair is in the Locus planus of a Circle there determined. And (the other conditions remaining) if of each pair of Strait Lines one be drawn from a given point, and the other be perpendicular to a given strait Line, the concurse is in the Locus Solidus of an Ellipsis there determined. Afterwards there are several Problems concerning Arithmetical, Geometrical, and Harmonical mean proportionals betwixt two Extreams, and divers Methods for describing the Conick Sections by points. There are also subjoyned several addenda to all the preceding three Books. At the end of the Book are Prints of the Orthography and Gate of a Stately House built by the Author Vincentio Viviani at Florence, with the Inscriptions on the front thereof in honour of the French King Lewis XIV, from whom he had an annual Pension for many years: and o f the Family of the Great Duke of Tuseany; and of his Preceptor the Famous Galilaeo Galilaei, with a Print of Galileo's Busto in Brass, which is set over the Gate.
