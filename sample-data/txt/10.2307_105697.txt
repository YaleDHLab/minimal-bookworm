[30] VIII. A Delineation of the Transit of Venus expected in the Year 1769, by Mr. James Ferguson. To the Right Honourable the Earl of Macclesfield, President of the Royal ~. My Lord, I Beg leave to present to the Royal Society a delineation of the transit of Venus in the year 1769 [TAB. I.] which will be a much better transit for discovering the Sun's parallax than that in 1761 was. Read Feb. 10, 1763. Although I have only mentioned Wardhuys in Norwegian Lapland, and the Solomon isles in the great South Sea, as proper places for observing that transit; yet I am sensible, that any other place near the north cape will be just as well for the northern observers; and Tuberon's Isle, or St. Bernard's, or the Fly Islands, in the great South Sea, will answer as well for the Southern. Although it cannot be expected, that any delineation can be so exact as calculation, yet I hope this projection will be found to come very near the truth; and am, with the highest respect, My Lord your Lordship's Mortimer-Street, and the Royal Society's Feb. 10, 1763. most obliged humble servant James Ferguson.

The most proper places for observing this Transit would be Wardhuys, aport Town in Norwegian ~.& some of the Solomon Isles (as St.Cruz) in the Great South Sea For in both these places the whole Transit will be seen from beginning to ending. Moreover in Lapland ~ line of the visible Transit will be longer than the transit line supposed to be seen from the Earth's center, and the time of the Planets ~ it will be yet longer on account of its ~ apparent motion being slower by Lapland's moving the same way. But at the Solomon Isles,the Visible law of the Transit will be shorter than that supposed to be seen from the Earths center, and the time of Venus's describing it will be still more shortened, on account of the apparent quickness of her motion arising from its being in a ~ direction to ~ of the Solomon Islands ~ We have assumed 8~1/2 for the quantity of the sun's ~ in this delineation, and if that be its ~ ~, the duration of the Transit will be 25 minutes 41 seconds longer as seen from Axis of the Ecliptic ~ than as seen from the Solomon Isles, supposing them 140~ west of London&the visible Latitude of Venus, at the middle of her Transit will be 32~ greater at these Isles than at Wardhuys, If the Sun's parallax be either greater or less than 8~1/2 the difference of the visible durations of the Transit will be greater or less accordingly. So that if these differences be well ascertained by Observation,the Sun's parallax will thereby be found, and consequently his distance from the Earth, and from every other Planet in the Solar System.

A northern Parallax in Latitude retards the time of Ingress, as seen from any given place &'accelerates the time of Egress, by the number of Minutes that the half-transit Line on the Sun's ~ is shorter as seen from the given place than as seen from the Earth's center, when ~ passeth above the Sun's center, as in this Transit; & a Southern parallax in Latitude accelerates the Ingress, and retards the Egress, d e d u c e d. as seen from any given place. with respect to the time thereof as seen ~ ~ ~ ~ to be 0. 00. 8. 5 from the Earth's center, by the number of Minutes that the half-transit ~ parallax 0. 00. 29. 8 line on the Sun is longer as seen from the given place than as seen from ~ parallax from the Sun 0. 00. 21. 3 the Earth's center.
