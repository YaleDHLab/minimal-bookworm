[ 639 ] XXIX. On the Analytical Theory of the Conic. By ARTHUR CAYLEY, FRS. Received May 8,-Read May 15, 1862. THE decomposition into its linear factors of a decomposable quadric function cannot be effected in a symmetrical manner otherwise than by formulac containing supernumerary arbitrary quantities; thus, for a binary quadric (which of course is always decomposable) we have (a, b, cx ')(a, b 3 y)2 Prod. {(a, 6, cax, y)8*', y')+-xa-(y-y)}; or the expression for a linear factor is 1a -8ty2 { b_ c___ _,__)_ac-b _2(Xy1_Xly)j, which involves the arbitrary quantities (x', y'). And this appears to be the reason why, in the analytical theory of the conic, the questions which involve the decomposition of a decomposable ternary quadric have been little or scarcely at all considered; thus, for instance, the expressions for the coordinates of the points of intersection of a conic by a line (or say the line-equations of the two ineunts), and the equations for the tangents (separate each from the other) drawn from a given point not on the conic, do not appear to have been obtained. These questions depend on the decomposition of a decomposable ternary quadric, which decomposition itself depends on that for the simplest case, when the quadric is a perfect square. Or we may say that in the first instance they depend on the transformation of a given quadric function U=-(*3x, y, z)2 into the form W2+V, where W is a linear function, given save as to a constant factor (that is, W-0 is the equation of a given line), and V is a decomposable quadric function, which is ultimately decomposed into its linear factors, QR, so that we have U =W2+ QR. The formula for this purpose, which is exhibited in the eight different forms I, II, III, IV, I(bis), II(bis), III(bis), IV(bis), is the analytical basis of the whole theory; and the greater part of the memoir relates to the establishment of these forms. The solution of the geometrical questions above referred to is (as shown in the memoir) involved in and given immediately by these forms. It is also shown that the formula are greatly simplified in the case e. g. of tangents drawn to a conic from a point in a conic having double contact with the first-mentioned conic, and that in this case they lead to the linear Automorphic Transformation of the ternary quadric. The memoir concludes with some formula relating to the case of two conics, which however is treated of in only a cursory manner. MDcccLxII. 4 s 640 MR. A. CAYLEY ON THE ANALYTICAL THEORY OF THE CONIC. Article Nos. 1 to 17, relating to a single conic, 1. The point-equation of the conic is (a, b, c, f, g, h:x, y, Z)2=0, which expresses that the point (x, y, z) is an ineunt of the conic. The line-equation of the same conic is I I 4ia -O a a, ht, w2 A, b, f higb,f Cg5 f, c or putting (A, B, C, F, G, H)=(bc-f'2, ca-g2, ab-h2, gh-af, hf-6qfg--h), the line-equation is (A, B, C, F, G, H)g, n, 4)2=0, which expresses that the line (E, a, I) (that is, the line the point-equation whereof is {x+;y+4z=O) is a tangent of the conic. We are thus in the analytical theory of the conic concerned with the quadrics (a, b, cif, g, hrx, y, z)2 and (A, B, C, F, G, Hg 2, which are the characteristics or nilfactums of these equations respectively. 2. I put also Ka, A, g K h, 6, f g, f, c or, what is the same thing, K=abc-af 6g2-ch2+2fgh. 3. It may be convenient to notice that when (a, ..3x, y z)2 breaks up into factors, the conic the equation whereof is (a, ..Xx, y, Z)2= 0, becomes a pair of lines; and that when (a, . .(X, y, Z)2 is a perfect square, the conic becomes a pair of coincident lines, or say a twofold line. But a pair of lines, distinct or coincident, cannot be represented by a line-equation. The analytical formulae presently given show that in the former case (A, . .)C, 4, a))2 is the square of a linear function, which equated to zero gives the line-equation of the point of intersection of the two lines, or node of the conic; and the equation (A, . .), g2, 0)2 0 accordingly represents such point considered as a pair of coincident points, or say a twofold point. But in the latter case, where the conic is a twofold line, (A, . .3t, 7, ?)2 is identically equal to zero, and the line-equation (A, . .), a, ?)2 = 0 is a mere identity 0 = 0, thus ceasing to have any signification at all. And the like remarks apply to the conic as represented by the line-equation (A, . .), a, )2=0, the conic here breaking up into a pair of distinct or coincident points, &c. 4. It is proper to remark also that MR. A. CAYLEY ON THE ANALYTICAL THEORY OF THE CONIC. 641 is the equation of the polar of the point (x', y', z") in regard to the conic, and that (Al -.KI, n%?Xt' is the line-equation of the pole of the line (I', a', I'); or, what is the same thing, the point-coordinates of the pole are AV + Hni'+ G?':M t+ B;7'+ Frt GE'+ F;'+ CX' 5. The inverse matrix is ( Gi heg )1(As Ho G) h, b6 f H, B, F t go if? c G, F, C but it is convenient to disregard the factor K) and speak of (A, B, C, F, G, H) as the inverse or reciprocal coefficients. The equation just written down implies the relations Aa+Hh+Gg=K, Ah+Hb+Gf=O, &c., which may be arranged in two different ways as a system of nine equations. 6. We have also (BC-F2, CA-G2, AB-H2, GH-AF, HF-BG, FG-CH)=K(a, b, c,f g, h), and ABC-AF2--_BG2-CH2+2FGH= Ki2 which are well-known theorems. 7. I notice also the theorem =(A,..I(yz'-y'z, za/--ZX ,yx_'x'y)2, which is much used in the sequel: it may be mentioned, in passing, that this is included in the more general theorem (a, * X, y, z:j', ml, n'), (a, . .:(a', yt, z'(1, en, n) (A, ' ' zx'-z'c, xy'-xy,)nmn-m'n, ni'-nl, Im'I-1Im), which is at once deducible from Ll +Mm +Nn, L1 +?M'm +N'n Ll'+ Mm'+ NnW, L'I'+ M'm'+N'W' =(MN'-M'N)(mn2'-m'n) + (NL'-NL)(nI'-n'l) + (LM'-L'M)(Im-I'm), by writing therein (L M, N)=(ax +hy +gz, hx +by +fz X gx Off +f z), (LT, M', N')=(a'+hy+gz', hx'+by+fz g'+f'+cz') 4 s2 642 MR. A. CAYLEY ON THE ANALYTICAL TUEORY OF THE CONIC. 8. Suppose now that (a, b, c,f, g, hsX, y, z)2 breaks up into factors, or say that we have (a, b, c, f, g, h)vx, y, z)2 2(ax +fPy+yz)(dx + Py+7'z), the values of the coefficients (a, ..) then are (a, b, c,f, g, h) =(2 aa', 2jPj3', 2yy', Py'+'Y, Y'7'+7'c) '3'+oJ13), and forming from these the inverse coefficients (A, ..) and the discriminant K, we find (A, B, C, F, G, H)=-( y'-fry, ry '-r'a1 yes f P)2. K=O. 9. The last-mentioned equation, K-0, is the condition in order that (a, . .:X, q, Z)2 may break up into factors; and when it does so, we have (A, ..A ^ )2 _2(f y ~~t d AP,84] that is, (a, ..(X, y, Z)2 breaking up into factors, (A, .X{, , )2 is a perfect square; and equating it to zero, we have UP7-st "M yasp_~t)8)]2=0; which, (E, a, 4) being line-coordinates, gives (as a twofold point) the point of intersection of the lines (os, f3, y), (ovt, A', r')' that is, the lines oax+ i3y+yz=O, OM'x+3'&+7'z=O. 10. If (ac, .. j, y, Z)2 is a perfect square, then a': ,3': ='=,: 13: y; whence not only, as before, K=O, but the coefficients (A, B, C, F, G, H) all vanish (this implies the firstmentioned condition K=0); and the line-equation (A, . .)t, a, )=0 becomes the mere identity 0 = 0. 11. Conversely if Ka= 0, then (a,. .)X, y, z)2 breaks up into factors; and if (A, B, C, F,G, H) all vanish, then (a, . .(X, y, z)2 is a perfect square. The conclusions stated ante, No. 3, are thus sustained. 12. I assume, first, that (a, . .jX, y, Z)2 is a perfect square (No. 13); and secondly, that it breaks up into factors (No. 14); and I proceed to inquire how in the one case the root, and in the other case the factors, can be determined in a symmetrical form. 13. Considering the before-mentioned identical equation (a, ..3 jx, y, z)2. (a, ..(x', y', Zt)2 _[(a, ..3(x, yt, Z:(X' y', z')] 2=(A, ..:yz'-y'z .x'-z'x XYfXy if (a, ..X, y' Z)2 is a perfect square, then by what precedes, the right-hand side of the equation vanishes, and we have (a, . .3t a, Y Z)2_ [(a, . .XX, y, z)I/, y', z')]2 and the root of (a, . .Xx, y, z)2 is thus seen to be (a,. . , y, Z)a', y ' ZI) an expression which involves the quantities (x', z') the values whereof may be assumed MR. A. CAYLEY ON THE ANALYTICAL THEORY OF THE CONIC. 643 at pleasure without altering the value of the expression. For instance, assuming for (a', y', z') the values (1, 0. 0), (0, 1, 0), (0, 0, 1) successively, the different values of the expression are ax+hy+gz hx+by+fz g +fy+cz 7/ 7 -,/ But if, as assumed, (a,..(x, I y, z)2 be a perfect square =(ax+f3y+ryz)2, then (a, b, c,fg, h)=(2, 32 , ar), and each of the foregoing values becomes equal to the root ax+py+&Iz. It is somewhat singular that it is not possible to obtain symmetrical formulae without employing in this manner supernumerary arbitrary quantities such as (a;', y z'). 14. Next, if (a, .. *(a;, yi Z)2 instead of being a perfect square, only breaks up into factors, then in the foregoing identical equation the right-hand side is a perfect square, and by the formula just obtained its value is [(A, *..3X, Y. Z:Cyz'-y'z, za:' zigs XyrZ1y)]' ~~~A* ( X~ ) Z) where (X, Y, Z) are supernumerary arbitrary quantities. The identical equation then gives (~~~~~~~ a X$)y =( Az i)2 {[( a, * * , y, Z3SXI, yl, Zft)] 2 +[( A, * .X, Y, Z (yzl_ l t a (4~~1 .:(,x Y,7 z K~AqX, X) Z)2 and consequently (a,. .)IY:)a , ~ , z)22 Product of (A, . c(X, Y, Z}Eyz y'z, zx z'x, xy'-x'yfl {(a)~~~~~~~~~ @3$y i . /(Al SECX, Y.

It will be remembered that (A,..) denotes the system of inverse or reciprocal coefficients (bc-f2,...). 15. Consider the formula (a, b, cuf, g, hXns ''t, ?a '-2-, (a, b, c, f, g, hXy', 911, n9)21 which gives a= c2 2 b42-2fn, b= at2 +c2 -2gj, c= bg2 +a42 2h~, f _ -ajft2 +gw +hg, b "~,j:lI/'i ~_6 ChmIL47 644 MR. A. CAYLEY ON THE ANALYTICAL THEORY OF THE CONIC. and from these we deduce ( a, h, g J =aI)=(0, 090), h, b, f viz. aX+hn+gC=0, &c. Also (bc-f2, ca-g2, ab-h2, gh-af, hf-bg, fg-ch)=({, a, 452.(A, B, C, F, G, H)a, n, that is, bef2=a2(A, B, C, F, G, HXid ;, ;)29 &c. Whence also (bef2u.X, , n)2 -(ja+Mn+qa4)2(A* )2 and (bef2, . .:(l m, nAl', m', n')=(It+mn+nt)(l',+mln+n'4)(A, ,)2 and moreover abcaf2 -bg2ch2+2fgh= 0. 16. The last equation shows that (a,.'.Xw ' -Hi/ rfa at _ )2 considered as a function of (I', a', A'), breaks up into factors. Or since the expression is not altered by interchanging (E', a') A') and (I, a, A), the same expression, considered as a function of I, a,), breaks up into factors. It is in fact easy to see that any quantic whatever, (*)8fi'_r' Hi'-I'd, id'-)m considered as a function of (I, a, '), breaks up into linear factors; for in virtue of the equation I'(a'0')+'(C'")+'(i''i)=0, any one of the quantities p2"r 9 /-/ ai' -a. can be expressed as a linear function of the other two; so that the quantic can be expressed as a linear function of any two of the three quantities; and qua homogeneous function of two quantities, it of course breaks up into factors, linear functions of these two quantities. We may in all the formulae interchange (xS, y, z ') and (x, y, z), writing (a', b, c, fVI g', h') in the place of (a, b, C, f, g, h). 17. Putting, in like manner, (A, B, C, F, G, Hjyz'-y'z, zx'-z'x, Xy'4Xly)2 so that A= Cy2+Bz2 -2Fyz = Az2 +Cx12 -2Gzx, d;= Bx2+Ay2 2llHxy, f= --Ayz --X2 + Gxy&+Hzx, (i=-Bzx+FxyGy2 +Hyz, If=-Cxy+Fzx+ G~yz.-HZ2, we obtain ( A, A, e (XY, z)=(OOO )! , IF .

Assuming that it is satisfied, the cubic equation in 0: 0' has a pair of equal roots; or say there is a twofold root and a onefold root; the twofold root gives the pair of lines drawn from the point of contact to the other two points of intersection, the onefold root gives the pair made up of the common tangent and the line joining the other two points of intersection. 36.
