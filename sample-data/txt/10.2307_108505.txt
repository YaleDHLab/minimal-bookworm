[ 311] XIV. On certain Properties of square numbers and other quadratic forms, with a Table of odd numbers from 1 to 1 91, divided into 4, 3 or 2 square numbers, the algebraic sum of whose roots (positive or negative) may equal 1, by means of which Table all the odd numbers up to 9503 may be resolved into not exceeding 4 square numbers. By Sir FREDERICK POLLOCK, F.R.S., Lord Chief Baron. Received, Dec. 20, 1853,-Read, Dec. 22, 1853,-Revised by the Author, Nov. 1854. SOME years ago, in examining the properties of the triangular or trigonal numbers 0, 1, 3,6, 1, 015 &c. n(n-1) I observed that every trigonal number was composed of 4 trigonal numbers, viz. 3 times some prior trigonal number plus the next in the series, either immediately before or after that prior number; thus 45 =10+10+10+15 55=15+15+15+10; or generally, as all numbers are of the form 2nI or of 2n, all trigonal numbers are of one of the 2 forms, 2n2n, 2n2+n, 2n2-n=n _nn2_+n and 2n2+n=-2 X 3+ 2 I found also that all the natural numbers in the interval between any two consecutive trigonal numbers, might be composed of 4 trigonal numbers, having the sum of their bases or roots constant, viz. the sum of the roots or bases of the 4 trigonal numbers which compose the first of the 2 trigonal numbers. This will be best explained by an example: the roots or bases are placed over the numbers, and it will be observed their sum is constant in the same interval. 312 SIR F POLLOCK ON CERTAIN PROPERTIES OF SQUARE NUMBERS, ETC. 8x9 3 4 4 4 =15 2 -36 6 10 10 10 3 3 4 5 15 37 6 6 10 15 2 4 4 5 15 38 3 10 10 15 2 3 5 5 15 39 3 6 15 15 2 3 4 6 15 40 3 6 10 21 1 4 5 5 15 41 1 10 15 15 1 4 4 6 J5 42 1 10 10 21 1 3 5 6 15 43 1 6 15 21 2 2 4 7 15 44 3 3 10 28 9X10 4 4 4 5 17 2 = 45 10 IO 10 15 3 4 5 5 17 46 6 10 15 15 3 4 4 6 17 47 6 10 10 21 3 3 5 0 17 48 6 6 15 21 2 4 5 6 17 49 3 10 15 21 3 3 4 7 17 50 6 6 10 28 2 4 4 7 17 51 3 10 10 28 2 3 5 7 17 52 3 6 15 28 1 4 6 6 17 53 1 10 21 21 1 4 5 7 17 54 1 10 15 28 1OXi1 4 5 5 5 =19 2 55 IO 15 15 15 5 5 5 6 From 55 to 66 (=15, 15, 15, 21) the constant sumn of the bases wvill be 19, and this may be continued without limit. If the law by which this can be continued were discovered and proved, it would furnish the means of proving FERMAT'S theorems of the polygonal numbers; but not being aware of any law by which the series that fills up the intervals could be continued, I turned my attention to the square numbers as containing (apparently) a greater variety of theorems, and as being (certainly) of all quadratic forms that which SIR F. POLLOCK ON CERTAIN PROPERTIES OF SQUARE NUMBERS, ETC. 313 is most familiar, and in which calculations or comparisons may be made with the greatest facility. Very lately I observed the following property of square numbers: If any four square numbers a2, b2, c2, d2 have their roots such that by making one or more positive and the rest negative, tile algebraic sum of the roots may equal 1; then if the roots whose sum is one less than the others be each increased by 1, and the others be each decreased by 1, the sum of the squares of the roots thus increased and decreased will be equal to a2+b2+c2+d2+2. Let a+b-c---d=1, and let c and ` d become c+l, d+l, and let a and b become a-1, b-1, then (a1)2+(b-1)2+(C+ l)2+(d+l)2=a2+ b2+c2+d2+2 X (-a-b+c+d)+4, but 2 X (-a-b+c+d)-2, therefore the sum of the squares of the new roots--a2+b2+c2+d2+2. If a-b -c-d= 1, the result is the same, decreasing a and increasing each of b, c and d by 1. The theorem is more general (as might have been expected). THEOREM A. For if instead of 1 the algebraic sum of the roots be equal to 2n1, and the negative roots be numerically increased by n and the positive roots be decreased by n, the increase in the sum of the squares of the new roots thus formed will be 2n. Let a+bc-d=2n1, then (a-n)2+ (b-n)2+ (c+n)2+ (d+n)2==a2+b2+c2+d2 -2an-12bn+2cn+2dn+4n2, but .-2an-2bn+2cn+2dn=-(2n-1)x2n=-4n2 +2n, .-. the sum of the squares of the new roots=a2+b2+c2+d2+2n. The following table shows the result of different algebraic sums of the roots, with the corresponding increase or decrease of roots and increase of the sum of the squares.

There is a similar theorem with respect to the decrease of the sum of the squares. THEOREM B. If a+b-c-d=2n+1 (instead of 2n-1), then if a and b be each diminished and c and d be increased by n, the sum of the squares of the new roots will be less by 2n, and (a-n)2+(b-n)2+(c+n)2 + (d+n)2 will equal a2+b2+ c2+d2-2n.

The use that may be made of these theorems will best appear by an example or two. 51 is composed of 4 square numbers, 25, 16, 9, 1, whose roots are 5, 4, 3, 1. 4 + 3-51=1 5 + 3 4 1= 3 5 + 4 31= 5 5 + 4 + I 3= 7 Then, by Theor~er A. square numbers which compose 53, 55, 57, and 59 may be obtained) and bay Thleorem B. those which compose 49, 47, and 45 lby-adding to or subtracting from the roots,; thus 5 + 4 3 1 _ 5 = 2 X 3 15 n = 3 3 3 3 3 being deducted or' added, 2 1 6 4 become the new roots, the suns of whose squares=57=51I+2 X 3. 5 + 4 + I 3 _7 =2 X 3 + l, n _3, 3 3 3 3 2 1 2 6 are -the new roots, the sum, of, whose squares=45=51-2X3.

This method of obtaining the square numbers that compose a succession of odd nurh ers, suggested that if a metheo similar to what was observed in the trigonal numtbters were adopted as to the square numbers, the series of odd numbers might be SIR F. POLLOCK ON CERTAIN PROPERTIES OF SQUARE NUMBERS ETC. 315 resolved into square numbers. In the trigonal numbers the successive bases of the 4 trigonal numbers into which the terms of the trigonal series are each divisible, are 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 2 1 2 2 2 2 2 2 3 2 3 3 3&c, If instead of using these numbers as bases or roots of trigonal numbers they be squared and added together, they furnish a series (1, 3, 7, 13, 21, 31, &c.) whose general term is m2+mn+ 1, or according as m is even or odd, 4n2?2n+ 1 this expression is manif estly divisible into square numbers whose roots will be either n, n, n, n+ I -or n-1, n, n, n, and the sum of the roots will be 4n+1, and with reference to integral quantities will be a maximum. The terms of the series 1, 3,7, 13, &e., furnish steps, places, or positions at which the process of increasing the sum of the squares might commence again, and as far as any law of increase is applicable to one term it is applicable to all. I have therefore called this series 1, 3, 7, 13, &c. the gradationseries of this system of resolving the odd numbers into square niunbers not exceeding 4. I have prepared a table in which the odd numbers from 1 to 191, respectively, are divided into square numbers not exceeding 4, the algebraic sum of whose roots mnay be made equal to 1. This table of the odd numbers up to 191 is at the end of the paper; the terms of the gradation-series (as they occur) are distinctively denoted, and all the sets of roots of the odd numbers up to 191 are capable of forming 1 as their algebraic sumt; and by means of this series any odd number from 4n2+2n+ 1 up to 4n2+2n+191 inclusive, may be divided into not exceeding 4 square numbers, whatever be the value of n. The examination of this series led me to observe a remarkable property of odd numbers with reference to the square numbers (not exceeding 4) into which they may be divided, and which may be stated in the following theorem, THEOREM C. Every odd number may be divided into square n umbers (not exceeding 4), the algebraic sum of whose roots (positive or negative) will (in some form of the roots) be equal to every odd number from 1 to the greatest possible sum of the roots, or the theorem may be stated in a purely algebraical form thus: If there be 2 equations, d+b2+c+d=2n+ I and a+b+c+d=2r+1, a, b, c, d being each integral or nil, n and r being positive, and r a maximnum, then if 2 s2 316 SIR F. POLLOCK ON CERTAIN PROPERTIES OF SQUARE NUMBERS, ETC. any positive integer r' (not greater than r) be assumed, it will always be possible to satisfy the pair of equations W2=, +y'+z.=2n+ 1 w+x+y+z=2r'+ 1 by integral values (positive, negative, or nil) of w, x, y, z. I now propose to show in what manner the table may be used, so as to divide into square nurnbers (not exceeding 4) any odd number from 1 up to 9503, and any odd number whatever of the form 4n2+2n+2p+1, where p is not greater than 95 [95 X 2+1=1911. If 2p+ I =a2+b2+c'+d2, and if also a+b+c+d= 1 (a, b, c, d being integral numbers, positive, negative or nil), in other words, if the odd number 2p+1 be such that the algebraic sum of the roots of the square numbers (not exceeding 4) which compose it may be equal to 1, then it will follow that m2+m+ l+2p may be resolved into square numbers (not exceeding 4) the sum of whose roots will equal 2m+ 1, for m2+m +1 is of the form. 4n2+2n+1; let it equal it, and m2+m+1+2p=4n2+2n, (a+b +c+d) +a2+b2+c2?d2 (na)2+ (nb)2+ (nc)2+ (n+d)2 (manifestly 4 square numbers), and the sum of the roots_4n+ (a+b+c+d)=4n+ 1 =2m+1. Let the function M2+m+ 1 be designated by the notationfni. If every odd number from 1 up to 2m+ 1 can be resolved into (not exceeding) 4 square numbers, the algebraic sum of whose roots may equal 1, then every odd number fromfm tofm +2m inclusive may be resolved into 4 square numbers the sum of whose roots may equal 2m+1; but the next odd number tofm+2m isf(m+l), and sincef(m+l) is resolvable into 4 square numbers, the sum of whose roots=2m+3; if every odd number from 1 up to 2m+1 can be resolved into not exceeding 4 square numbers the algebraic sum of whose roots= 1, then every odd number from 1 up to f(m+l)+2m is resolvable into 4 square numbers, andf(m+l)+2m-m2+5m+3. In the Table the highest odd number 191 =2X95+1, therefore m=95; and every odd number from 1 up to 952+5 X 95+3 =9503 may be resolved into not exceeding 4 square numbers, by means of the Table, also every odd number of the form 4n2+2n +2p+1, whatever be the value of n, provided p be not greater than 95; for example, let it be required to resolve 9301 into 4 square numbers, the next less number of the form m2+m+1 is 9121_952+95+14,482 .2.48+1, 9301=9120+181. 181 by the Table is resolvable into ]12+42+82+ ]02 and1+4+8-10 1 9301 =(48+ 1)2+ (48_-4)2+ (48s 8)2 +(48+ 1 0)2 =492+442+402+582; so 4n2+ +181 is always resolvable into 4 square numbers, whatever be the value of n, and the roots of the square numbers will be (nil), (n+ 4), (n+8), (nT 10). SIR F. POLLOCK ON CERTAIN PROPERTIES OF SQUARE NUMBERS,. ETC. 317 If the following series of equations be assumed, 1+2d =2q+1 3+2d1=2q+ 7+2d2=2q+ I 13+2d =2q+ 1 m2+m+1+2dm_1=2q+1, and if each of the quantities 2d+ 1, 2d1+ 1, 2d2+ 1, 2d,+ I ...2dmI+ 1 can be resolved into 4 square numbers, the algebraic sum of whose roots=-, then the given odd number 2q+ I may be resolved into successive sets of 4 squares, the sum of whose roots will be successively 1, 3, 5, 7...2m+1. Hence an odd number, 2q+l, may be resolved into 4 square numbers, the sum of whose roots shall be equal to 2p+1, if upon adding I to the difference between 2q +1 and the (p+ 1)" term of the gradationseries, the difference so increased can be resolved into 4 square numbers, the algebraic sumn of whose roots= 1. If it be required to resolve 37 into 4 squares, the sum of whose roots shall equal 7= 2 x 3+1 here p =3, the (p+ l)' or 4th term of the gradation-series is 13; 13 is of the form 4*22 22+ 1, and it equals 22+22+22+12 (2 l)2; the difference between 37 and 14=24, increased by 1=25, 25=12+22+22 +42, and the roots+1-2-2+4=1 and 13+24=(2+2)2=42, 42) 12,-22 (2 +2)2 (2-1)2 (24)2 and +4+4+1-2=7. If, therefore, every odd number can be resolved into integral square numbers (not exceeding 4) whose algebraic sum will equal 1, then every odd number can be resolved into integral square numbers (not exceeding 4) whose algebraic sum will be 1, 3, 5, &c. [viz, all the odd numbers up to the maximum]. I propose (in order not to leave the Theoremr C. unproved) to show by the properties of numbers already proved, that every odd number may be resolved into integral square numbers (not exceeding 4) whose algebraic sum will equal 1. Every odd number may be represented by 2p+1 (p being any integer): then by FERMAT'S theorem of the polygonal numbers (as proved by LEGENDRE, Th6orie des nombres), p must either be a trigonal number, or composed of two or three trigonal q~+ q numbers. If it, be a trigonal number, then p= 2 and 2p+l=q2+q+1, which equals 4n2+ 2n+ 1, which is divisible into (n? 1)2,n2 n2, n 2, and n-n+n.+ (n+ 1) = 1. 2 -qr2+r If p be composed of 2 trigonal numbers, p-q+2 and the sum of any two trigonal numbers is of the form of a2+a+bS* and may be assumed equal to a2+a+b', * If 2 numbers be both odd or both even, they may always be represented by a + b and a-b; if one be odd and the other even, they may always be represented by ad b+ ?1, a-b or a+ b, a-b ? 1; and if the 2 numbers be made the bases of trigonal numbers, the sum of the 2 trigonal numbers will always be of the form a4+ a Abor a2+b+b5. 318 SIR F. POLILOCK ON CERTAIN -PROPERTIES OF SQUARE NUMBERS, ETC. therefore 2p+1=2a2+2a+2b'+I = (a+al)2 ' a2 b2, b2, and the roots (a+ l),-a, b, -b_=l. If p be composed of 3 trigonal numbers, then p=a2+a+b2+ 2 and 2p+I=2a2+2a+2b'+m2+m+1, but m2+m+I is of the form 4n2+2n+1, whose four roots (as already seen) are n+ 1, n, n, n, and if these roots be varied thus, +a+n+ I a-n b+n b-n, the squares of these four roots will equal 2a2+2a+2b2+4n2+2n+ 1, and the algebraic sum of these roots obviously may=I. It follows from this, that every possible odd number may be divided into integral square numbers (not exceeding 4), the algebraic sum of whose roots= 1. I propose in a future communication to give a different proof of the Theorem C, and instead of proving' the Theorem C. by FERMAT'S proposition of the trigonal numbers, I shall offer a proof of FERMAT'S proposition of the trigonal numbers by the Theorem C; it is obvious that they are so connected that either may be proved from the other. I am not aware that the theorems A, B, or C, or the method above described of using a gradation-series, have ever been noticed before, and as they appear to add something (however little) to the theory of numbers, I have ventured to present them to the attention of the Royal Society. NoTE.-Numbers of the form 2n+2 (even numbers) may be resolved into square numbers (not exceeding 4), the algebraic sum of whose roots may always equal 2, and so far they have an analogous property, but they do not possess the analogous property of being resolvable into roots whose algebraic sum will=2, 4, 6, 8, &c.
