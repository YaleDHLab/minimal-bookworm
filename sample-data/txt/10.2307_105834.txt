[262] XXXVI. Astronomical Observations made at the North Cape, for the Royal Society. By Mr. Bayley. 1769 April 28, 29, and 30, got the observatory and dwelling-house built, and instruments on shore. ~ May 1 Set up an oak plank 4 3/4 inches thick, and 14 inches wide. This plank was set a little more than 2 feet in the ground, and well rammed with earth and stones so that it was very steady and firm; to which I screwed the astronomical clock truly perpendicular (by which means it was independant of the observatory and its shaking by the wind) and set it going nearly with sidereal time. ~ 3 Set up the transit instrument nearly in the meridian. ~ 4 Examined the line of collimation of the quadrant, and found it correct. Examined the clock, and found the pendulum to vibrate 1~1/2 on each side of nothing. Here follow some corresponding altitudes of the Sun, from which the going of the clock is determined. Z. D.

During these observations the air was red and hazy, and the Sun's limb very tremulous, and the spots in the Sun very indistinct, and Venus seemed very ill defined when on the Sun. But a better idea will be formed of the bad appearance of Venus at the internal contact, owing to the very hazy state of the air, from the representation of it, plate XIII.

From whence the longitude of the point called the North Cape is 25~ 49~ east of Greenwich. Clouds came on, so that I saw the Sun no more till 3h 38~ 0~ per clock, and it broke away very clear, and continued clear to the end, which was at 3h 48~ 19~ per clock, or 22h 59~ 17~ apparent time. The air being very clear, the end seemed certain to about two seconds. The telescope used was a reflector of 2 feet focus, made by Mr. Dollond; and the magnifying power, applied for the ingress of Venus, and the beginning and end of the solar eclipse, was 100. The magnifying power used with the micrometer, was 50. 2 Adjustments [269] Adjustments of the telescope with the different eye-pieces and little speculums, as combined together when used. N.

The Value of the Scale of the Object Glass Micrometer was found as follows: A base of 120 feet was carefully measured on level ice (which was covered with frozen snow about half an inch thick), with two 10 feet fir rods; and the measure being taken four different times, no one differed from any of the others so much as 1/10th of an inch. But as the fir rods might not consist of 10 feet exactly of the same standard from which the micrometer scale was laid off, I therefore took six inches between the fine points of a pair of compasses, from the micrometer scale; and, by repeating this measure, found the exact length of the fir rods in measures of the micrometer scale; and thence corrected the length of the base, found immediately by the rods, and reduced to the standard of the micrometer scale. Perpendicularly over the base, at one end, was placed the center of the divided object glass, and perpendicularly over the base, at the other end, a board was placed, having its plane at d h b right angles with the base line, white paper pasted on its upper part; and at the height of the center of the object glass, nearly above the horizon, A was a strong black line drawn, as A B = 8 inches, A g and A e being small e g B but equal distances from A; by bringing (e d and g h) to coincide alternately with (A a) the error of adjustment of the micrometer scale was a found; and by separating the glasses till (A a) and (B b) made but one line; from this separation the value of one extent of the micrometer scale was found, by making this proportion. As the length of the base: is to the length (A B):: so is 206265~ (the number of seconds in an arch equal to the radius of a circle) to a fourth number, which will be the seconds of the angle measured by that opening of the glasses, which is shewn by the micrometer scale; and other angles will be in direct proportion to the respective measures whence the table was formed.

By a great many trials with a very good compass, of Dr. Knight's construction, I found the variation to be 6 degrees west; and by a dipping needle, I found, by repeated trials, the dip of the north end of the needle to be 79 degrees. May 15, at 13h 1/4 P. M. apparent time, or 1h 7~ after high water, by a mean of 7 observations, I found the dip of the horizon of the sea, from the observatory, to be 12~ 18~. Height of the barometer 29,70 inches; thermometer, without, 24~; thermometer, within, 28~. And May 20, at 7h 3/4 P. M. apparent time, or 7h 33~ after high water, from a mean of 8 observations, I found the dip = 12~ 25~,5; barometer 29,70 inches; thermometer, without, 43~, and, within, 40~. Both these observations were made on the N. N. E. point of the true compass. During each of these observations the water was very smooth, and the horizon clear.-I found it was high water, at the full and change of the Moon, at 3h 44~ P. M. apparent time, at the Cape; and, by a series of observations, I found the water to rise 8 feet 1 inch, nearly, perpendicular at the spring tides; and at neap tides 6 feet 8 inches, perpendicular; and the tides seemed to follow very regular, as they ought to do when not disturbed by bad weather June 8, I found the height of the observatory 140 feet 6 inches above low water mark.

[272] The I N S T R U M E N T S used at the N O R T H C A P E, by Mr. B A Y L Y. were as follows: A quadrant of 1 foot radius, and two thermometers, made by Mr. Bird. A 2 feet reflector, with an achromatic object glass micrometer, by Mr. Dollond. A transit instrument, of 4 feet, made by Mr. Bird; with an achromatic object glass, by Mr. Dollond. A barometer, by Mr. Ramsden. An astronomical clock with a gridiron pendulum, a journeyman clock, and an alarum clock, by Mr. Shelton. A dipping needle, belonging to the Royal Observatory, made by Mr. Graham. A like set, exclusive of a dipping needle, was used by Mr. Dixon, at the island of Hammerfost. N. B. The adjoining chart, and views of the sea-coast and islands, near the North Cape of Europe, Tab. XIV. were drawn from the joint observations of Messieurs Dixon and Bayly. XXXVII.
