[ 201 ] XIV. On the pendulum. By J. W. LUBBOCK, Esq. F.R.S. Read March 11, 1830. CAPTAIN KATER was the first who made use of IIUYGENS'S theorem with respect to the convertibility of the centres of suspension and oscillation to eliminate the moment of inertia, and to obtain the length of the simple pendulum by measuring the distance between the knife edges or axes of suspension. But this very ingenious method of determining the length of the simple pendulum must be considered as a first approximation, which is true only when many circumstances which might affect the truth of the result are not taken into account, but of which the following investigation shows that when the experiments are conducted with care, the effect is insensible. It is, however, desirable to ascertain carefully the limits of the errors which may rise from the circumstances to which I have alluded, and to render the theory of Captain KATER'S pendulum as perfect as the method of observation. LAPLACE has given a complete theory of the apparatus used by BORDA in the Connaissance des Temps; and he has shown that in the apparatus of Captain KATER, the distance between the knife edges is equal to the length of the simple pendulum, when they are considered as cylinders of small curvature, provided their radii of curvature are equal; which theorem is also proved in Professor WHEWELL'S Dynamics. But no one I believe has yet discussed all the circumstances which affect the accuracy of Captain KATER'S method; and I have therefore attempted to do this in the following paper, in which I have treated the question with the utmost generality, taking the case of all possible deviations and of axes any how placed, provided only that they are synchronous. I have taken the pendulum used by Mr. BAILY, and described by him in the Philosophical Magazine of last February, to afford a numerical example, and I MDCCCXXX. 2 D 202 MR. LUBBOCK ON THE PENDULUM. have given the errors which would arise in the length of the simple pendulum. corresponding to given deviations of the knife edges: it is difficult to make the results intelligible without the use of symbols; but I may add, that the effect of a small deviation of one of the knife edges in azimuth is quite insensible: this is not the case with a deviation in altitude : a deviation of a degree in altitudeincreases by 3 the vibrations in twenty-four hours : a deviation from horizontality in the agate planes has a more sensible influence than either of the former deviations: a deviation in horizontality in the agate planes of 1O' increases by about 6 the vibrations in twenty-four hours: both these deviations have the effect of rendering the distance between the knife edges greater than the true length of the simple pendulum. I have also considered the case in which the agate planes are fixed on the pendulum and vibrate on a fixed knife edge; and I find, as might be expected, that the length of the simple pend-ulum is equal to the distance between the planes. Let Ox, Qi, Oz be rectangular coordinate axes meeting in the point 0 in the plane (x y), upon which the pendulum rests ; let the plane (x z) be vertical and the plane (x y) nearly horizontal, and let the axis of rotation coincide with the line Ox. Let g be the force of gravity, a the angle which a vertical line makes with the axis Oz. a the distance of the centre of gravity from the line Ox, and M (a2 + k2) the moment of inertia of tIle pendulum about the axis Ox; then according to the analysis of M. 10ISSON, (TraitA de M6canique, p. 116.) the length of the simple pendulum which oscillates in the same ti me is d' ? k a Cos ? Let G x,, Gym, G z, be the three principal axes which intersect each other in the point G. and let the equations to the axis Ox referred to the coordinate axes G x,, G y,, G z,, which are fixed in the pendulum and move with it, be x, tan t + f tan 6 %I xi + z and Y are small angles which may be considered as the deviations of the knife edge in azimuth and altitude.

I have endeavoured as far as possible to conform to the notation of M. POISSON in the Traite de Mecanique; but this is rendered difficult, because M. POISSON sometimes takes the axis Ox to be vertical, (vol. ii. p. 113,) and sometimes the axis Oz (as vol. ii. p. 185), and he uses the letter s in two different acceptations, (vol. ii. pp. 119 & 185.)
