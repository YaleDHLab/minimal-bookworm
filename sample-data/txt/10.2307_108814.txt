[ 617 ] XXIX. First Analysis of One Hundred and Seventy-seven Magnetic Storms, registered by the Magnetic Instruments in the Royal Observatory, Greenwich, from 1841 to 1857. By GEORGE BIDDELL AIRY, Astronomer Royal. Received November 28,-Read December 17, 1863. 1. IN a paper which the Royal Society have. printed in their Philosophical Transactions for 1862, I gave a series of curves exhibiting to the eye the diurnal inequalities of Terrestrial Magnetism in the three directions of Westerly Force, Northerly Force, and Nadir Force, as inferred from eye-observations and photographic registers at the Royal Observatory from 1841 to 1857. The paper, or the works to which it refers, exhibits also the secular change and the annual inequality through that period, and the lunar inequalities as inferred from the period 1848 to 1857. These results were obtained by excluding the observations of certain days (of whch a list was given) on which the motions of the magnetometers were so violent that it was difficult to draw a mean curve through the magnetic curve of the day. In the present paper I propose to give the principal results deducible from the days omitted in the former paper. But before entering into the details of the numerical investigations, I think it desirable to explain the principles upon which both parts of the investigations have been conducted. 2. The methods commonly employed in late years for measuring and classifying the effects of magnetic disturbance have been, in my judgment, very valuable to the science, especially in its earlier stages. But familiarity through many past years with magnetic photograms has strongly impressed me with the feeling that a different method ought now to be employed, taking account of relations of disturbances which perhaps could not be known at the introduction of the ancient method. I may thus describe the general ideas which have guided me:-First, that there is no such thing as a day really free from disturbance, and no reason in the nature of things for separating one or more days from the general series. There is abundant reason for such separation on the ground of convenience of reduction; but when the reduction has been effected by suitable process, the results of the separated days ought to be combined with those of the unseparated days in the formation of general means (the numerical necessity for. which I propose to consider in the close of this paper),-the reduction of the separated' days serving also to throw great light upon the natureof the acting forces on those days, which forces in all probability are acting, though in different degrees, on other days. Second, that, with our present knowledge of the character of -magnetic disturbances, I cannot think myself justified in separating any single magnetic indication, or any series of indications defined-only by their magnitude; nor do I entertain the belief that any 3IDcccLxILI. 4 p 618 MR. AIRY-ANALYSIS OF MAGNETIC STORMS special value could attach to the results which I might derive from observations from which such indications have been removed. The study of the photograms shows clearly that the successive indications at successive moments of the same day are a connected series; there is no such thing as a sudden display of force in any element; the sharpest salience which is exhibited on a generally smooth -curve occupies at least an hour in its development (I believe, never less, although the individual saliences in a continued storm are of shorter duration), and during this time the force has been gradually increasing and gradually diminishing. Under these circumstances, I cannot think it right that I should cut off a part of that salience, with the belief of obtaining results, that can possess any philosophical value, from the part which is left. And I come to the conclusion that each disturbed day must be considered in its entirety, and that our attention ought to be given in the first instance to the devising of methods by which the complicated registers of each of those days, separately considered, can be rendered manageable, and in the next place to the discussion of the laws of disturbance which they may aid to reveal to us, and to the ascertaining of their effects on the general means in which they ought to be included. 3. The discrimination of the classes of days which (on the one hand) are treated by the general process in the "C Results of Magnetical Observations, 1859," and of those which (on the other hand) are to be treated by the methods of this Memoir, has been effected entirely by the judgment of the Superintendent of Computations as to the certainty and accuracy with which he could draw a mean line through the disturbed curves. I do however entirely recognize the propriety-of defining the "I disturbed days'" by some numerical limit, when it can be conveniently done: but, the day being defined, I then think that the entire disturbed day or storm ought to be treated as a coherent whole; and that the laws of disturbance and the amalgamation with general means ought to be deduced from it, as already mentioned, without reference to any numerical limit. 4. The records of disturbances from 1848 to 1857 are taken from the photograms; and the value of these, I believe, is unimpeachable. The instruments appear to have been in the highest state of efficiency; I do not think that there is the least doubt on the indications of any disturbed day. And (as the effect of adjustments made expressly for that purpose) the traces of the most violent motions are in general perfectly preserved-an advantage which is possessed, I believe in a peculiar degree, by the photograms of the Royal Observatory. Some sheets may be lost from defects in the paper, defects in the chemical process, &c.; but none, I believe, from rapidity and violence of motion of the magnets. The indications for every salient point of the curves have been translated into numbers which are printed in the " Results of Magnetical Observations" for each year; and those numbers are used as the basis of the following calculations. For the years 18414847, in which observations were made by eye, it will be seen in the printed Observations that no o pportunity was lost, on the slightest appearance of di-sturbran$e, of following most -carefully the indications of all the magnetometers: and in fa~ct, as regards both the number -of dys of such observations and the number of OBSERVED AT TIE ROYAL OBSERVATORY, GREENWICH. 6419 observations on; each day, the observations taken are far more numerous thanwas necessary. The judgment of the Superintendent has been exercised in making such a selection of days and such a limitation of records for each day as should make the adopted register for the period. 1841-1,847 harmonize well, with, that; for the period 1848-1857. In the following investigations, whenever one, instrument has exhibited such signs of disturbance that its indications were thought unfit for treatment in. the former Reductions and are therefore included in this Analysis, the indications of the two other instruments are also included in this Analysis.. 5. In deciding on the method, of making the disturbed curves more manageable, the * following was my train of ideas. As the photographic curve usually consists of a series of lines (very little curved) highly inclined to the time-abscissa and leading alternately upwards and downwards, if each of these lines be bisected, and the bisecting points be joined, the joining lines. will form a polygon of muchless violent character than the original. If these joining lines be: bisected and the bisecting points joined, we shall have a polygon of still smoother character, with, angles sensibly corresponding to the original times, excepting only the first and the last. If the double process be repeated, the polygon will be still smoother, but wanting points corresponding to the two first and two last observations. And thus we shall have a mean curve containing all the long waves of the original curve, and freed from the irregularities of short period, whose values, however,, can be measured. Numerically, each step of the. process. is represented by taking, for the numerical value of a new ordinate, the arithmetical mean of the numerical values of adjacent ordinates,. or, still more easily, by adding the adjacent ordinates, adding the adjacent sums thus formed, and dividing by 4, and repeating this operation. An instance will make this process clear. 4rP2 620 MR. AIRY-ANALYSIS OF MAGNETIC STORMS Readings for Northerly Force (corrected for temperature) in the Magnetic Storm of 1854, March 6.

Thus we finally obtain the following separation of numbers, whose aggregate represents the Original Reading.

One part consists of five long waves, alternately and +. The other part consists of irregularities of short period, which do not show the least symptom of disappearing at the disappearance of the waves, and appear to have nothing in common with them except the connexion of both with the same general Magnetic Storm. 6. For fully understanding the import of these numbers, it will perhaps be necessary to study the succession of numbers in each individual instance. In this First Analysis, I have proceeded, as the first step, to take the means that appear to be most valuable. As regards the Waves, I have taken separately the mean of the wave-disturbances through each wave. But as this quantity gives little information unless taken in conjunction with the time through which it acts, I have multiplied it by the length of the wave in hours; and this product I have distinguished by the technical term Fluctuation. The 622 MR. AIRY-ANALYSIS OF MAGNETIC STORMS following is now an Epitome of the Magnetic Storm which we have had under consideration.

The numbers contained in these Epitomes serve as bases for the investigations which follow. The Epitomes themselves, though greatly reduced from the voluminous calculations on which they are founded, are far too extensive to be included in this Memoir: -they will probably be printed in the Greenwich Observations. 7. Treating the Waves as the first subject, I take in the first instance the algebraical aggregate of the Fluctuations for each separate Magnetic Storm. In Table I., the first or longest of the three Tables which follow, every recorded storm is included; and in the second, or Table II., these are all collected to form annual aggregates. But as the days of record do not strictly coincide for the three instruments, partly from accidents in the chemical preparation of the photographic paper, &c., but more particularly from the experimental state of the Vertical-Force Instrument during a part of the year 1848, I have thought it desirable to form Table III. from the observations which are strictly comparable. In regard to the last columns of each department of Table I., and the last lines of Tables II. and III., it will be remarked that the "; Fluctuation " is a product of number of hours by Magnetic. Disturbance, and therefore, for the Mean Disturbance, the Aggregate of Fluctuations must be divided by the Sum of Hours.

AIRY-ANALYSIS OF MAGNETIC STORMS 8. The most remarkable of the results of these Tables is, not only that upon the whole the Algebraic Aggregate of Fluctuations for the Northerly Force is negative (which has been previously recognized), but that it is negative in every separate year. It will be seen in Table I. that on some separate days the Aggregate of Fluctuations is positive, but the number of days is only 22, in opposition to 155 with negative Aggregates. The Aggregate for the Westerly Force is also negative: and though the different years do not consent in the same way as for the Northerly Force, yet their discordance is not so great as to justify us in setting aside this indication, although there may be greater doubt upon the accuracy of its value. This Aggregate (taken in comparison with that for the Northerly Force) appears to show that, on the whole, the direction of Disturbing Force is 10? to the East of South. The Aggregate for the Nadir Force appears greater, but it is very uncertain; it might be nearly destroyed by the omission of a single year. 9. These characteristics of the directions of the disturbing forces will appear also in the following enumeration of the instances in which the first and last waves of each Magnetic Storm are affected in different ways. In comparing the numbers it must be borne in mind that, when there is only one wave, that wave is considered, in different places, both as the first and the last. Westerly Northerly Nadir Force.

AIRY-ANALYSIS OF MAGNETIC STORMS 11. In examining the last line of these Tables, it must be borne in mind that the numbers are affected by the constant part of the Disturbance which appears as " Mean Disturbance " at the end of Table III. The value of mean disturbance for Nadir Force (as has been remarked) is uncertain, and that for Westerly Force is small; but that for Northerly Force is important. A constant term 00147, combined with variable quantities whose mean value is + 00250, and whose actual value even at the maximum of its wave will very frequently be far less, will destroy some waves entirely. It will also increase the apparent Mean of Absolute Disturbances, even when the number of waves is not diminished. Thus: suppose, as a simple case, that the pure disturbance is represented by a sin 0, but that, when affected with a constant term, it is a sin 0b. (As has been stated, when a is smaller than b, the addition of -b will make every value -, and will destroy the alternation of + waves and waves, and thus the just number of waves will be apparently diminished.) When a is greater than b, if 0 be the first value of 0 which makes a sin v-b=0, the positive Fluctuation will be found by integrating from d=0 to 0=sr0, and the negative Fluctuation by integrating from 0=v-0 to 0=2zr+O. The general value of the integral is -acoso 0b; the first limited integral is 2acos 0-b(,r-20): the second is 2acos 0-6b(r+20), or (with sign changed, to make it positive) +2a cos 0-b(-r20); and the sum of these, or aggregate of absolute fluctuations, is 4a cos 0 + 4 . 0. Now 0 is deterb b mined by the condition a sin 0-b= 0, or sin 0= -. If b be small, 0= nearly, a a Cos 0=12 nearly, and the aggregate of absolute fluctuations =4a+ k. The 2a0 a second term is the increase of the aggregate arising from the introduction of the term b. If then we conceive the numbers in the last line of Table VI. to be affected with the correction which ought to be introduced in order to neutralize the effect of the large constant term in Northerly Force, it is certain that the number 375 would be considerably increased, and that the number 6 3124 would be considerably diminished. A very extensive examination of details would be necessary to enable us to say what would be the exact proportion of the changes: but it appears to me extremely probable (though at present far from certain) that the corrected Numbers of Waves are sensibly equal, the corrected Absolute Sums of Fluctuations are sensibly equal, and the corrected Means of Absolute Disturbances are sensibly equal, for Westerly Force and for Northerly Force. The Number of Waves for Nadir Force is less than half that for the other forces; and the Absolute Sum of Fluctuations is about three times as great as that for the others. 12. It would be very important to ascertain any correspondence in the times of the waves in the different directions. I have not yet succeeded in discovering any satisfactory or certain relation. First, in comparison of the Waves of Westerly and Northerly Forces, the coincidences of times of wave are so rare that it seems evident that nothing can be inferred from the few which can be found. From 1849 to i857, when the photographic apparatus recorded equally the disturbances at all hours, I do not find one. In a less rigorous examination of the storms from 1841 to 1847, I find that on Nov. 19, 1841, there OBSERVED AT THE ROYAL OBSERVATORY, GREENWICH. 635 were contemporaneous waves from 12h 17m to 131) 17m, W. F.+, No. F.+; and on Jan. 1, 1842, when the storm consisted of a single wave, 6h Om to 12h 41m, the forces were W. F.-, No. F. +. And the second W. F. -on Jan. 16, 1848, corresponds nearly with the sole No. F. . Sometimes two waves in one direction correspond nearly with one in the other direction: thus in the beginning of the storm 1854, April 10, the W. F.+ from Oh 7rn to 5h 21m and from 5h 21m to 13", 16m occupy the same time as No. F.+ from Oh 5m to 13h 9m: but this relation is not supported in the remainder of the same storm. A more frequent relation appears to be, that the evanescence of one wave corresponds with the maximum of the other: thus on February 21, 1852, and March 7, 1853, the waves stand in this order: Westerly Force. Northerly Force. Limits of Character Limits of Character Waves. of Waves. Waves. of Waves. 1852. Feb. 21 .... . 0_12 49 + 3*14 ~~5.16} + 1853. Mar. 7 ..... . , . 642 + 5731} + 12.20} 7which relation, however, in the latter instance, is not maintained through the storm. And, generally, this relation does not appear to hold through the whole of any one storm consisting of numerous waves. 13. As the number of Nadir Waves approximates to half the number of Westerly Waves, it might seem worthy of inquiry whether the maximum of Nadir Wave corresponds to a change of Westerly Wave.

The classification in Article 9 appears to lead to no result as to the effect of connexion of special signs of the first or last waves of the different forces. The inequalities shown in the first Table of Article 9 (of which the difference of numbers of last wave + and numbers of last wave-for the Northerly Force is the most remarkable) are quite sufficient to explain the inequalities in the combinations exhibited in the latter part of Article 9. And, on the whole, the principal conclusions which can be deduced from the examination of the Waves appear to me to be the following:That, while on the whole the Westerly Force is yet the number of + waves is the greater; and at the beginnings and ends of storms the number of + waves is greater than the number of waves in a proportion exceeding 3: 2. That, the Northerly Force being on the whole -, in two instances out of three the first Northerly wave i's and in ten instances out of eleven the last Northerly wave is That, due regard being hadto the effect of the constant Northerly Force, it appears probable that the number of waves and the mean value of wave-disturbance are nearly the same for Westerly Force and for Northerly Force; but That for the Nadir Force the number of waves is less than one-half the number for the other forces, while the mean value of disturbance is more than double that for the other forces. 15. I now proceed with the Irregularities. The following Tables (VII., VIII., IX.) exhibit their aggregates under the same divisions as those for the Waves. It will be remarked that, from the nature of the process by which the Irregularities are found, their algebraic sum in each storm is sensibly =0; and therefore they are treated here only as numbers without sign.

'00115 '00119 '00125 16. The mnost striking particulars in the last line of these Tables are the following: First, the almost exact equality of the Mean Coefficients of Irregularity in the three MDCCCLXTII .. 4s> 642 MR. AIRY-ANALYSIS OF MAGNETIC STORMS elements. And this remarkable agreement proves that the Irregularities as measured here are real objective facts. For they are measured from photographic sheets in which the scales are very different: on the Westerly and Northerly records, 0 01 of Horizontal Force is represented by 2-87 inches and 2-55 inches, while on the Nadir record 0 01 of Horizontal Force is represented by 0O88 inch. Yet the eye of the Reader of the Photographs has caught the Irregularities when shown on this small scale as certainly as when shown on the larger scale. With reference to their physical import, I think it likely that the equality of Coefficients of Irregularity may hereafter prove to be one of the most important of the facts of observation. Second, the near agreement in the number of Irregularities for Westerly Force and for Northerly Force. Third, the near agreement in the number of Irregularities for Nadir Force with half the number of Irregularities for Westerly or for Northerly Force. 17. I have not succeeded in discovering any clear relation between the times of occurrence of Irregularities of Westerly Force and of Northerly Force. They certainly do not coincide. In their interrmixture, I cannot assert that an Irregularity of one element always occurs between two of the other element, though there is a general appearance of that law. 18. It appeared to me possible that an Irregularity of Nadir Force might occur at the change between + and Irregularities of Westerly Force; and the following examination seems to show a certain degree of plausibility in the supposition: Number of Nadir IrreguDay. Total Number of larities corresponding to Day. Nadir Irregularities. changes of sign for Westerly Irregularities. 1841. Sept. 25 61 52 1847.

The investigations which I had proposed to myself as more peculiarly the object of this paper are now terminated, in so far as their results can be comprehended in tables of numerical values and remarks on the relations between the numbers. But I think it desirable to subjoin Tables tending to exhibit the laws of frequency of the great wave-disturbances and the irregularities, with respect to the months of the year and with respect to the hours of the day.. 20. First, for the months of the year. The following numbers are formed by simply collecting from Tables I., IV., and VII. all the numbers arranged in groups under each nominal month. It will be seen at once that the distribution of magnetic storms through the year is so irregular that, even in the long period of seventeen years, no inference can be drawn connecting the Magnetic Storms with the Seasons.

Secondly, for the hours of the day. For each hour, on a day of storm, the nearest. value of wave-disturbance (not of fluctuation) and the nearest value of irregularity were taken from the sheets in which the reductions described in Article 5 were made; and all the numbers thus found were collected for each hour, the + and values of wavedisturbance being placed in separate columns. Thus the following Table is formed. 4 s2 644 MR.

This arises partly from the interruptions which are almost unavoidable in the operation of changing the photographic sheets at Oh, and partly from the manner in which the measured quantities have been treated in the discussion of Storms. When a storm has evidently occupied a part of a day, it has been usual to treat by rule the measures of the entire sheet of that day, from 0" to 241; and in that process, as is described in the beginning of Article 5, the two first and two last measures are lost; and some of these ought, in a great number of cases, to be -referred to Oh. The best value that can be taken for Oh will be the mean of the values for 23h and for 1h. 22. It will be seen that, at the same hour, the mean value of Irregularity is nearly the same for the three Forces,but that, from hour to hour, the mean Irregularities are largest where the number of measures is greatest, that is, where storms are most frequent. In regard to the Wave-disturbance; for, Westerly Force, the aggregate is + from 17 to 6,from 7" to 16"; for Northerly Force, the aggregate is + from 3" to 5", from 6" to 2"h; and for Nadir Force, the aggregate is + from 23h to 1Oh, from 11" to 22". In regard to the modification which these Wave-disturbances might be supposed to produce on the laws of Diurnal Inequality, when it is remarked that each OBSERVED AT THE ROYAL OBSERVATORY, GREENICH. 645 of the hours Oh, 1h, 2h, &c. has been repeated 17 X 365 times, it will be seen that the introduction of these Storm Days into the general mass of observations will in no instance alter the mean Diurnal Inequality by a unit in the fourth decimal place. In a year of very great disturbance, as 1853, they may possibly introduce a correction of one unit, or perhaps two uits, in the fourth decimal of some of the Diurnal numbers. 23. The import of the numbers of the last Table will be best seen by the following treatment. If for either of the three directions of force, at any one hour, we form the Algebraic sum of the + and sums of wave-disturbances, and divide by the number -of measures, we obtain the mean wave-disturbance whenever a storm occurs at that hour. If we form the Absolute sum, and divide it similarly, we obtain the double average departure from that mean whenever a storm occurs at that hour. The mean Irregularity is obtained by simple division.

AIRY-ANALYSIS OF MAGNETIC STORMS 24. I now come toithe consideration, of the physical inference from these numerical conclusions. And first I would remark that I do not think that they can be reconciled with the supposition of definite galvanic currents or definite magnets, suddenly produced, in any locality whatever, as sufficient to explain the disturbances observed here. On that hypothesis, it would seem necessary to believe that such sudden currents or, magnets would produce simultaneous disturbances in the three co-ordinate directions, that, if the long period of a wave permitted some deviation from this rule, yet the shortperiod of an inequality would admit of no such deviation, and that, on any supposition, the number of disturbances in the three directions would be approximately equal. Yet. in fact we find that neither in Waves nor in Irregularities is there the least appearance of simultaneity, and that,, though there is close equality of numbers between the Westerly and Northerly Forces, yet the Nadir Force (in which the Irregularities are as strongly marked as in the Westerly and Northerly, and the Wave-disturbances much more strongly marked) exhibits less than half the number. These considerations appear to me quite conclusive as showing that the observed disturbances cannot be produced by the forces of any suddenly created galvanic current or polar magnet. 25. To suggest instead of this an imperfect conjecture, based upon grounds so inadequate as those which we can at present use for its foundation, must be a delicate and dangerous, I may almost say an invidious enterprise. Yet the impression of an explanation of broad character, partly definite but generally indefinite, has, in. the course of this investigation, forced itself so strongly on my mind, that I should think it wrong to omit to describe it. Its fundamental idea is, that there may be in proximity to the earth something which (to avoid unnecessary words) I shall call a Magnetic Ether; that under circumstances generally, but not always, having reference to the solar hour, and therefore probably depending on the sun's radiation or on its suppression, a current from N.N.W. to S.S.E., approximately, or from S.S.E. to N.N.W. (according to the boreal or austral nature of the ether) is formed in this Ether; that this current is liable to interruptions or perversions of the same kind as those which we are able to observe in currents of air and water; and that their effect is generally similar, producing eddies and whirls, of violence sometimes far exceeding that of the general current from which they are derived. 26. Our powers of observing the two elements to which I have referred for analogy are somewhat different but both imperfect. We know that in a gale of wind, the direction of the wind is continually changing; the horizontal pressure and the barometric pressure also are continually changing; but the changes are so rapid that we cannot easily determine wthether there is any correspondence between them. But, in the storms on a large scale, there is reason to think that some winds are radial, but far more are cyclonic; that in some instances the barometer rises in the centre, but in' more it is depressed; and in many instances the disturbance of vertical pressure is enormous (for 1 inch of barometer corresponds to a pressure of about 70 lbs. per square foot). Of water, perhaps the best study is tobe .found in disturbed tidal currents, as those of the OBSEI-VED AT THE ROYAL OBSERVATORY, GREENWICH. 647 Western Islands of Scotland ; here, in some places, approximately circular spaces are to be seen which are quiet, but. which appear, to the eye to be elevated above the rest; in some disturbed places the water is thrown upwards; in other places the sea is whirling round with great speed, in a good circular form, and with a funnel of considerable depth in the centre; in other places, boiling currents are running very fast in opposite directions, though separated by no great space; the general impression however is that of circularity*; great circles and small circles coexisting. Though these circular forms may be more prevalent in one part of the sea than another, they are not fixed, but wander irregularly, sometimes suddenly disappearing, and sometimes as suddenly created anew. In like, manner, in the course of a river, travelling funnels may be seen, whose depth sometimes exceeds their breadth. 27. Now it appears to me that if a sentient and reasoning being were immersed either in the air or in the water through which these circles are wandering, he would perceive actions nearly similar to those which we have found to exist in the magnetic storms. The large and slowly-displaced circles would produce Wave-disturbances, slowly changing their direction, and thus having different times of evanescence in the N. and S. direction (on the one hand) and in the E. and W. direction (on the other hand); the smaller circles, in like manner, would produce the rapid Irregularities. And in the relation between E. and W. disturbances and vertical disturbances, there is a point which well deserves attention. When a water-funnel passed nearly over the observer, travelling (suppose) in a N. direction, he would first experience a strong current to the E., afterwards a strong current to the W. (or vice versa), and between these there would be a very strong vertical pressure in one direction, not accompanied by one in the opposite direction; thus he would have half as many vertical as horizontal impulses. This state of things corresponds to the proportion which we have found throughout for the magnetic disturbances, and to the relation found in Article 18. I may also add that the rule at which we have arrived, that the waves of vertical force are few, but that their power, when they do occur, is very great, seems to correspond to what is reported of the whirlwinds of great atmospheric storms; which, violent and even frequent as they may be, occur very rarely at any assigned place. 28. It seems to me that there is so much plausibility in these suppositions as to justify me in expressing a wish that some effort night be made to verify them. The immediate object of observations would be, to ascertain through a locality of considerable extent the times and magnitudes of Wave-disturbances and of Irregularities on the same days throughout, with the view of discovering whether they could be collectively represented as the effects of such travelling vortices as I have suggested. In regard to the extent of the locality, I should think that a portion of the Continent of Europe would suffice, and that five or six magnetic observatories would decide the points under inquiry. In regard to the mode of observation, though eye-observation is, for a limited time, the most accurate, yet self-registering record is the only method which can insure the * I have been upon these currents, and in close proxim~ity to these whirlpools. 648 MR. AIRY-ANALYSIS OF MAGNETIC STORMS. observation of all that is required; only, I would specially observe, it is indispensable that eye-observations be used to check the zeros of time and of measure, and, that the photographic traces be so strong that they will not be lost in rapid motions of the magnet. In regard to the mode of primary reduction, I imagine that the method followed in this Memoir (with such small alterations as experience may suggest) will be found best. ** The computations for the "Diurnal Inequalities " were performed by computers under the immediate superintendence of Mr. JoHN LucAs; some portions of them were revised and corrected by JAx5s GLAISEER, Esq., F.R.S., Superintendent of the Magnetical and Meteorological Department of the Royal Observatory.
