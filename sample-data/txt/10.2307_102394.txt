(687) III. Part of Two Letters from Mr. J. Hillier, dated Cape Corse, Jan. 3. 16878. and Apr. 25. 1688. Wrote to the Reverend Dr. Bathurst, President of Trinity Colledge, Oxon; giving an Account of the Customs of the Inhabitants, the Air, &c. of that Place, together with an Account of the Weather there from Nov. 24. 1686. to the same Day 1687. Cape Corse, Jan. 3. 1687/8. I Thought the Custom of destroying Slaves at the Death of Great People had been abolish'd and I was so inform'd; but we have seen that it is not; for Oct. 3. this Year, dyed Ahen Penin Ashrive, King of Feton, here at Cape Corse, where he had been long sick; the Fetishers had done all they could to save his Life, which was nothing at all to purpose; their Physick scarce extends to any thing but the Flux, and what we call the French Disease; his was a Consumption and an Asthma (if I mistake not the Word) of a great continuance: so they fled to the Aid of their Religion, and according it seems to the Rules of that, they made several Pellets of Clay, which they set in his Room, in Rank and File,all sprinkled with blood; besides the several Muttons which they eat to his good Health. But that was of too little Force; so the Man dyed, having delivered his Sword to the Dy, who in the Interregnum was to be the principal Man, for the Kingdom is Elective, contrary to what we wrote before, and commanding him to be constant to the English, of whom himself had been a great Favourer, with a Threat, if he was not, of hanting him I i i i i 2 after (688) after his Death; he also appointed one of his Wives, whom he thought worthy of that unlucky Honour, to accompany him to the other World; the next Day he was carryed to Feton, and buried there, Nov. 2. with the poor Woman we spoke of. Presently after, they that were considerable, or had a mind to seem so, sent in them that they had a mind to Murder in Honour of the King: how many there were 'tis hard to say, the highest Account gives 90, the lowest 50, the middle 70; the Blacks do not understand Arithmetick, so the Numbers they give in all cases are very uncertain. I think there were about Eight from this Town, which will not hold Proportion to the highest rate; but 'tis like near Feton there might be more. They say also, that many more will follow at half a Years distance from his Death. The manner of the Exectuion of these poor Creatures, I have not yet learnt, only that they make them drink and dance, with a great deal of Bravery all the beginning of the Day, and toward Night cut off their Heads, but whether by that they mean the common way of their Executions, I am yet to seek. After the King's Funeral, the next thing was to chuse a Successor; so the People was called together at Feton (I suppose by the Authority of the Dy) without inquiring any thing of their Freehold; they pitched upon Mr. Dy, though he were not of the Blood-Royal; the Reason was, as they said, because he had Power enough to do what he pleas'd, and they could do nothing against him; but he refused the Honour because of the Charge 'twould put him to, and proposed the Brother of the deceased King: So the Business stuck some time, but at last 'twas accorded, and he [King Ashrive's Brother] declared King, Nov. 18. his Name is Ahenaco. 'Tis Wonder how they could dispatch such a Business, with so little Disturbance; but I suppose there was no con(689) considerable Number that dissented; otherwise it would scarce have been determined without Blood.shed; for it would scarce have been possible for them to have taken any Pole. I said, 'twas doubt whether these Sacrifices dyed after the rate of their ordinary Executions; if you would know that, thus it is, the Creature that is condemn'd, is made to drink abundance of Palm-Wine, and to dance, every body that will, in the mean time striking or pushing him, when that is over, as is said, he is thrown down, his Face into the Sand, which whether it stifle him or not, I can't tell, then his Legs are cut off below the Knees, and his Arms below the Elbow, afterward his Thigh, and his Arms below the Shoulder, lastly his Head. A Man would not expect any thing more barbarous than this; yet there is a Custom which has something worse; when any one has new Drums or Trumpets, 'tis necessary that they be consecrated with Humane Blood: I have known but one happen of this Kind, that was Jan. 7. 1686/7. when after the Man had been executed after the former rate, about Eight in the Morning; at one in the Afternoon, they drank Palm-Wine out of the upper part of his Skull, and this in the sight of all the Factors at Cape Corse. I remember for the Unhealthiness of the Place, you proposed to inquire if it were Woody, and if any good might be done to it by cutting down the Woods, as has happen'd in many American Plantations; of that Matter this is what I can say: The Shore lies almost East and West, expos'd to the Sea wholly upon the South, the Country is Hilly, the Hills not very high, but thick, clustering together, the Valleys between extream narrow, the whole in a manner cover'd with certain Shrubs,low,but very thick,what the People (690) People Till, comes not to above a Tenth part of their Ground; and where they do Till, it hinders not that within half a Year the Ground is over-grown as before, for they do not root up the Shrubs, but only cut, or sometimes burn them somewhat close to the Earth, so they spring again in a very little time; this is sufficient for their planting the Corn, which they do by making little Holes in the Earth at a competent Distance, and putting Seeds into them. It may be that if those Shrubs were destroyed, the Matter might be mended, which yet is not to be hop'd for, but by bringing the People to some kind of Industry, and that will not be easy; they are so wholly given to Laziness, and so entirely bred up in it, that there must be the greatest Change imaginable, before they become any whit tolerable; a Man may see their Temper by this, that though their Tillage be very easy, and the Earth yields many Hundreds for One, yet so little is the use they make of it, that one scarce Year brings them to danger of Starving, and though there be People enough, and every Man has Power of choosing what he will, that is not already till'd by some other, yet not the Tenth Part, as we have said, is imployed: So that a Man would wonder what came in the French Man's Head to fancy them Industrious; but subtile they are, and diligent to cheat any Man that is not cautious enough to avoid it. So that the Fault of the Wood is (by the Laziness of the People) without any Remedy. But there may be something in the Earth it self; the Water which they have here in Pits (Rain Water for the most part, but yet strain'd through the Earth) has a kind of Taste mixt of Sweet and Subacid, if I understand what I say, I am told 'tis of Vitriol, whether that be mischievous, you know better than I do. But (691) But I take this for certain, since I have had it from good Hands, that at Whiddah, which is one of the most unhealthy Places in Guiney, but 'tis not upon the Goldcoast, he that opens the Ground, though it be but to dig a Grave, runs the hazard of his Life: So mischievous are the Steams from thence arising. It's possible there may be some such Steams here, only not so violent; though in England, I think, a Gravel or a Sand (which here are always uppermost for as much as I have seen) are esteem'd very wholesom Soils; under them is a kind of whitish Marle almost like Fullers Earth. For the Air, except what I have said before, I do not know what Fault it has; 'tis extream hot, 'tis also subtile and piercing, and I believe enters a Man's Body easier than that in England. It has been clearer than that uses to be one Day with another, even this last Year, which has been the wettest and most cloudy which has happened a long time; I think to give you an Account of the Weather in it,as soon as I have time to transcribe. For the Age of the Inhabitants, 'tis very uncertain, because none of them keep an account of it; there are some of them very Grey, but if the Country be to them unhealthy, Grey Hairs may come early: I think there be many more Funerals here than at Oxford, though that be a much larger Place, especially in the Rain times, which to us are always healthful. I think that much of the Mortality (not all) that happens among Strangers, is the Effect of their ill Diet and ill Government of themselves; for they eat but little, having neither Stomach nor Money to buy what they want; but they drink excessively, being for that more readily trusted, and of Liquors very hot and Spirituous; and if any chuse the cold rather, his Stomach is chil'd and he is in danger of a Flux or an extream Looseness, and that immediately. There (692) There is another thing, Men guard themselves less from the Air than in any other Places, trusting to the Heat of the Climate, and receive the cool of the Evening with only a Shirt. Now I think that the Air,though not so cold, is much more subtle and piercing here, than in our Country, it corrodes Iron much more, notby the Moisture, for it is not so moist, and besides it does it in the dry Weather too. Perhaps there are some other Effects to evidence the same thing; besides that, the Diet which most Men procure, is not extraordinary, and the passing by Canoes from one Place to another has a Danger in it beside that of the Sea. Cape Corse, Apr. 25. 1688. I Promised in my last to give you an Account of the Weather at Cape Corse for the last Year, which Account I have inclosed in this; it is as exact as I could give; 'tis a thing which has been very little observed, whether it deserves to be more, I do not know. That Year has had the most Rain of any that can be here remember'd; yet the Mortality was much less than the Years before; so that perhaps Wet is not that which makes the Country unhealthy; though we had very many sick, especially in June and July, whose Diseases were not Mortal. If you give your self the Trouble to read the inclosed, you will find often mention of a Tornada, which is a violent Storm of Wind, followed commonly by Rain, but not always; the Wind ceases not presently upon the Rain, but after sometimes it does: In this Place it comes (as does an Hermitan) most frequently from the North, taking in the next Points, whether to the East or West, but chiefly the East, though I have seen both that and an Hermitan from other Points; so the Account is not without Exception; there are in it short, uncertain Blasts from all Quarters,which I believe reach not many Yards, but (693) but the general Wind (for ought that I see) is not so unconstant; Vessels that go to Windward are help'd by them, when they are not over strong, for they are opposite to the Sea Brize, and they can steer by them a regular Course; which sure they could not do, if they were very irregular. They never fail to give warning before hand, though sometimes after that warning they do not follow; there is a very black Cloud appears afar, in which if there be a kind of white Spot, the Wind will be most, if not the Rain; this the Sailors say. Sometimes there is that Mark, sometimes not, though I doubt the Prediction from it is not very certain; as neither are any perhaps of that kind.
