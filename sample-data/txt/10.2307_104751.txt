Mr. Henry Baker F. R. S. to the President, containing an Extract of a Letter from Mr. W. Arderon F. R. S. concerning an Explosion in the Air, heard at Norwich, June 7. 1750. S I R, MR. Arderon writes me Word from Norwich, that, on Thursday last, the 7th instant, as he and a Friend were walking to take the Air, a little to the Westward of that City, they heard, about 7 o' Clock in the Evening, a kind of hollow Noise, as loud as that of a large Cannon. Which Noise was once repeated nigh the same Place as an Echo, and then continued dying as it were away for about half a Minute. They saw no Lightning, nor any Clouds, except a few thin whitish ones in the Western Horizon. It was heard, he says, by great Numbers of People in the City of Norwich, notwithstanding the continual 5 [699] continual Noise and Hurry there: He likewise received Accounts of it from Swanthorpe, 6 Miles S W; and from Racka, 4 Miles N E of that City, agreeing with the above Description. He has not heard that any Person observed any Tremor of the Earth; and confesses his own Surprize was so great, he does not know whether there was or not. Mr. Wilson, a Gentleman who was with him, thought the Noise much resembled the Fall of a great Building; and a Gentleman at Norwich described it like a large Weight falling down upon a Chamber-floor over his Head. I received the above Account last Monday; and as this Year has been productive of many unusual Phaenomena, I hope you will excuse my laying this before you amongst the rest. I am, S I R, Catherine-Street, Your most obedient Servant, June 14. 1750. H. Baker. U u u u 2 XLV.
