1 '53 1 XI. Observations made with the invariable pendulum (No. 4. JONES), at the Royal Observatory, Cape of Good Hope, for the purpose of determining the compression of the earth. By the REV. FEARON FALLOWS, F.R.S. Astronomer of the Cape Observatory. Communicated by the Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty. Read February 18, 1830. THE important problem of ascertaining the ellipticity of the earth has, for a long time past, drawn forth the talents and labours of some of the most scientific men in Europe; and it still continues to be deemed an object of especial regard by all who feel an interest in the promotion of natural knowledge. To attempt to depict the strenuous exertions, the innumerable fatigues, the ardour for the improvement of science, which actuated so many illustrious persons in endeavouring to discover the true figure of the earth, would only be a waste of time; as learned Societies have always recognised and stamped the due meed of merit to each, and invariably appreciated and published to the world the valuable results which have with so many difficulties been obtained. The nations of Europe, emulous of each other in a work which particularly distinguishes the acquirements of modern times, have encouraged and laudably given their protection and sanction to eminent individuals engaged in undertakings so conducive to the honour of an enlightened community. Whatever difference of opinion may exist as to the respective values to be attached to observations in the admeasurement of an arc of the meridian, or by the variation in the lengths of the seconds pendulum made in different latitudes, there can be no doubt that the former has this paramount advantage; that certain fixed points are determined, by which the geography of a country is considerably promoted, and at length brought as nearly as possible to perfection: whilst the latter method possesses a superiority in being able to concentrate under the immediate eye of the observer the results MDCCCXXX. X 154 REV. F. FALLOWS'S OBSERVATIONS WITH AN INVARIABLE of his inquiries, which are readily obtained, and easily performed and accomplished. The Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty having furnished this observatory with the invariable pendulum (No. 4. JONEs), which had for several years been most strictly examined by Captain SABINE at Mr. BROWNE'S, in Portland Place, London, and subsequently by the same learned gentleman in the course of his inquiries in different parts of the earth, I wished at the earliest opportunity to have a series of experiments made upon it, which might unite every possible degree of accuracy on the part of the observers, as well as the utmost stability in the structure intended for supporting the pendulum. From many unforeseen circumstances, I found at length that the completion of this observatory would be delayed for a considerable time, though previously I had, too fondly perhaps, anticipated finishing it at a much earlier period; and I therefore took advantage of a small out-house (then of no further use) within a short distance of the building, to erect a stout brick pier, well bonded, for the support of the small transit instrument; the same which I used in forming my catalogue of 273 southern stars reduced to the beginning of 1824. Temporary chases were made for meridian observations; and the recess for the clock (MOLYNEUX'S *) and pendulum was soon constructed in a most substantial manner within a few feet of the transit. The top of this recess consisted of a thick strong Robben-Island stone, perforated in the middle, and chiselled out at the upper part, for the reception of the brass plate containing the agate planes upon which the knife-edges of the pendulum rest. This plate was securely fastened to the stone with cement; and I found that when the agates were once truly adjusted to level, they remained (with one exception only, and I think this might be attributed to some error in one of the small levels,) during the whole of the observations that succeeded. It is hardly worthy of remark that at the end of each day's work the knife-edges were screwed up from the agates, and remained so till the commencement of another series on the first favourable opportunity. The clock (adjusted to sidereal time and corrected for rate by the stars,) was placed in the recess, having the bottom of the case resting upon a large block of stone embedded in well-wrought clay, and the back of the case was tightly screwed to a strong piece of well seasoned * The new clock, not the old one. PENDULUM AT THE ROYAL OBSERVATORY, CAPE OF GOOD HOPE. 155 wood let into the wall. I have little doubt but that the good going of the clock was by these means in a great measure secured. On each side of the pendulum, somewhat above the middle of it, were suspended two of JONES'S thermometers. The disk was formed of a small circle of card paper about three-tenths of an inch in diameter, this measure being found to be the best and most convenient. Instead of the wooden stand for supporting the small telescope, through which the coincidences, or rather the disappearances and re-appearances of the pendulum-rod and the disk are noted, as well as the magnitude of the arc of vibration, a small thick brick pier was raised so as to receive the plate to which the telescope is attached. The usual adjustments of the clock, pendulum and telescope, being completed, we were now ready to commence. I here deem it right to notice the very able assistance which I received from Captain RONALD: his exertions were truly praiseworthy ; I cannot recommend them too highly. I likewise avail myself of paying a just tribute to the aid which was afforded by Lieutenant JOHNSON, of the Honourable East India Company's Service, now superintendant of the observatory at St. Helena. This gentleman being on a visit to me, very kindly at my request took an active part in all the observations. The sheets accompanying this short paper must be considered as the united labours of Captain RONALD, Mr. JOHNSON, and myself, and the responsibility of each as to accuracy must depend upon the papers signed with the observer's name. As far as I am able to judge of these things, the near agreement of three independent series of observations is no small argument of their accuracy. It must not for a moment be conceived that I reckon our results as in any way final in the determination of the compression of the earth, inasmuch as it would be advisable to begin a new series of observations (say) in the imidst of winter, or what would be better, in different seasons of the year, lest the coefficient for temperature might require some correction; though even this test can hardly be supposed, from the experiments made by Captain SABINE on this very pendulum in London, to be required. I have ever been of opinion, (how far correct or not, I leave others to judge,) that the invariable pendulum ought x 2 156 REV. F. FALLOWS'S OBSERVATIONS WITH AN INVARIABLE to be a standard instrument in an observatory; that it should be swung at a1l seasons of the year; that it would be proper to forward it on authorized occasions to the various fixed observatories now situated in the northern and southern hemispheres; that the instrument should return again to the same stations as before, and the observations be renewed; that, finally, after each circuit it should undergo a strict examination at the spot where it was first tried, in order that it might proceed again as before. Should any harm take place from improper packing or accidental circumstances, the evil would be soon discovered, and the instrument repaired. The pendulum is of a very delicate construction, and consequently it is the more necessary that it should be as often as possible compared at those points where it has previously been used. Formula used in computing the Observations. a = greater, and b the lesser arc observed at the beginning and end of each set of coincidences. t = mean of the thermometers immediately adjacent to the pendulum.

FEARON FALLOWS. Royal Observatory, Cape of' Good Hope, May 19th, 1829. P. 5. The latitude of the Observatory is not yet ascertained by actual observation with the new mural circle. This instrument has been attached to its pier for several months past; but from some discrepancies in reading, the cause of which is not yet discovered, I am under the necessity of assuming 330 551 561f as a very near approximate latitude*. The examination of the mural will go on, and the conclusions be forwarded home when some definite opinion may be formed of it. * I connected the Observatory with my former temporary one in Cape Town, by a survey over the intermediate ground. 160 REV.

From the tolerable accordance with each other of the pendulum observations of the 21st, it may be presumed that the rate was equable during that day. Abstract of Mr. JOHNSON'S observations.

During the second series, the weather was particularly favourable, both for observations of the transit instrument and pendulum. Cape of Good Hope; Observer Mr. FALLOWS. First Series. Attached Therm.

The observations which Mr. FALLOWS has communicated to the Society in this memoir, having been corrected for buoyancy and expansion, before the volume of the Phil. Trans. had reached the Cape, in which the true value of those corrections is assigned from experiments with a pendulum of the same materials and figure as that employed by Mr. FALLOWS, I have re-computed his results with the correct elements of reduction, and find the retardation of the vibrations at the Cape, compared with those in London, to be 67.15 per diem, instead of 67.12, the difference between Mr. FALLOWS'S calculation and mine amounting only to three hundredths of a vibration per diem. The small amount of the difference, on the employment of the more correct elements of reduction, is an illustration of the remark, with which I concluded the paper on the reduction to a vacuum of an invariable pendulum (Phil. Trans. 1829, page 236.); that in relative experiments, computed before the true reduction to a vacuum was known, and in which a correction for expansion was employed, derived directly from the vibration of the pendulum at the same spot in different temperatures, (as is the case in Mr. FALLOWS'S calculation,) a compensation takes place of the errors of the respective reductions for expansion and resistance, leaving the only uncompensated error in the final result, that arising froin barometric differences, which in all cases of comparison between stations not far removed from the level of the sea, cannot be otherwise than extremely small. In Mr. FALLOWS'S calculation he has taken the rate in London of the invariable pendulum which Captain RONALD took out to the Cape, solely from my observations with it;: if, however, Captain RONALD'S observations with the samne pendulum in London be added to mine, and a true mean be taken corresponding to the number of observations of each observer, the retardation is precisely that stated by Mr. FALLOWS; namely, 67.12 vibrations per diem.
