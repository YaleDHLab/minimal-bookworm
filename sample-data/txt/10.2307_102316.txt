IV. Part of a Letter to Dr. George Garden, giving an Account of the Effects of a very extraordinary Thunder near Aberden in Scotland. SIR, WHen I wrote to you last, I would have give you an Account of the sad Accident that fell out in this place, but I referred it to your Brother the Professor: However, since you are now desirous to have an Account of it, you may take the truest I can give you as followeth: On the 24th of July last, we had an extraordinary pleasant Forenoon, with continual Sun-shine, till about half an Hour after Three in the Afternoon we had some Rain, after which happened two Claps of Thunder, tho' not very great, and then a great Shower of Hail, in which time happened a third Clap which made all our Loss. We were Sixteen in Number, none of us hapning to be out or absent at the time; for my Custom was to have examined their Tasks in the Forenoon, and I used to give them somewhat else in the A a a 2 Af(312) Afternoon till Three, at which time I gave them an Hour for Recreation; so that in order to let them out at the aforesaid time; exactly after we had come in I had joined Two Classes together, causing them to read somewhat of Sladein's Epit. of the Four Monarch. to give them a sight of the Succession, and also somewhat in Geography, of which I usually taught them a Lesson in the Afternoon; so that in Order thereto, the most part of them were standing about me in the School hard by my Chamber Door; The Two foresaid Claps of Thunder being over, we thinking nothing of them; and now there being a great Shower of Hail, on a sudden there happened such a Flash of Lightning which I saw, and as I thought filled the whole House; but of the Clap I mind nothing, but only I think that I heard as it were some sharp clink or sound; but our Neighbours in the Town, such as the Minister and his Wife told, they never heard a lowder: But however, I think all our Loss was by the Fire, which was over in an Instant, and after which we had Darkness in the School, by reason of the Smoak, with a most violent Sulphurous Smell, and the burning of some Leaves of Books. If there were any Bolts I cannot tell, for I have searched diligently, but have found no such thing; there is indeed several Breaches in the Walls, and its even to the Admiration of many, (if Providence had not so ordered) how the School could have stood, for there is Five Breaches in the Walls, to wit, one in the Roof, exactly in shape like a Cannon Ball, another under the Chimney, a third came through the back Wall, and quite through the other Wall opposite to it, and the Chimney was split in pieces, and some that came to the School-door and made a breach there, renting the Stones in pieces, and carried them out: There were Four of us killed, to wit, a Son of James Chiens, and George (313) George Gordons in Ardo and Alvy in the Parroch of Old Deer, with a Brother of my own, and many of the rest hurt, having their Legs or Arms Ruined, but are all, I thank God Recovered; and as for my self, I never was in greater danger, for there was one killed before me, another at my left hand, and not half a Foot from me there was a breach made in the middle Wall of my Chamber, and yet, I thank God I received no hurt, only I was bled in the Mouth, but how I cannot tell; as to the Childrens Bodies that were killed, really I cannot give you so very distinct an Account, for I was a little Confused at the time; but however I lookt them, but found none of their Bones broken, save my Brother had a cut in his Head; and all of them, where they received the Strokes had their Cloaths cut, as if it had been eat out with Rats; they all received their Strokes on their Vital Parts, as about the Shoulders, which were in Colour of a Brownish Black. I repent nothing so much as for burying them so soon, which was the next Morning, for really my Brother keeped a long while a great heat in his Belly, but his other parts were most cold: From the hole at the Roof was James Chiens Son killed, under whom your own Son was pressed when I got him; and yet by God's Providence and great Goodness and Mercy to me in that, for which I will still bless him: For if any thing had happened to your Child, it had been to my sad regret for ever, to the wonder of all preserved. All the Children that were killed were in different places, and as it were even picked out. I cannot stay to tell you the many other Circumstances wherein Providence over-ruled, for they who deny it are grosly mistaken, and if they had seen what I saw, they would be Confuted and Silent for ever.
