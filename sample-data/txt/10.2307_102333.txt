(390) IV. A Relation of a strange Symptom attended an Hydrops Pectoris, and the reason of it, as it appeared on Dissection of the Body. By Mr. Samuel Doudy, F. R. S. MR. Cowper in his Letter Printed in the late Transactions, of an extraordinary large Kidney, occasionally mentioning, that Sighing and difficulty of Respiration are always remarkable Symptoms in an Hydrops Pectoris, put me in mind of the Case of a Noble Peer.
