A Letter from Mr Christopher Maire to the President, containing Observations made at Rome of the Eclipse of the Moon, Dec. 23. 1749; and of that of the Sun, Jan. 8. 1750. Honour'd Sir, I Herewith send you my Observation of the two late Eclipses, to be communicated, if you please, to the Royal Society. The 23d of December, on which happened that of the Moon, was so boisterous a Day, that I despair'd of being able to see it, and for that Reason neglected to put my Micrometer in Order. My Clock had likewise been altered without my Knowledge, on which Account I betook myself too late to the Observation, as will appear by the following Detail. The Place of both Observations is in the Latitude of 41~ 54~ 0~. four Seconds of Time Eastward of St. Peter's. For I take it Read Febr. 1. 1749.
