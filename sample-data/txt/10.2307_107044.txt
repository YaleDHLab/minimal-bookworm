92 11. On the Method of determining, fion the real Probabilities of Lfe, the Values of Contingent fReversions in which three Lives are involved in the Survivorship. By William Morgan, Esq. F.IRS. Read December 12, 1799. ON SURVIVORSHIPS. rfHE several papers which I have had the honour of communicating to the Royal Society, on the doctrine of contingent reversions, contain the greater number of those cases in which three lives are concerned in the survivorship. With the view of completing this subject, I have been induced to investigate the remaining problems; and, having succeeded in the solution of them, I hope the following will not be considered as an improper addition to my former communications. Being anxious to render this paper as concise as possible, I have omitted to state at length the different contingencies on which the payment of the given sum depends; trusting that, from an attentive perusal --of my former demonstrations, these will appear to be so plainly expressed by the several fractions in each problem, as to render a more ample description of them unnecessary. PROBLEM I. To determine the value of a given sum, payable on the death Afr. MORGAN on Survivorshbis 23 of A or B, should either of them be the first or second that fails, of the three lives, A, B. and C. Solution. In this case, the payment of the given sum must certainly take place on tthe extinction of the joint lives of A and B, independent of C, and therefore the value of the reversion will be S . r _. VAB r The fractions expressing the contingencies on which the payment of S depends, in the ist year, are abr x a'. b -ln .cd + a'. -. d +a.c-d .m + b . c d. aa S 5 I acr x abc-mc. a-a', in the 2d year-gr xa m-n , de + a". m m-n. e + all -x de. n + all n Xe + m-n . d e .a a' +a"+m-naa'+a".e+cd.n .a" -it 51 C c-d. m -n a_ a' + a"l + cd. m-n .all -ac, x mc . a a n c. a a' + a"l, and so on in the other years ; hence the whole value is x r -1 .

Let those annuities be respectively denoted by A', A'C', and A'K'; also let p denote the probability that C survives B,* q the number of persons living opposite to the age of A at the end of x years, then will the value of S, after x years, be = tq X r-x ,Vand the whole value of the reversion will be= =S into -x V + ABC A+ +BCx A C AB r 2 z r Tx AIK+BK 92BK + xA F"AhJc+ _jxI+ AP* By the Table, pabe 337, Phil.

But, as these series are to be continued only during C's life, it is evident that the annuities A, B, AB, &c. should also be Continued only during this term; and therefore, if z be the difference between the age of C and the oldest person in the Table, A', B', A'B', &c. the values of annuities respectively on the single and joint lives of A, B, A and B, &c. for z years, these several symbols should be substituted above, in lieu of A, B, AB, &c. to denote the value of the reversion during the first z years.

For, since the possession of this estate is an event which must certainly take place, and the only point to be determined is the time in which it will probably happen, it is obvious that no event can postpone the possession, but the contingency of C's being the second tha t fails, of the three lives. If, therefore, the sum of t'ie valucs of an annuity on the life of B after A, provided A should die before C, and of an annuity on the life of A after B, provided B should die before C, (both found by the problem just mentioned,) be subtracted from the whole value of the reversion after the joint lives of A and B, the remainder vill be the value required. Let X and Y respectively denote the annuities found by problem 1St, (Phil. Trans. Vol. LXXXIV.) then will the general rule expressing the value of an estate be = V AB X + Y, and consequently of a given sum -S r x V AB X + Y, which, when the lives are'equal, may be reduced, as in the former cases, to S r-i xV-(C--CC + CCC. Q. E. D. PROBLEM III. To determine the value of an estate, or of a given sum, after the decease of A or B, should either of them be thefirst or last that shall fail, of the three lives, A, B, and C. Solution. The reversion of the estate in this problem, like that in the* Phil. Trans. for the year 1794, page 235. Mr. MORGAN on Survivorshzips. preceding one, cannot be prevented ultimately from taking place; and there is only the single contingency of C's being the first t~iat fails, of the three lives, which can postpone the possession of it after the extinction of the joint lives. The whole value, therefore, of the reversion, after the joint lives of A and B, must in this case be lessened by the sum of the values of an annuity on A's life after B, provided B should survive C; and of an annuity on B's life after A, provided A should survive C, (both found by the 2d problem in my last Paper.*) Let these two values be respectively denoted by W and Z, then will the general rule expressing the value of an estate e V AB S . r-i W+ Z, and the value of a given sum _ x V-AB -W + Z. When, the lives are all equal, the value of the reversion, by substituting the values of W and Z, becomes V + CC-C--CCC, orr xV + CC --C-CCC, according as it consists of an estate, or a given sulm.

But the computations derived from the addition of those two problems would be too tedious and complicated, and therefore the preceding rules are preferable.

But the rules derived from the foregoing solution are in general more simple than those derived from the two problems just mentioned, and are therefore to be preferred to them. The foregoing problems, together with those which have been investigated in my former papers, comprehend, as far as I can perceive, all the different cases of survivorship between three lives. The great number of contingencies on which these reversions depend, must necessarily render the solutions intricate, and consequently the general rules complicated and laborious. It would not, however, be a difficult task to abridge these rules very considerably, without destroying their accuracy in any great degree; but this would be foreign to my purpose in these papers, which has uniformly been confined to the investigation of the correct values of the different reversions. Nor do I think that such an abridgement is necessary, as the opera'tions of even the longest of the present rules, may be completed .in very nearly as short a time as -the inaccurate approximations which have hitherto been employed for the same purpose. It may not be improper to observe, that the solutions in these papers are not only the first which have ever been deduced, in the case of two and three lives from just principles and the real probabilities of life; but that, as to many of the problems, not even an attempt has ever been made to approximate to the value of the reversion. Being now possessed of correct solutions of all the cases in which two and three lives are involved in the survivorship, we ,are possessed of all that is really useful, and therefore I feel the Mr. MORGAN 'On Survivorsbips. greater satisfaction in closing my inquiries on this subject. For, in regard to contingencies depending on four or more lives, the cases are not only much too numerous and intricate to admit of a solution, but they occur so seldom in practice, as to render the entire investigation of them, were it even possible, a matter of little or no importance.
