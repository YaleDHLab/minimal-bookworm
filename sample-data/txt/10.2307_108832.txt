[ 2635 ] XIV. On the Calculus of Functions. By W. H. L. RUSSELL, Esq., A.B. Communicated by ARTHUR CAYLEY, Esq., F.R.S. Received October 31,-Read December 5, 1861. ONE of the first efforts towards the formation of the Calculus of Functions is due to LAPLACE, whose solution of the functional equation of the first order, by means of two equations in finite differences, is well known. Functional equations were afterwards treated systematically by Mr. BABBAGE; his memoirs were published in the Transactions of this Society, and there is some account of them in Professor BOoLE's Treatise on the Calculus of Finite Differences. A very important functional equation was solved by POISSON in his Memoirs on Electricity; which suggested to me the investigations I have now the honour to lay before the Society. I have commenced by discussing the linear functional equation of the first order with constant coefficients, when the subjects of the unknown functions are rational functions of the independent variable, and have shown how the solution of such equations may in a variety of cases be effected by series, and by definite integrals. I have then considered functional equations with constant coefficients of the higher orders, and have proved that they may be solved by methods similar to those used for equations of the first order. I have next proceeded with the solution of functional equations with variable coefficients. In connexion with functional equations, I have considered equations involving definite integrals, and containing an unknown function under the integral sign; the methods employed for their resolution depend chiefly upon the solution of functional equations, as effected in this paper. The Calculus of Functions has now for a long time engaged the attention of analysts; and I hope that the following investigations will be found to have extended its power and resources. Let the functional equation be , { 42?2fl8 _nx+rx2 }-acp(x)=F(x), where p is an unknown, and F a known function.

We may hence immediately deduce the value of p(x). It is evident that the functional equation Jdacbc+ccI)I(a +.e2 c2) 270 MR. W. H. L. RUSSELL ON THE CALCULUS OF FUNCTIONS. when 4vP and F1 are known functions of (x), may be reduced to the form P1(a+bx+cx2)op'(x) =F(x)4(a+bx+ce2) by making p1(x)= A44)p(X). The second equation has already been considered; it becomes, therefore, interesting to ascertain what equations are included under the form of the first equation, in other words, to consider what forms the algebraical expression Qa+cx2) can possibly take. The following are a few of them: V(x?2 Vac-b) x-a x2-a2 Vax2~ _2bx+b2-4ac V/-a + x/c. ax(b + cx) (2a+ bx+ cz2)x(b + cx)' a-cav2 Many others may, in like manner, be imagined; and the same methods, mutatis mutandis, apply to functional equations of the higher orders with variable coefficients. I now come to the consideration of equations involving definite integrals, when the equation contains an unknown function under the sign of definite integration. Let us take the equation F1 (a) ? F2(a).-x2 F3(c) + F4(a)i + F(a). dx4 (x) F(a), where p(x) is an unknown function of (x) not containing (a), F1(c), F2Q()..*, F5Q() rational functions of (a) which is supposed to vary independently of (x), to determine P(x). Suppose the equation can be written in the form (1Il A(x)dx I '-(x(+))2 + (1_2) l X v 1-x2 12XL%(1-2x2) ? (xa)2 1-2a(1-2x2) + a2 ) where '(x)=((x)V1 X2. Let x:sin and the equation reduces to $Sd(sin 2) {l -XI cos 0 + 1-2a cos O+a2 or if S7r (1 a2)A (sin A) dI -2cc cos Oa we find Suppose the solution of this equation be determined by the former investigations to be then (I 1a2) Ax sin 2) J1-2cos+ f() Assume X sin A =a?a1 cos O~a2 cos 20+a3 cos 30+..., MR.

Similar treatment will of course apply to the equation 0X F(a) + F221 + (a )'+ . .7 but the functional equation employed for its solution (when possible by this method) will be of a higher order. Let us, lastly, consider the equation So Fj(x)p(x-+(a))=F(%)j to find p, where Flx is a known function of (x) not containing (a), and (a) varies independently of (x). Let +(a)=f, then as4-'f3, and the equation becomes 0S F1(x)p(xf3)p F.=(Y3) .
