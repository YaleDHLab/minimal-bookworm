[ 61 ] III. On the Mechanical Equivalent of Heat. By JAMES PRESCOTT JOULE, F.C.S., Sec. Lit. and Phil. Society, Manchester, Cor. Mem. R.A., Turin, 8Sc. Communicated by MICHAEL FARADAY, D.C.L., F.R.S., Foreign Associate of the Academy of Sciences, Paris, &Jc. &Jc. &ic. Received June 6,-Read June 21, 1849. "Heat is a very brisk agitation of the insensible parts of the object, which produces in us that sensation from whence we denominate the object hot; so what in our sensation is heat, in the object is nothing but motion."-LoCKE. "The force of a moving body is proportional to the square of its velocity, or to the height to which it would rise against gravity. "-LEIBNITZ. IN accordance with the pledge I gave the Royal Society some years ago, I have now the honouir to present it with the results of the experiments I have made in order to determine the mechanical equivalent of heat with exactness. I will commence with a slight sketch of the progress of the mechanical doctrine, endeavouring to confine myself, for the sake of conciseness, to the notice of such researches as are immediately connected with the subject. I shall not therefore be able to review the valuable labours of Mr. FORBES and other illustrious men, whose researches on radiant heat and other subjects do not come exactly within the scope of the present memoir. For a long time it had been a favourite hypothesis that heat consists of " a force or power belonging to bodies*," but it was reserved for Count RUMFORD to make the first expelri ments decidedly in favour of that view. That justly celebrated natural philosopher demonstrated by his ingenious experiments that the very great quantity of heat excited by the boring of cannon could not be ascribed to a change taking place in the calorific capacity of the metal; and hie therefore concluded that the motion of the borer was communicated to the particles of metal, thus producing the phenomena of heat:-" It appears to me," lie remarks, " extremely difficult, if not quite im possible, to form any distinct idea of anythling, capable of being excited and communicated, in the manner the heat was excited and communicated in these experiments, except it be mnotion+." One of the most important parts of Count RUMFORI'S paper, though one to which* Crawford on Animal Heat, p. 15. t " An Inquiry concerning the Source of the Heat which is excited by Friction." Phil. Trans. Abridged, vol. xviii. p. 286. 62 MR. JOULE ON THE MECHANICAL EQUIVALENT OF HEAT. little attention has hitherto been paid, is that in which he makes an estimate of the quantity of mechanical force required to produce a certain amount of heat. Referring to his third experiment, he remarks that the " total quantity of ice-cold water which, with the heat actually generated by friction, and accumulated in 211 30m, might have been heated 180?, or made to boil,=26-58 lbs." * In the next page he states that "the machinery used in the experiment could easily be carried round by the force of one horse (though, to render the work lighter, two horses were actually employed in doing it)." Now the power of a horse is estimated by WATT at 33,000 foot-pounds per minute, and therefore if continued for two hours and a half will amount to 4,950,000 foot-pounds, which, according to Count RUMFORD'S experiment, will be equivalent to 26,58 lbs. of water raised 180'. Hence the heat required to raise a lb. of water i? will be equivalent to the force represented by 1034 foot-pounds. This result is not very widely different from that which I have deduced from my own experiments related in this paper, viz. 772 foot-pounds; and it must be observed that the excess of Count RUMFORD'S equivalent is just such as might have been anticipated from the circumstance, which he himself mentions, that "no estimate was made of the heat accumulated in the wooden box, nor of that dispersed during the experiment." About the end of the last century Sir HUMPHRY DAVY communicated a paper to Dr. BEDDOES' West Country Contributions, entitled, "Researches on Heat, Light and Respiration," in which he gave ample confirmation to the views of Count RumFORD. By rubbing two pieces of ice against one another in the vacuum of an airpump, part of them was melted, although the temperature of the receiver was kept below the freezing-point. This experiment was the more decisively in favour of the doctrine of the immateriality of heat, inasmuch as the capacity of ice for heat is much less than that of water. It was therefore with good reason that DAVY drew the inference that "the immediate cause of the phenomena of heat is motion, and the laws of its communication are precisely the same as the laws of the communication of motion+." The researches of DULONG on the specific heat of elastic fluids were rewarded by the discovery of the remarkable fact that " equal volumes of all the elastic fluids, taken at the same temperature, and under the same pressure, being compressed or dilated suddenly to the same fraction of their volume, disengage or absorb the same absolute quantity of heat+." This law is of the 1utrDost importance in the development of the theory of heat, inasmuch as it proves that the calorific effect is, under certain conditions, proportional to the force expended. In 1834 Dr. FARADAY demonstrated the " Identity of the Chemical and Electrical Forces." This law, along with others subsequently discovered by that great man, showing the relations which subsist between magnetism, electricity and light, have* " An Inquiry concerning the Source of the Heat which is excited by Friction."

JOULE ON THE MECHANICAL EQUIVALENT OF HEAT. 63 enabled him to advance the idea that the so-called imponderable bodies are m erely the exponents of different forms of Force. Mr. GROVE and M. MAYER have also given their powerful advocacy to similar views. My own experiments in reference to the subject were commenced in 1840, in which year I communicated to the Royal Society my discovery of the law of the heat evolved by voltaic electricity, a law from which the immediate deductions were drawn,-lst, that the heat evolved by any voltaic pair is proportional, cwteris paribus, to its intensity or electromotive force*; and 2nd, that the heat evolved by the combustion of a body is proportional to the intensity of its affinity for oxygent. I thus succeeded in establishing relations between heat and chemical affinity. In 1843 I showed that the heat evolved by magneto-electricity is proportional to the force absorbed; and that the force of the electromagnetic engine is derived from the force of chemicals affinity in the battery, a force which otherwise would be evolved in the form of heat: from these facts I considered myself justified in announcing "that the quantity of heat capable of increasing the temperature of a lb. of water by one degree of FAHRENHEIT'S scale, is equal to, and may be converted into, a mechanical force capable of raising 838 lbs. to the perpendicular height of one foot.+" In a subsequent paper, read before the Royal Society in 1844, 1 endeavoured to show that the heat absorbed and evolved by the rarefaction and condensation of air is proportional to the force evolved and absorbed in those operations?. The quan.titative relation between force and heat deduced from these experiments, is almost identical.with that derived from the electro-magnetic experiments just referred to, and is confirmed by the experiments of M. SEGUIN on the dilatation of steam 11. From the explanation given by Count RUMFORD of the heat arising from the frictionI of solids, one might have anticipated, as a matter of course, that the evolution of heat would also be detected in the friction of liquid and gaseous bodies. Moreover there were many facts<, such as, for instance, the warmth of the sea after a few days of stormy weather, which had long been commonly attributed to fluid friction. Nevertheless the scientific world, preoccupied with the hypothesis that heat is a substance, and following the deductions diawn by PICTET from experiments not sufliciently delicate, have almost unanimously denied the possibility of generating heat in that way. The first mention, so far as I am aware, of experiments in which the evolution of heat from fluid friction is asserted, was in 1842 by M. MAYER?T, who states that he has raised the temperature of water from 120 C. to 130 C., by agitating it, without however indicating the quantity of force employed, or the precautions taken to secure a correct result. In 1843 I announced the fact that " heat is evolved by the passage of water through narrow tubes**," and that each degree of heat per lb. of water required for its evolution in this way a mechanical force represented by* Phil.

Subsequently, in 1845* and 1847t, I employed a paddle-wheel to produce the fluid friction, and obtained the equivalents 781", 782A1 and 787'-6, respectively, from the agitation of water, sperm-oil and [nercury. Results so closely coinciding with one another, and with those previously derived from experiments with elastic fluids and the electro-magnetic machine, left no doubt on my mind as to the existence of an equivalent relation between force and heat; but still it appeared of the highest importance to obtain that relation with still greater accuracy. This I have attempted in the present paper. Description of Apparatus.-The thermometers employed had their tubes calibrated and graduated according to the method first indicated by M. REGNAULT. Two of them, which I shall designate by A and B, were constructed by Mr. DANCER of Manchester; the third, designated by C, was made by M. FASTRE of Paris. The graduation of these instruments was so correct, that when compared together their indications coincided to about h th of a degree FAHR. I also possessed another exact instrument made by Mr. DANCER, the scale of which embraced both the freezing and boilingpoints. The latter point in this standard thermometer was obtained, in the usual manner, by immersing the bulb and stem in the steam. arising from a considerable .quantity of pure water in rapid ebullition. During the trial the barometer stood at 29,94 inches, and the temperature of the air was 500; so that the observed point required very little correction to reduce it to 0'760 metre and O0 C., the pressure used in France, and I believe the Continent generally, for determining the boiling-point, and which has been employed by me on account of the number of accurate thermometrical researches which have been constructed on that basist. The values of the scales of thermometers A and B were ascertained by plunging them along with the standard in large volumes of water kept constantly at various temperatures. The value of the scale of thermometer C was determined by comparison with A. It was thus found that the number of divisions corresponding to 10 FAHR. in the thermnometers A. B and C, were 12,95 1, 9-829 and 1 1P647, respectively. And since constant practice had enabled me to read off with the naked eye to -1-th of a division, it followed that -lth of a degree FAHR. was an appreciable temperature. Plate VII. fig. 1 represents a vertical, and fig. 2 a horizontal plan of the apparatus emnployed for producing the friction of water, consisting of a brass paddle-wheel furnished with eight sets of revolving armns,afa,&c., working between four sets of stationary vanes,1* Phil. Mag., vol. xxvii. p. 205. t Ibid. vol. xxxi. p. 17:3, and Comptes Rendus, tome xxv. p. 309. + A barometrical pressure of 30 inches of mercury at 600 is very generally employed in this country, and fortunately agrees almost exactly with the continental standard. In the " Report of the Committee appointed by the Royal Society to consider the best method of adjusting the Fixed Points of Thermometers," Philosophical Transactions, Abridged, xiv. p. 258, the barometrical pressure 29 8 is recommended, but the temperature is not named, a remarkable omission in a work so exact in other respects. -zi.>Z. 7 .MCCCM.D C C C. -P. 64. k a hi~ ~ ~ I>' i) (t. b#< Z.?~~_ -s _ ri l. ,,a=C. 6~cca On (2zza J! -ta a F'oot-. 7/'r 7(Z/ (277n 7l/C/ae 71EC'X(4A/G/7l( /7/t/1i't/>U/(/// -f i/'Z >J7aar St ai/ AIR.

The brass axis of the paddlewheel worked freely, but without shaking, on its bearings at c, c, and at d was divided into two parts by a piece of boxwood intervening, so as to prevent the conduction of heat in that direction. Fig. 3 represents the copper vessel into which the revolving apparatus was firmly fitted: it had a copper lid, the flange of which, furnished with a very thin washer of leather saturated with white-lead, could be screwed perfectly water-tight to the flange of the copper vessel. In the lid there were two necks, a, b, the former for the axis to revolve in without touching, the latter for the insertion of the thermometer. Besides the above I had a similar apparatus for experiments on the friction of mercury, which is represented by figs. 4, 5 and 6. It differed from the apparatus already described in its size; number of vanes, of which six were rotary and eight sets stationary; and material, which was wrought iron in the paddle-wheel, and cast iron in the vessel and lid. Being anxious to extend my experiments to the friction of solids, I also procured the apparatus represented by fig. 7, in which a a is the axis revolving along with the beveled cast-iron wheel b, the rim of which was turned true. By means of the lever c, which had a ring in its centre for the axis to pass through, and two short arms d, the bevel turned cast-iron wheel e could be pressed against the revolving wvheel; the degree of force applied being regulated by hand by means of the wooden lever / attached to the perpendicular iron rod g. Fig. 8 represents the apparatus in its cast-iron vessel. Fig. 9 is a perspective view of the machinery employed to set the frictional apparatus just described in motion. a a are wooden pulleys, 1 foot in diameter and 2 inches thick, having wooden rollers bb, bb, 2 inches in diameter, and steel axles cc, cc, one quarter of an inch in diameter. The pulleys were turned perfectly true and equal to one another. Their axles were supported by brass friction wheels dddd, dddd, the steel axles of which worked in holes drilled into brass plates attached to a very strong wooden framework firmly fixed into the walls of the apartment*. The leaden weights e, e, which in some of the ensuing experiments weighed about 29 lbs., and in others about 10 lbs. a piece, were suspended by string from the rollers bb, b b; and fine twine attached to the pulleys a a, connected them with the central rollerf, which, by means of a pin, could with facility be attached to, or removed from, the axis of the frictional apparatus. The wooden stool g, upon which the frictional apparatus stood, was perforated by a number of transverse slits, so cut out that only a very few points of wood came in contact with the metal, whilst the air had free access to almost every part of it. In this way the conduction of heat to the substance of the stool was avoided. * This was a spacious cellar, which had the advantage of possessing an uniformity of temperature far supe. rior to that of any other laboratory I could have used. NIDcccL. K 66 MR. JOULE ON THE MECHANICAL EQUIVALENT OF HEAT. A large wooden screen (not represented in the figure) completely obviated the effects of radiant heat firom the person of the experimenter. The method of experimenting was simply as follows:-The temperature of the frictional apparatus having been ascertained and the weights wound up with the assistance of the stand h, the roller was refixed to the axis. The precise height of the weights above the ground having then been determined by means of the graduated slips of wood k, k, the roller was set at liberty and allowed to revolve until the weights reached the flagged floor of the laboratory, after accomplishing a fall of about 63 inches. The roller was then removed to the stand, the weights wound up again, and the friction renewed. After this had been repeated twenty times, the experirnent was concluded with another observation of the temperature of the apparatus. Trhe mean temperature of the laboratory was determined by observations made at the commencement, middle and termination of each experiment. Previously to, or immediately after each of the experiments, I made trial of the effect of radiation and conduction of heat to or from the atmosphere, in depressing or raising the temperature of the frictional apparatus. In these trials, the position of the apparatus, the quantity of water contained by it, the time occupied, the method of observing the thermometers, the position of the experimenter, in short everything, with the exception of the apparatus being at rest, was the same as in the experiments in which the effect of friction was observed. 1st Series of Experiments.-Friction of Water.

JOULE ON THE MECHANICAL EQUIVALENT OF HEAT. 69 From the various experiments in the above Table in which the effect of radiation was observed, it may be readily gathered that the effect of the temperature of the surrounding air upon the apparatus was, for each degree of difference between the mean temperature of, the air and that of the apparatus, 0? 04654. Therefore, since the excess of the temperature of the atmosphere over that of the apparatus was 0? 32295 in the mean of the radiation experiments, but only 0? 305075 in the mean of the fiiction experiments, it follows that 00 000832 must be added to the difference between 00`57525 and 0-0012975, and the result, 0? 5631 07, will be the proximate heating effect of the friction. But to this quantity a small correction must be applied on account of the mean of the temperatures of the apparatus at the commencement and termination of each friction experiment having been taken for the true mean temperature, which was not strictly the case, owing to the somewhat less rapid increase of temperature towards the termination of the experiment when the water had become warmer. The mean temperature of the apparatus in the friction experiments ought therefore to be estimated 00.002184 higher, which will diminish the heating effect of the atmlosphere by 00.000102. This, added to 0?-563107, gives 0? 563209 as the true mean increase of temperature due to the friction of water*. In order to ascertain the absolute quantity of heat evolved, it was necessary to find the capacity for heat of the copper vessel and brass paddle-wheel. That of the former was easily deduced fiom the specific heat of copper according to M. REGNAULT. Thus, capacity of 25541 grs.f of copper X 0 095 15 = capacity of 2430-2 grs. of water. A series of seven very careful experiments with the brass paddle-wheel gave rue 1783 grs. of water as its capacity, after making all the requisite corrections for the heat occasioned by the contact of the water with the surface of the metal, &c. But on account of the magnitude of these corrections, amounting to one-thirtieth of the whole capacity, I prefer to avail myself of M. REGNAULT'S law, viz. that the capacity in metallic alloys is equal to the sum of the capacities of their constituent metals+. Analysis of a part of the wheel proved it to consist of a very pure brass containing 3933 grs. of zinc. to 14968 grs. of copper. Hence Cap. 14968 grs. copper X 0 095 15 =cap. 1424 2 grs. wvater. Cap. 3933 grs. zinc X0 09555 cap. 375'8 grs. water. Total cap. brass wheel = cap. 1800 grs. water.* This increase of temperature was, it is necessary to observe, a mixed quantity, depending partly upon the friction of the water, and partly upon the friction of the vertical axis of the apparatus upon its pivot and bearing, c c, fig. 1. The latter source of heat was however only equal to about -j-th of the former. Similarly also, in the experiments on the friction of solids hereafter detailed, the cast-iron discs revolving in mercury, rendered it impossible to avoid a very small degree of friction among the particles of that fluid. But since it was found that the quantity of heat evolved was the same, for the same quantity of force expended, in both cases, i. e. whether a minute quantity of heat arising from friction of solids was mixed with the heat arising from the friction of a fluid, or whether, on the other hand, a minute quantity of heat arising from the friction of a fluid was mingled with the heat developed by the friction of solids, I thought there could be no impropriety in considering the heat as if developed from a simple source,-in the one case entirely from the friction of a fluid, and in the other entirely from the friction of a solid body. t The washer, weighing only 38 grs., was reckoned as copper in this estimate. + Ann. de Ch. 1841, t. i. 70 MR. JOULE ON THE MECHANICAL EQUIVALENT OF HEAT. The capacity of a brass stopper which was placed in the neck 1, fig. 3, for the purpose of preventing the contact of air with the water as much as possible, was equal to that of 103 grs. of water: the capacity of the thermometer had not to be estimated, because it was always brought to the expected temperature before immersion. The entire capacity of tahe apparatus was therefore as follows Water .. 932291 Copper as water. . . 2430 2 Brass as water . . . 1810*3 Total . . 97470 2 So that the total quantity of heat evolved was 0` 563209 in 97470#2 grs. of water, or, in other words, I FAHR. in 7-842299 lbs. of water. The estimate of the force applied in generating this heat may be made as follows: -The weights amounted to 406152 grs., from which must be subtracted the friction arising from the pulleys and the rigidity of the string; which was found by connecting the two pulleys with twine passing round a roller of equal diameter to that employed in the experiments. Under these circumstances, the weight required to be added to one of' the leaden weights in order to maintain them in equable motion was found to be 2955 grs. The same result, in the opposite direction, was obtained by addinu 3055 grs. to the other leaden weight. Deducting 168 grs., the friction of the roller on its pivots, from 3005, the mean of the above numbers, we have 2837 grs, as the amount of friction in the experiments, which, subtracted from the leaden weights, leaves 403315 grs. as the actual pressure applied. The velocity with which the leaden weights came to the ground, viz. 2*42 inches per second, is equivalent to an altitude of 0 0076 inch. This, multiplied by 20, the number of times the weights were wound up in each experiment, produces 0152 inch, which, subtracted from 1260{248, leaves 1 260'096 as the corrected mean height from which the weights fell. This fall, accompanied by the above-mentioned pressure, represents a force equivalent to 6050 186 lbs. through one foot; and 0 8464 X 20= -16928 foot-lbs. added to it, for the force developed by the elasticity of the string after the weights had touched the ground, gives 6067' 114 foot-pounds as the mean corrected force. 6067'114 Hence 67842299 = 773-64 foot-pounds, will be the force which, according to the above experiments on the friction of water, is equivalent to I 0FAHR. in a lb. of water. 2nd Series of Experiments.-Friction of Mercury.

JOULE ON THE MECHANICAL EQUIVALENT OF HEAT. From the above Table, it appears that the effect of each degree of difference between the temperature of the laboratory and that of the apparatus was 00?13742. Hence 20A41395+000657+00?007654=2?-487304, will be the proximate value of the increase of temperature in the experiments. The further correction on account of the mean temperature of the apparatus in the friction experiments having been in reality 00.028484 higher than is indicated by the table, will be 00.003914, which, added to the proximate result, gives 2?-491218 as the true thermometrical effect of the friction of the mercury. In order to obtain the absolute quantity of heat evolved, it was requisite to ascertain the capacity for heat of the apparatus. I therefore caused it to be suspended by iron wire from a lever so contrived that the apparatus could be moved with rapidity and ease to any required position. The temperature of the apparatus having -then been raised about 200, it was placed in a warm air-bath, in order to keep its temperature uniform for a quarter of an hour, during which time the thermometer C, immersed in the mercury, was from time to time observed. The apparatus was then rapidly immersed into a thin copper vessel containing 141826 grs. of distilled water, the temperature of which was repeatedly observed by thermometer A. During the experiment the water was repeatedly agitated by a copper stirrer; and every precaution was taken to keep the surrounding atmosphere in a uniform state, and also to prevent the disturbing effects of radiation from the person of the experimenter. In this way I obtained the following results:Time of Temperature Temperature observation. of water. of apparatus. 0 C ?47705 70'518 Apparatus tin air-bath . . . 47-705 70-492 Ltb o47-713 70-518 Instant of immersion. . . . 11 C 13i 49,836 57'673 16 50'49352'641I 1 21 50-694 50'941 Apparatus immersed in water pp ~~~~~26 50-690 50-778 / 31 50'667 50-744 L36 50'636 50709 By applying the correction to the temperature of th ewater due to its observed increase during the first ten minutes of the experiment, and the still smaller correction due to the rise of the water in the can covering 60 square inches of copper at the temperature of the atmosphere, 470.714 was found to be the temperature of the water at the instant of immersion. To remove the apparatus from the warm air-bath, and to immerse it into the water, occupied only 10", during which it must (according to preliminary experiments) have cooled 0" 027. The heating efect of the air-bath MIR. JOULE ON THE MECHANICAL EQUIVALENT OF HEAT. 73 during the remaining 50" (estimated from the rate of increase of temperature between the observations at 5' and 10') will be 00?004. These corrections, applied to 700-518, leave 700?495 as the temperature of the apparatus at the moment of immersion. The temperature of the apparatus at 26' was 500'778, indicating a loss of 190-717. That of the water at the same time of observation, being corrected for the effect of the atmosphere (deduced fioro the observations of the cooling from 26' to 36' and of the heating from 0' to 10'), will be 50?777, indicating a gain of 30.063.

This, in the capacity of 22071*68 grs. of water, is equal to 10 in 2'70548 lbs. of water. The leadenweights amounted to 137326 grs., from which 1040 grs. must be subtracted for the friction of the pulleys, leaving 136286 grs. as the corrected weight.The mlean height of fall was 1293`532 inches, from which 0-047 inch, subtracted on account of the velocity with which the weights came to the ground, leaves 1293,485 inches. -This fall, combined with the above corrected weight, is equivalent to 2098 618 foot-lbs., which, with 1-654 foot-lb., the force developed by the elasticity of the string, gives 2100 272 foot lbs. as the mean force employed in the experiments.20270527 =776'303, will therefore be the equivalent from the above series of ex2_-7O548 76 periments, in which the amount of friction of the mercury was moderated by the use: of lighter weights. 4th Series of Experiments.-Friction of Cast Iron.

The capacity of the apparatus was obtained by experiments made in precisely the same manner that I have already described in the case of the mercurial apparatus for fluid friction.

The capacity of the can of water was in this instance as follows Water .155824 grs. Copper can as water. 1486 grs. Thermometer and stirrer as ditto I 18 grs. Total . . . 157428 grs. Hene 60904 Hence -2143685 X 157428=1 1816A47, will be the capacity of the apparatus as tried. By applying the two corrections, one additive on account of the absence during the trials of 300 grs. of mercury, the other subtractive on account of the capacity of the thermometer C and suspending wire, we obtain 1 1796-07 grs. of water as the capacity of the apparatus during the experiments. The temperature 4`56785 in the above capacity, equivalent to 10 in 7'69753^ lbs. of water, was therefore the mean absolute quantity of heat evolved by the friction of cast iron. The leaden weights amounted to 406099 grs., from which 2857 grs., subtracted on account of the friction of the pulleys, leaves 403242 grs. as the pressure applied to the apparatus. Owing to the friction being in the simple ratio of the velocity, it required a good deal of practice to hold the regulating lever so as to cause the weights to descend to 80 MR. JOULE ON THE MECHANICAL EQUIVALENT OF HEAT. the ground with anything like a uniform and moderate velocity. Hence, although the mean velocity was 3-12 inches per second, the force with which the weights struck the ground could not be correctly estimated by that velocity as in the case of fluid friction. However, it was found that the noise produced by the impact was on the average equal to that produced by letting the weights fall from the height of one-eighth of an inch. It generally happened also that in endeavouring to regulate the motion, the weights would stop suddenly before arriving at the ground. This would generally happen once, sometimes twice, during the descent of the weights, and I estimate the force thereby lost as equal to that lost by impact with the ground. Taking therefore the total loss at one-fourth of an inch in each fall, we have twenty times that quantity, or 5 inches, as the entire loss, which, subtracted from 1260-027, leave 1255-027 inches as the corrected height through which the weight of 403242 grs. operated. These numbers are equivalent to 6024-757 foot-lbs., and adding 16,464 foot-lbs. for the effect of the elasticity of the string, we have 6041L221 foot-lbs. as the force employed in the experiments. The above force was not however entirely employed in generating heat in the apparatus. It will be readily conceived that the friction of a solid body like cast iron must have produced a considerable vibration of the framework upon which the apparatus was placed, as well as a loud sound. The value of the force absorbed by the former was estimated by experiment at 10-266 foot-lbs. The force required to vibrate the string of a violoncello, so as to produce a sound which could be heard at the same distance as that arising from the friction, was estimated by me, with the concurrence of another observer, at 50 foot-lbs. These numbers, subtracted from the previous result, leave 5980-955 foot-lbs. as the force actually converted into heat. 5 90955=776-997, will therefore be the equivalent derived from the above experi7-697.53 ~ ments on the friction of cast iron. The next series of experiments was made with the same apparatus, using lighter weights. 5th Series of Experiments.-Friction of Cast Iron. Weight of leaden weights, 68442 grs. and 68884 grs.

Hence 105102+000223+0o03974=lo57224, will bethe proximate heating effect. To this the addition of 00.00331, on account of the mean temperature of the apparatus in the friction experiments having been in reality 00.02084 higher than appears in the Table, gives the real increase of temperature in the experiments at 1057555, which, in the capacity of 1 1796'07 grs. of water, is equivalent to 10 in 2,65504 Ibs. of water. The leaden weights amounted to 137326 grs., from which 1040 grs., subtracted for the friction of the pulleys, leaves 136286 grs. The velocity of descent, which was in this case much more easily regulated than when the heavier weights were used, was 1.9 inch per second. Twenty impacts with this velocity indicate a loss of fall of 0-094 inch, which, subtracted from 1279-957, leaves 1279-863 inches as the corrected height from which the weights fell. The above height and weight are equivalent to 2076*517 foot-lbes., to which the adldition of P*189 foot-lb. for the elasticity of the string, gives 2077v706 foot-lbs. as the MDCCCL. M 82 MR. JOULE ON THE MECHANICAL EQUIVALENT OF HEAT. total force applied. The corrections for vibration and sound (deduced from the data obtained: in the last series on the hypothesis that they were proportional to the friction by which they were produced) will be 3&47 and 16-9 foot-lbs. These quantities subtracted from the previous result, leave 2057-336 foot-lbs. as the quantity of force converted into heat in the apparatus. 205-75-336 _774-88, will therefore be the equivalent as derived from this last series of experiments. The following Table contains a summary of the equivalents derived from the experiments above detailed. In its fourth column I have supplied the results with the correction necessary to reduce them to a vacuum. TABLE IX.

But since the quantity abraded was not considerable enough to be weighed after the experiments were comnpleted, the error from this source cannot be of mnuch moment. I consider that 772,692, the equivalent derived from the friction of water, is the most correct, both on account of the number of experiments tried, and the great capacity of the apparatus for heat. And since, even in the friction of fluids, i-t was impossible entirely to avoid vibration and the production of a slight sound, it is probable that the above number is slightly in excess. I will therefore conclude by considering it as demnonstrated by the experiments contained in this paper,1st. That the quantity of heat produced by the friction of bodies, whether solid or liquid, is always proportional to the quantity offorce expended. And, 2nd. That the quanti'ty of heatcapable of increasing the temperature of a pound of water (weighed in vacuo, and taken at between 55? and 600) by i? FAHR., requires for its evolution the expenditure of a mechanicalforce represented by the fall of 772 lbs. through the space of one foot. Oak Field, near Manchester, June 4th, 1849.
