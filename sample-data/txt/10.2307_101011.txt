An Account from Paris Concerning a great Metallin Burning Concave, and some of the most considerable Effects of it: Communicated by severall persons upon the place, where Tryals have been made of it. IT is true, that Monsieur de Vilette of Lyons, who formerly made that Burning Concave, * which was of about 30. inches diameter(disposed of to the King of Denmark)hath made another, which is larger, now under tryal here. It is of 34. inches diameter, and melts all sorts of Mettals, and Iron it self of the thickness of a Silver-Crown, in less then a minute of time, and vitrifies Brick in the same time; and as for Wood, whether green or dry, it sets it on fire in a moment. The King hath seen it and the performances of it with great satisfaction; and his Majesty is likely to make it his, and and then to bestow it on his Royal Academy of Philosophers, for making of farther Experiments with it. So far they. Nota Described at large in Numb. 6. of these Transactions. (987) Nota. This kind of Concaves, burning most forcibly of any fire we know of, even beyond that of a Wind-furnace, would be of great use, if they could be so contrived as to have a focus of any considerable largeness, to take in a good quantity of combustible matter at once.
