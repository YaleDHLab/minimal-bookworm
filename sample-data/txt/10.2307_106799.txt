K )YAL SOCIErrY OF J4 * $** >ADVERTISEMENT . THE Committee appointect by the Woyal Sociegy t-o direct the publication of thePh-ilosophical fransactzXons, take this opportunity -to acquaint the Public, that it fuIly appears? as well from the council lvooks and jo-urnals of the Society, as from repeated Eleclarations whicll have been made in several former lCransalczons, that the printirlg of . . them was always, from time to time, tlle single act of the lespective S;ecretaries, tillzthe Forty-seventh Volulne: tile Society, as a Body, nearer interesting themselves a;ny further in their publication, than by occasionally recomm-endirlg the revival of them to some of their Secre-taries, when, from the particlllar circumstances of theiraffairs, the fransactions had happened for any length of tiXme to be internlitted. And this seems principally to have been done with a viewlr to satisfy the Public, that theirusual meetings were then continued, for the imr I)rovement of knowledge, and benefit of mankind, tlle great ends of .tlleir first institution by the Royal Charters, and wvhicll they have ever since steadily pursuedt But theSociety being of late years greatly erllalged, and theit com munications more numerous, it was thougllt advisable, that a Comu mittee oftheirmexnbers should be appointedto leconsiderthepapers read before them, and select out of them stlch as they should judge most proper for publication in the future >>ransactions; whith was accoldlnglydone upon the g6th of SIarch X 1 7s2. And the grounds 2 E.1v3 of their choice are, and will continue to be, tht importance and sin gularity of the subjects, or the advantageous manner oftreating them; without pretending to answer for the certainty of e factsy or propriety of the reasonings, contained in the several papers so publishedfi which must still rest on the credit or judgment of their respective authors. It is likewise necessary on this occasion to remark, that it is an estar blished rule of the Society, to which they will always adhere, nevel to giere their opinion, as a Body, upon any sultject} either of Nature or Art, tllat cotnes before them. Ahd therefore the thanks, whichare frequently proposed frotn the Chair to be giverl to the authors of SllCh papers as are read at their accustomed meetings, or to the persons through whose hands tlley receive themf alse to be considered in no other light t,han asa matter of cierility, in return for the respect shewn to the SoZ ciety by those conlmunications. The like also is to be said with reg;ardto the several proiccts, inventionss and curiosities of various. kinds, vvhich are ofi;en exhibited to the Society; the authors whereof; or those who tshibit them, fiequently talae the liberty to report, and even to certify in the public news-papbers, that they have met with the highest applause and approbation. And therefore it is hoped, that no regard will hereafter be paid to such reports, and public notices-; which in some instances llave been too lightly crediteds to the dishorlous of .,the Society.
