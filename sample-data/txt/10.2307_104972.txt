T H E R E was felt here a violent of an earthquake on the shock 18th of this month of February, three or four minutes before eight in the morning. It was not perceived in my house, nor in many others: but those persons, who were in bed, or not in motion, felt it. Two of the bells in this city struck each one stroke. A considerable number of people were affected with a kind of vertigo, without being sensible of the earthquake. It was felt throughout the whole territories of this republic. It occasioned much confusion at Amsterdam in some churches, where service was performing. Many persons quitted their houses at Maestricht; but only for a short time.
