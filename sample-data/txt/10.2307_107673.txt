[76 j IX. Croonian Lecture. On the anatomical structure of the Eye, illustrated by microscopical drawings, executed by F. BAVER, Esq. By Sir EVERARD HOME, Bart. V. P. R. S. Read November 1i5, 1821. IAV IN G found an extraordinary advantage fronm Mr. BAUER S microscopical observations, when applied to anato'. mical investigations of other organs of anirnals, I requested him to give me his assistance in the examination of the different parts of the eye iin the human species, quadrupeds, and birds. In the first place, I wished him to ascertain whether the marsupium in the bird's eye is muscular; as I had advanced such an opinio'n in the Lecture for 1795. ^ After the most careful examination, he has decided that it is not; but is a fine vascular membrane, as represented in the annexed drawing, which Dr. YOUNG had long considered it The real structure of the marsupium being thus completely established, I was led to inquire what parts, contained within the globe of the eye, are possessed of muscular fibres. Mr. BAUER, on examining the ciliary processes found that the anterior layer is made up of about 8o processes, lying directly behind the iris, and with it firmly attached at the base to the choroid and sclerotic coat: these are membranous, very vascular, and the surface next the lens concave; that next the iris, convex. They are distinctly shown in the anne ,xed drawings. Sir EVERARD HOME on the anatomical structure, &c. 77 Between these membranous processes there are bundles of muscular fibres of 21of an inch in length, which I believe have not before been described: they originate all rousnd from the capsule of the vitreous humor, pass forward over the edge of the lens, are attached firmly to its capsule and there terminate, as is seen in the drawings. They are unconnected with the ciliary processes, or iris. In the human eye, and that of the quadruped, they form bundles with intermediate spaces. In the bird, they are nearly one continued layer of muscular fibres. The choroid coat, which may be said to terminate anteriorly at the ciliary processes, is membranous in its structure; so far similar to the marsupium of the bird when unfolded; but in the choroid coat, Mr. BAUER has discovered lymphatic vessels, one on each side of every principal artery, not before ascertained, although there could be no doubt of their existence; and the arteries as will be seen in the drawings, have not the usual direction, but run parallel to one another, totally unlike those in the marsupium. In the quadrupeds with the tapetum lucidum, the nigrum pigmentum is principally deposited between the sclerotic and choroid coat. In the human eye and that of the bird, between the choroid coat and retina, a thin pellucid covering being interposed between it and the expansion of the optic nerve; the marsupium has a similar covering between the nigrunm pignientum, and the vitreous humor. The colour of the nigrum pigmentum differs in intensity according to the colour of the hair; and when the animal is quite white, appears to be altogether wanting. That the marsupial membrane secretes the nigrum pigmnentum, there can be no doubt; and for that purpose it is very abundantly supplied with large 78 Sir EVERARD HOME on the arteries. That the choroid in the human eye, as well as that of the bird does the same, is in some measure proved by the fine injection thrown into the arteries of that membrane escaping from their termination, so as to form a layer of injection behind the retina without the smallest appearance of extravasation. The membrane between the nigrum pigmentum and retina, has been described by Dr. JACOB, of Dublin, and his account of it published in the Philosophical Transactions. The niigrum pignmentum appears to be nothing more than the colouring matter of the red globules, rendered black in the act of separation from the arteries; it is also deposited :upon the surface of the ciliary processes and iris, by the arteries with which they are loaded, and covered by a pellucid membrane. In the horse, the arteries of the ciliary processes are very large; and I am led to believe that the extraordinary disease that animal is liable to in India, of having two species of worms (the strongylus armatus and filiaris papillosa) found alive in the aqueous humor, is produced by the ova or youn g worms escaping from the terminations of those arteries; more -especially as Mr. HODGSON, in his engravings of diseased arteries, has figured the strongylus armatus adhering to the inner membrane of the superior mesenteric artery of the horse, showing that in that animal it gets into the circulation. The iris is fixed at its origin to the annular ligament; is divisible into two layers; the posterior, muscular; the fibres radiating towards the-pupil, at which part there is a regular sphincter muscle; the anterior, membranous. My friend Mr. MAUNOIR, of Geneva, is, I believe, the first person who made out this structure, and gave an engraving of of \f . .A ~ ~ ~ ~ ~~~\'e6Ew4'raW Aitao..2)ww.MDCCCXXULlakVMp.71 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~lb * | le a e e ak a 77.'s -Czy abAzitj. 1 dr Phds.'.Zw&r.MDCCCXX1LPlat?

I have much pleasure in stating, that what he represented in the quadruped, corresponds with Mr. BAUER's drawings from the human eye, made before Mr. MAUNOIR'S Treatise on the artificial pupil was shown to him. The capsule of the crystalline lens is made up of two hemispheres of different texture, in which the lens is completely enclosed; the anterior portion is more dense than the other. The posterior is so thin, as to appear a continuation of the capsule of the vitreous humor, but from its curling up when cut, it must partake of the same nature as the anterior portion. The vitreous humor consists of a very delicate gelatinous substance, exit ceedingly elastic, abundantly supplied with branches of vessels. Arteries are sometimes met with carrying red blood, and in a degree capable of being injected. The fibres of the lens hlave the appearance of hairs like those formed in spun glass. The situation of the marsupiumn is shown both in the eagle and goose, and the difference of its radius of curvature at the bottom of the eye on its two sides, is as ?70to sloth of an inch.
