On the Figure, Dimensions, and Mean Specjflc Gravity of the Earth, as derived from the Ordnance Trigonometrical Survey of Great Britain and Ireland. Cormn municated by Lieut.. Colonel JAMES, R.E., F.R.S. Ec., Superintendent of the Ord-, nance Survey. Received April 30,-Read May 8, 1856. T HE Trigonometrical Survey of the United Kingdom commenced inl the year 1784, under the immediate auspices of the Roval Society; the first base was traced by General Roy, of the Royal Engineers, on the 16th of April of that year, on Hounslow Heath, in presence of Sir JOSEPH BANKS, the then President of the Society, and some of its most distinguished Fellows. Trhe principal object which the Government had then in view, was the connexion of the Observatories of Pal is and Greenwich by means of a triangulation, for the purpose of determining the difference of longitude between the two observatories. A detailed account of the operations then carried on is given in the first volume of the 'Trigononmetrical Survey,' which is a revised account of that which was first published in the ' Philosophical TrIansactions' for 1785 and three following years. At the time when these operations were in progress, the Su'vey of several counties in the south-east of England, including Kent, Sussex, Surrey, and Hampshire, was also in progress, under the direction of the Master-General of the Ordnance, for the purpose of mnaking military maps of the most. important parts of the kingdom in a military point of view; and it was then decided to make the triangulation which extended fromI Hounslow to Dover the basis of a triangulation for these surveys. It is extremely to be regretted that a more enlarged view of the subject had not then been taken, and a propel geometrical projection made for the mnap of the whole kingdom. As it is, the south-eastern counties were first drawn and published in reference to the meridian of Greenwich, then Devonshire in reference to the meridian of B3utterton in that county, and thirdlly the northern counties in reference to the meridian of Delamere in Cheshire; but there is a large intermediate space, the maps of which are made of various sizes to accommodate them to the convergence of the meridian. In 1799 the Royal Society gave further proof of the interest it toolk in the progress of the Survey, by lending to the Ordnance its great 3-foot Theodolite, made by RAMSDEN for the purpose of expediting the work of the Survey; and I have great pleasure in stating, that although this instrument has been in almost constant use for the last sixty-seven years, during which time it has been placed on the highest MDCCCLVI. 4 L 608 ON THE FIGURE, DIMENSIONS, AND MEAN SPECIFIC GRAVITY OF THE EARTH, church towers and the loftiest mountains in the kingdom, from the Shetlands to the Scilly Islands, it is at this day in perfect working older, and probably one of the very best, instruments that was ever made. Trhe great Trigonometrical operations of the Survey have been carried on under so many officers. fronm the titne of their commencement under General Roy down to the present time, that it would be quite imipossible, in this short notice, to mention more than the names of several Superintendents who have succeeded General Roy, viz. Colonel WrLLIAMS, Major-General MUDGE Major-General COLBY, and Colonel HALL; but in justice to the highly meritorious body of non-commissioned officers of the Corps of Royal Sappers and Miners, I should state, that whilst in the early part of the Survey the most important and delicate observations were entrusted solely to the commissiwied officers, these duties have of late years been performed by the noncommissioned officers with the greatest skill and accuracy. In the Historical sketch of the Survey which I purpose publishing shortly, I hope to be able to do justice to the individual merits of all employed. The computations connected with the corrections of the observed angles, to make the whole triangulation as nearly as possible perfectly consistent have been most voluminousq, and have been inade under the direction of Lieut.-Colonel YOLLANDJ Captain CAMERON, and Captain ALEXANDER R. CLARKE; but I gladly avail m-nyself of this opportunity to acknowledge the great and important assistance and advice which, both as regards the instruments and the calculations, we have at all times received fiom the Astronomer Royal. IThe triangulation by the methods which will be explained, is now made consistent in every part, so that any side of any triangle being taken as a base, the same distance will be reproduced when it is computed through any portion or the whole series of triangles; and when the five measured bases on which we rely are incorporated in this triangulation, the greatest difference between their measured and connputed lengths is not as much as 3 inches, and vet somie of the bases are upwards of 400 miles apart. Several bases of from five to seven miles long have been measured, but those upon which the chief reliance has been placed are the Lough Foyle and Salisbury Plain bases, which were mreasured with General COLBY'S comnpensation bars. The difference between the measured and computed length of the one base from the other through the triangulation is 014178 ft., or about 5 inches. This difference has been divided in proportion to the square root of the lengths of the measured bases, by which we have obtained the mean base which has been used in the triangulation; there is therefore a difference of + or -02 ft., or 2g inches between the measured and computed length of these bases from the mean base. The Hounslow Heath base was measured with RAMSDEN'S 100-ft. steel chains, and only differs 0173 ft., or about 2 inches, from its computed length from the mean base. The Belhelvie base in Aberdeenshire, also measured with the steel chains, differs orny 0-24 ft., or less than 3 inches, fr-om the computed length. FRO.M THE ORDNANCE TRIGONOMETRICALt SURVEY. 609 The difference between the measured and computed length of the Misterton Carr base, neat' IDoncaster, also measured with the steel chains, is only 0191 ft., or about 2 inches; and it will be observed that the difference between the compute(d anid measured lengths of these three bases (measured with chains) is not greater than the difference between the measutred and computed length of the Lough Foyle and Salisbury Plain bases (measured with the compensation bats), ft'om which itC may be infetred that bases measured with steel chains are deserving of the greatest confidence; and when the great simplicity, portability, anld cheapness of the chains is compared with the complex, heavy and expensive appatratus of the compensation bat s, I should anticipate that they would be more generally employed than they have been of late years, especially in the colonies, and in countries where the transport of heavy articles is effected with difficulty. The length of the base on Rhuddlan Marsh in No'th Wales, which was measured with steel chains, differs 1'596 ft. from the computed length ; but ftrom the circumstance that the extremities of the base are very badly situated with 'efetence to the surt'ounding rrligonotmettical stations, the angles being vely acute, and not well observed, we have placed little confidence in the result of the comparison of its computed and measured length. One of the first practical results arising ftomt the completion of the triangulation is, that we are now able to engrave the latitude and longitude on the marginal lines of the old sheets of the 1-inch map of England, and this is now being done. The following account of the Trigonomett'ical operations and calculations has been drawn up by Captain ALEXANDER R. CLARKE, R.E.: this account inay be considered as an abridgement of that more detailed account which is now in the press, and will be shortly published. It will be seen that the equatorial diameter of the earth, as derived frorn the Ordnance Survey, is 7926'610 miles, or about one mile greater than it is given by the Asttonomer Royal in his ' Figure of the Earth,' and that the ellipticity is'29--,, or Ias the Astronomer Royal conjectured, something " greater than ," which he gives in the same paper. The mean specific gravity of the earth, as derived from the observations at Arthur's Seat, was stated in a formner paper to be 5'14 ; the calculations have since been revised, and we now find it to be 5'316. The mean specific gravity of the earth, as detived from the only other observations on the attraction of mountain masses on which any reliance has been placed, viz. the Schehallien observations, give, as finally corrected by HUTTON, -92-, or almost 5'0.

I have recently received, through the Astronomer Royal, two copies of the new National Standar d Yard : it is obviously necessary that our geodetic measures should be given in reference to the standard; but not knowing from what scale the standard has been taken, I arim unable to say at present in what way the reduction is to be madle; that is, whether by reference to the comparison of the old standards which have been already made, or by the mechanical process of a direct comparison of the Ordnance Standard with the new National Standard. IS. JAMES, Lieut.-Colonel R.E. The Principal Triangulation of the Ordnance Survey of Great Britain and Ireland, extending froin the Scilly Isles, in latitude 490 53' to the Shetland Isles, in latitude 600 50', and embracing at its widest extent about 120 of longitude, consists of about 250 stations. The observations for the connexion of the trigonometrical stations have been made with four large theodolites, two of 3 feet, one of 2 feet, and the other of 18 inches in diameter. The first two instruments (one of which is the property of the Royal Society), and the 18-inch theodolite, were constructed by RAMSDR-N at the cornmencement of the trigonometrical operations in England in 1798: the 2-feet theodolite was constructed by Messrs. TROUGHTON and SIMMs at the commencement of the Irish Survey in 1824. The latitudes of thirty-two of the stations of the principal triangulation have been determined by observations made with RAMSDEN'S zenith sector, and since the destruction of that instrument in the great fire at the Tower of London, with AIRY'S zenith sector. All the observations made with these instruments have been published in detail*. Trle mode of observing with the theodolite may be shortly described as follows:The instrument being first placed very carefully over the precise centre of the station-, atn object having a fine vertical line of light, with a breadth of about 10", is set up in a convenient position within a mile ortwo of the station; this object, called the "referring-object," serves as a point of reference from which all angles are mneasulred. The lower limb of the instrument being clamped, the observer intersects the referring-object and then each of the principal points in succession, concluding with a second observation of the referring-object, which should be identical, within the limits of errors of observation, with the first reading of that object: the instrument is then unclamped and the bearings read again on different parts of the divided circle. The. method by which these observations are reduced to the most probable* 'Astronomical Observations made with RAMSDRN's Zenith Sector,' 1842. ' Astronomic 1 Observations made with Ainy's Zenith Sector,' 18'2. FROM, THE ORDNANCE TRIGONOMETRICAL SURVEY.' 611 results, is an approximate solution of the equations resulting fromd the method of least squares. The direction of the meridian has been determined by observations of the elongations of a, id X Urs. mnm. and 51 CepIhei; at six of the stations at which these observations have been made, the probable error of the result is under 01W40, at twelve under 50, at thirty-four under 0Il 70, and at fifty-one under 1"`00. MVeasured Base Lines. The account of the mredsuremnent with RAMSDEN'S steel chain of the base lines on Hounslow Heath in 1791, on S&dlisbury Plain in 1794, on Misterton Carr in 1801, and on Rhuddlan Marsh in 1806, will be found in the ' Account of the Trigonometrical Survey.' These base lines are all expressed in terms of RAMSDEN's brass scale at the temperature of 620 FAHRENHEIT. The chains were compared with RAMSDEN's prismatic bar (20 feet in length), which was laid off from the brass scale at the temperature of 540 FAHRENHEIT. By a series of comparisons of the Ordnance 10-foot standard iron bar (designated Q) with RAMSDENSs 20-foot standard, made at Southamnpton, it was found that RAMSDEN'8 bar-=20^0007656 feet of 01, so that any measurement expressed in tertms of feet of RAMSDEN's bar at 620 must be mnultiplied by 1 0000383 to give feet of 1, at the same temperature. Also to reduce a measurement expressed in terms of RAMSDEN'S brass scale to the samne in terms of RAMSDEN'S bar, it must be increased by a quantity corresponding to the difference of the expansions of brass and iron for 80; and taking these quantities as used in the reduction of the bases, it will be found that the multiplier is 1 0000328, and hence to reduce the old bases to feet of 1, they mnust be multiplied by 1P0000X11. In 1516 a base line of five miles in length was measured by Major-General COLBY on Belhelvie Sands, Aberdeenshire: the measurement was effected with RAMSDEN'S steel chaills, and in precisely the same manner as the previous bases. Trhe chains were compared with RAMSDEN's bar by Mr. BERGE both before and after the measure' nent. In 1826-27 the Lough Foyle Base was measured in the north of Ireland with MajorGeneral COLBY'S compensation bars. Of this mneasurement a description in detail has been published*. In 1849 the ol0 base line on Salisbury Plain was remneasured. This measurement exceeded the old measure when reduced to the same standard by a foot. The guns muatking the extremities of the old line were found imrbedded very firtnml in the earth, and in all probability in exactly their original positions. By a series of comparisons instituted in 1834t between the Royal Astronoinical* 'Account of the Measurement of the Lough Foyle Base,' by Captain YOLLAbrP, R.E., 1847. t The observations which were made by the late Lieut. MURPHY, Royal Engineers, are given in the Account of the Measuremnent of the Lough Foyle Base.' 612 ON THE FIGURE, DIMENSIONS, AND MEAN SPECIFIC GRAVITY OF THE EARTH, Society's Scale and the Ordnance Standard 02, it was determined that Ord. Standard 01= 1 19'997508 mean inches of the centre yard of the Royal Astronomical Society's Scale; also from Mr. BAILY'S comparison of this scale with the standard metre he determined * Standard Metre =39 369678 mean inches of the centre yard of the Royal Astronomical Society's Scale. From more recent observations, it appears that the Royal Astronomical Society's scale has undergone a permanent alteration of length; the interval however between the two series of observations above quoted was not sufficiently long to vitiate the connexion thus established between the Ordnance Standard and the metre. The resulting value of the metre in terms of O1 is therefore Standard Metre =3 2808746 mean feet of 01, and hence since the inetre =443-296 lines of the toise of Peru, Toise 6,3945438 mean feet of 01. Reduction of the Triangulation. If u represent the true ratio of the distance between any two points 'in a network of triangulation to the base line; A B C.. .A'... the true angles, whose observed values are A+ca. B+P, C+y...A'+'..., then if ul be the calculated value of u obtained by using the series of observed angles ABC..., u the value obtained by using the series of observed angles A'B'C'.... u =f(ABC...)=f(A'B'C'...)=.... u,=u+ac.o+bf +er +...-. ul = u + a, a+ 1113' + c'r'? and so on. Each different calculation of u will therefore give a different value for that quantity. In the necessary existence of these discrepancies among the calculated values of u, it becomes of much importance to obtain the most probable value. In ordinary calculations this has been generally effected by assuming it to be the mean of all the calculated values ulu'lu'..... This might be improved upon by assigning to each value of u its proper weight by means of the weights of the observed angles, but the method would still be imperfect and discrepancies would still exist in other parts of the work. From the above equations, though we cannot determine the precise value of lu, Vet we can obtain some precise information respecting the errors of observation; for we have evidently, since the quantities abc...a'b'c'... are numerical, certain equations of condition between the unknown errors. But the number of such equations of condition for the whole figure being necessarily less than the actual number of errors, an indefinite number of systems of corrections* Memoirs of the Royal Astronomical Society, vol. ix. FROM THE ORDNANCE TRIGONOMETRICAL SURVEY. 613 might be obtained that would satisfy all the geometrical relations of the triangulation. The question then is to determine that system which is the most probable, and the solution derived from the theory of probabilities is, that the most probable system of corrections xx'... is that which makes the function Y(wx2)* a minimuml. If n be the number of observed angles in a network of triangulation, m the number of points, then 2(m-2) will be the number of angles absolutely required to fix all the points, consequently the geometrical figure must supply n-2m+4 equations of condition amongst the true angles or amongst the corrections to the observed angles: we have therefore n-2+4 equations of the form o = a, + b1x + cax'+ d1x"?.+ O=a2+bx+clx'+dg'"+,..... which are to be determined so that the quantity U=wxV2+w'x12+W1/X"2 +. shall be a minimum.

In order that the results of the. triangulation as applied to the determination of the figure of the earth might have the greatest weight possible, the most probable system of corlections has been calculated according to BEssE~sS mlethods shortly described ubove. The principal and only objection to the application of this method of obtain ing the most trustworthy results, is the extremely voluminous and tedious nature of thle calculations. T5he total number of equations of condition for the, triangular. tion is .920; if therefore the whole were to be reduced 'in one mass, it would involve as a small part of the work the solutio-n of an equation of 920 unknown quantities.' T]he tallowing method of approxitnation therefore was adopted : the triangulation wras divided into twenty-one parts or figures, each affording a not unmanageable numnber of equations of condition; four of these parts, not adjacent, were first'adjusted l.)y tide method just explained. The corrections detertninecl in these figures were substituted, so far as they entered, in the equations of condition of the adjacen figure, and tile sun) of the squares of the remaining corrections in that figure lnade a minirnum. Thus each division of the triangulations, with the exception of the four specifiedd above, is, dependent upon one or more of the figures to which it 'is adjacent. Weewxi h egto h bevto orsodn oteerrw 614 ON TrHE FIGURE, DIMENSIONS, AND MEAN SPECIFIC GRAVITY OF THE EARTH, The average number of equations in each figure is about 44; the greatest number of equations in any one figure is 77. Each figure was worked by two independent computers. This of itself alone would have been insufficient to secure freedom from error, but the final working of every possible triangle, after the corrections were applied to the observed angles, secured perfect accuracy. Corrections to all the observed bearings having been obtained in the manner explained, it is clear that since all the geometrical relations of the figure are satisfied, no discrepancies can present themselves between the calculated values of the distance between any two points by whatever series of angles it may be obtained. The triangles are calculated by LEGENDRE'S theorem. This theorem may be applied to triaigles of any magnitude, up to two or three hundred miles, without fear of error. Tihe greatest errors that can result in the values of the sides a) b of a spheroidal triangle as calculated from the side c by spherical trigonometry, using the geometric mean of the principal radii of curvature of the surface for the mean latitude of the triangle as the radius of the sphere, are (the position of the triangle in azimuth being the variable quantity with respect to which the errors are the greatest possible), fa-~pt4(412+M2 +4n 2)4 Eb 0b(12+4m2+4n')i e2 cos9?,A. abc where R is the radius of the sphere, e the eccentricity of the earth's surface, Imn the cosines of the angles of the triangle opposite abc respectively, and x its rnean latitude. Comparison of Bases. The absolute length of any side, or' the linear scale of the triangulation, is made to depend on the bases measured with the compensation bars at Lough Foyle and on Salisbury Plain. The discrepancy between the measured and calculated length of these bases is about 5 inches; this discrepancy is divided so tha-t each of the two bases shall exhibit an error proportional to the square root of its length: the comparison of all the bases is then as follows Length in terms Length in terms Lenth in Date.

For short distances the ordinary formulae are sufficient, but in the case of distances above 80 or 100 miles the following formula are used, A being the given point, and B that whose latitude and longitude are required: Let s =distance AB measured on the surface of the earth v =normal to minor axis at A 0 =angle subtended at the foot of this normal by the curve s a =azimuth of B at A cJ-azimuth of A at B, both measured from the north = latitude of A; Z=90-4 =' latitude of B W =difference of longitude =eradius of curvature of the meridian for the latitude -1(4+4') sin I(x~-O) tan (a X) =Si'll (6 cot ) 2 tan -(a '+4+)= cot -ol 2 s s Cos2( a (Xo + 1o 2 e20n20 0=+/i( ,9 CO 2.os c -e2) Cos2 X sin 2 a, 4 being a minute angular correction here expressed, as also 0, in angular measure. In the calculation of latitudes and longitudes we must suppose all the points to be projected on a regular spheroidal surface (A), very nearlyagreeing with the actual surface covered by the triangulation, then by equations of condition between the observed and calculated latitudes, longitudes and azimuths, small alterations to the elements of the assumed spheroid and its position must be determined: this new spheroid (B) will be that most nearly representing the actual surface under consideration. For the first spheroid, that determined by the Astronomer Royal as most nearly representing the earth's surface; namely, a=20923713 feet b=20853810 feet was used as the spheroid of reference (A). If we resolve the inclination of the actual surface at any point to that of the spheroid (B) at the same point, or rather its projection, into two inclinations, one north and the other east, and call these inclinations ,n and gn, these quantities being positive when the actual surface, as compared with that of the regular surface, rises to the MDcccLvI.4M 616 ON THE FIGURE, DIMENSIONS, AND MEAN SPECIFIC GRAVITY OF THE EARTH, north and to the east, and if we put e and a for the same quantities at Greenwich, from which point the calculations of latitude and longitude and azimuths had their commencement, then each point at which the latitude has been observed will give an equation of the form i,=a+b{+ c+mIa+n&e, and each point at which the longitude or direction of the meridian has been determined will give an equation of the form 27=a' + bw ++ c' +m'ba+n' ie in which ka and be are the increments to the semiaxis major and eccentricity of the spheroid (A).

In obtaining the spheroid most nearly representing the measured arcs of meridian, we shall follow the method given by BESSEL in his determination of the figure of the earth in Nos. 333 and 438 of the ' Astronomisehe Nachrichten ;' substituting for the English arc as used by him, the data of the present results, and for the Indian arc as used by him, the data contained at page 427 of Colonel EVE REST'S 'Account of the Measurement of rrwo Sections of the Meridional Arc of India.' Colonel EVEREST'S measurements are expressed in terms of his standard 10-foot iron bar A, and the standard 6-inch scale A, twenty parts of any linear result being in terms of feet of the iron standard and one part in terms of feet of the 6-inch scale. By means of the comparisons contained at page 436 of Colonel EvEREST'S work and at pages 101 and [40] of the 'Account of the Measurement of the Lough Foyle Base,' it will be found, that to reduce the results contained in the former work to feet of 0,, they must be multiplied by *99999026. There is, however, some uncertainty in the unit of measure of the earlier portion of the second East Indian Arc.

Hence if s be the mnevidian distance of two points whose latitudes are ;1+x, and X2+x,, we must substitute in this equation P+x2-xl for p, neglecting the influence of the small quantities x on the mean latitude of the arc; after this substitution we obtain X2 AhI p1809P+ 2a sin p cos 2X-a' sin 2p cos 4X) p = +2oa cos p cos 2X.

This equation contains the relation between the corrections to the terminal latitudes of a measured line s required to bring them into accordance with the measured distance, the elements of the spheroid of reference being as expressed above in g a,1 i k. An arc in which there are n observed latitudes will therefore afford n-I equations of the form x2-x1=m+ai+bk; the quantities ik must then be determined so as to make the function IT2+X2+j3+ *.. a minimum.
