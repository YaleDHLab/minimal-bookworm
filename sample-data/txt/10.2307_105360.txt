[92] XV. A further Account of the same Case: in a Letter to the Right Honourable the Lord Cadogan, F. R. S. from the Rev. William Henry, D. D. F. R. S. My Lord, I H A V E now standing by me William Carey, the young man, of the ossification of whose limbs I had the honour formerly to acquaint your Lordship: and now, in obedience to your commands, give an account of his case since that time. Read June 14, 1759. I had him sent up in March last to Mercer's Hospital in this city. After examining his case, the physicians and surgeons concluded, that the only probable chance to prevent the progress of the ossification, and to remove the evil already effected, was putting him into a mercurial course. This they tried; and after some slighter mercurial medicines, they, in the latter end of April, laid him down in a salivation, thro' which he passed with safety. This dried up the running sores at his elbows, occasioned by the bursting of the skin, thro' the ossification. Some lighter callus, which was shooting into bones, seems to be softened: in consequence of which he can move his elbows, and the joints of his fingers, with more ease; and he has a little more clearness and vivacity in his countenance: but none of the ossified parts are reduced, nor is there any appearance of their reduction; and he still continues to wear an hectic look. To reduce the ossified parts, they [93] they have applied to them mercurial plaisters; the effect of which time will shew. As he is now discharged out of the hospital, they have directed him to bathe continually in the ocean, which happens to be very convenient to his habitation; and have directed him to anoint his limbs with the soapy juice of the quercus marina, which lies in plenty along the shore. I shall attend to the event of this process, and send your Lordship a particular account of it. I am, with all regard, Your Lordship's much obliged, and most obedient humble Servant, William Henry.
