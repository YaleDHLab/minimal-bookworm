(3059) An Observation and Experiment concerning a Mineral Balsom, found in a Mine of Italy by Signior Marc-Antonio Castagna, inserted in the 7th. Giornale Veneto de Letterati of June 22. 1671, and thence English'd as follows; IN the Territory of Bergamo, Signior M. Ant.

Encouraged hereby to prosecute this work, he made his Workmen digg into the very bowels of the Hill, and after much labour and charge discover'd holes in some stones, as if excavated by art, of a greenish colour, in which he found, as distilled by nature and kept in vessels, that liquor and balsom,which proved the source of that scent, which was limpid and of a white colour, like the white of an egg, but somewhat oleaginous, floating upon all sorts of liquors like oyl. Besides, he met in the same Cavities some small grains concreted of the said liquor, resembling that which they call white Amber; which, being Chymically distilled, had the same odour with the Balsom. This raiseth the curiosity of many, to know what rich Ore may be lodged amongst or under those stones. E e e e Two
