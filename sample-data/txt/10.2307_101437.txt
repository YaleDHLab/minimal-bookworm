Observables in the Body of the Earl of Balcarres. These following Observations, were a while since sent out of Scotland by an ingenious person, an Eye-witness, to Sir Robert Moray, 1. That the Belly of this Nobleman being opened, the Omentum or Net was found lean and small: his Liver very bigg; the Spleen bigg also, filled with a black and thick humour. His Stomach and Entralls all empty, of a Saffron-colour, distended with wind onely. The Bladder of Gall swelled with a black humour: the Kidneys filled with a kind of grumous bloud. 2. That in the Thorax or chest, the Lobes of the Lungs were all entire, but of a bad colour; on the left side somewhat black and blue, and on the right, whitish; with a yellowish knob under one of the Lobes. 3. That (87) 3. That the Pericardium or the Case of the Heart being opened, there appeared none of that water, in which the Heart uses to swim; and the external Surface of it, from the Base to the Tipp, was not smooth, but very rough. It being cut asunder, a quantity of white and inspissate liquour run out,and beneath the Base, between the right and left Ventricle, two stones were found, whereof the one was as bigg as an Almond, the other, two Inches long and one broad, having three Auricles or crisped Angles: And in the Orifice of the right Ventricle, there was a fleshy fattish Matter. 4. That the whole Body was bloudless, thin, and emaciated, of a black and bluish Colour. 5. The Scull being opened, both the Cerebrum and Cerebellum were bigg in proportion to the Body; and out of it run much more Bloud, than was seen in both the other Regions together.
