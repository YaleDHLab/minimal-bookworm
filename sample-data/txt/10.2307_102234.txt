The Anatomy of a Monstrous P I G Communicated to the R. S. By an Ingenious Student in Physick. ABout the beginning of Decem.1682. among many Pigs of a Sow,there was one wch had no passage for the Faeces either Solid or Liquid, altho the Anus was not outwardly clos'd up;which whether natural,or caused by the Neighbours who had attempted a Cure before I saw it, I cannot (189) cannot positively assert. There was likewise no vilible sign of either Sex. Being dissected it afforded these following observations. First the Guts were very much distended and transparent, and through them appeared the Faeces very liquid accompanyed with no small quantity of Wind; the end of the Rectum was entirely closed like a bladder, and sealed as it were Hermetically, pendulous in the cavity, and not in the least continued to a Sphincter, of which there was no sign. Secondly, there was no Bladder to be found, nor Uterus, or any mark of what Sex it was designed for. Thirdly,to supply the place of a Bladder,both the Ureters were inserted into the Rectum within an lnch or thereabouts of the end Fourthly,the Stomack was full, even to distension, of an hard Substance,which being opened was exactly the same to appearance with hard press'd Curds. Fifthly, the Chile came freely enough out of the Ductus Pecquelianus. where it was inserted to the Jugular,upon the smallest pressure of the Intestines. Sixthly, I could not urge the liquid or Flatulent Contents of the Guts upwards within two Inches of the Pilorus, tho I pressed them till they brake, which hindred the inquiry after a Valve that possibly might be there to hinder the regress of any thing to the Stomack.
