]PHILOSOPHICAL OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF LONDON. FOR THE YEAR MDCCCJV PART I. LONDON, PRINTED BY WV. BULMER AND CO. CLEVELAND-ROW, ST. JAMES S; AND SOLD BY G. AND WV. NICOL, PALL-MALL, BOOKSELLERS TO HIS MAJESTY, AND PRINTERS TO THE ROYAl. SOCIETY. MDCCCI V. 'ADVERTISEMENT. THE Committee appointed by the ]?Ryal Society to direct the publication of the Philosofphical Transactions, take this opportunity to acquaint the Public, that it fully appears, as well from the councilbooks and journals of the Society, as fiom repeated declarations which have been made in several former T-ransaclions, that the printing of them was always, fromt time to time, the single act of the respective Secretaries, till the Forty-seventh Volume: the Society, as a Body, never interesting themselves any further in their publication, than by occasionally recommending the revival of them to soni of their Secretaries, when, from the particular circumstances of their affairs, the 7Yansactions had happened for any length of time to be intermitted. And this seems principally to have been done with a view to satisfy the Public, that their usual meetings were then continued, for the improvement of knowledge,, -and benefit of mankind, the great ends of their first institution by the Royal Charters, and which they have ever since steadily pursued. But the Society being of late years greatly enlarged, and their communications more numerous, it was thought advisable, that a Comrnitte6 of their members should be appointed, to reconsider the papers read before them, and select out of themi such as they should judge most proper for publicationin the future ?fransaclions; which was accordingly done upon the 26th of M arch, 1752. And the grounds A 2 L 1Y I of their choice are, and will continue to be, the importance and sins gularity of the subjects, or the advantageous manner of treating them; without pretending to answer for the certainty of the facts, or pro. priety of the reasonings, contained in the several papers so published, which must still rest on the credit or judgment of their respective authors. It is likewise necessary on this occasion to remark, that it is an established rule of the Society, to which they will always adhere, never to give their opinion, as a Body, upon any subject, either of Nature or Art, that comes before thern. And therefore the thanks which are frequently proposed from the Chair, to be given to the authors of such papers as are read at their accustomed meetings, or to the persons through whose hands they receive them, are to be considered in no other light than as a matter of civility, in return for the respect shewn to the Society by those communications. The like also is to be said with regard to the several projects, inventions, and curiosities of various kinds, which are often exhibited to the Society; the authors whereof, or those who exhibit them, frequently take the liberty to report, and even to certify in the public news-papers, that they have met with the highest applause and approbation. And therefore it is hoped, that no regard will hereafter be paid to such reports and public notices; which in some instances have been too lightly credited, to the dishonour of the Society.
