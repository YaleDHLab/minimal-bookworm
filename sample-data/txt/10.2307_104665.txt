XXI. An extraordinary Case of a Fracture of the Arm; communicated by Mr. John Freke, F. R. S. Surgeon to St. Bartholomew's Hospital. T H E following Extract of a Letter from Mr. John Barde, Surgeon, in New York, having been communicated to me, I thought the Case so curious, and to have been treated in so skilful and regular a manner, as to be worthy of being laid before this learned Society. J. F R E K E. E e e `` I N Read April 5. 1750. [398] `` I N May 1746. as Colonel Morris's Lady was `` going from this City to Morrisena, the Co`` lonel's Country Seat, she had the Misfortune of `` being thrown out of her Chaise by the Horses `` suddenly falling down; by which means she had `` both the Bones of her left Arm broke. She was `` immediatly conveyed to the Hermitage, a Coun`` try Seat belonging to the Honourable Joseph Mur`` ray, Esq; which is about a Mile and a Half from `` the Place where she met with this unlucky Acci`` dent. Being sent for by the Colonel, I examined `` the Case, and found the Bones broke in an ob`` lique Direction, a very great Contusion of the `` Muscles, and the Arm already tumified; which, `` together with the being three Months gone with `` Child, obliged me, previous to the Reduction, `` to bleed her in the Right Arm. I then care`` fully reduced the broken Arm, and applied the `` proper Bandages. `` The Case succeeded, with less Inflammation than `` usually attends more simple Accidents of this Kind; `` and, in about twelve Days, she ventured to go `` from the Hermitage to Morrisena, being about `` six Miles. But what I think remarkable in this `` Case is, that tho' the Ends of the fractured Bones `` had been exactly applied to each other, and tho' `` the Bandages had been continued forty Days, yet, `` upon their being removed, the Callus remained `` so soft and flexible, that her Arm could be bent `` with the greatest Ease into any Position, and appear`` ed perfectly strait, to the Satisfaction of the Patient `` and Family. But, as I observed the Callus to be `` uncon[399] `` unconfirmed, I re-applied the Bandage, which re`` mained on five Weeks longer. `` Upon a second Examination, I found, to my `` Surprize, and the great Uneasiness of the Patient `` and Family, the Callus as soft and yielding as `` before. I therefore could not help thinking this `` Case to be similar to two Cases which Hildanus `` gives the History of from his own Practice: For, `` as the Patient at this time was about five Months `` gone with Child, Nature determined those nutri`` tious and agglutinating Juices, which were neces`` sary to form and consolidate the Callus, into a `` different Chanel; viz. to the Support and In`` crease of the Faetus. As a Consequence of this `` Opinion, I contrived a Bandage made of Velvet, `` with four thin Blades of Steel, a Quarter of an Inch `` broad, and seven Inches long, which were covered `` with Velvet, and fixed to the Inside of the Velvet `` Bandage; and to the Bandage itself I fixed four `` small Buckles, with their corresponding Straps. `` The Bandage thus contrived, and buckled on the `` Arm, resembled a Muffitie, and was wore with the `` greatest Conveniency, keeping the Arm in a strait `` Direction, for four Months longer. In the mean `` time, the Patient was made easy by the encourage`` ing Hopes I gave her, that, after her Labour, the `` Oeconomy of Nature would be more immediately `` directed to the Recovery of the Use of her Arm. `` And, indeed, so it turned out: For the Callus `` remained unconfirmed, her Arm useless, and at `` particular times painful, till within nine Days of `` her Delivery; when, all on a sudden, she ac`` quainted the Colonel, that her Arm was quite E e e 2 `` free [460] `` free from Pain, and had a very different Feeling `` from what it had before. From that time, in less `` than a Month, the Callus was intirely confirmed, `` and the Patient recovered the Use of her Arm; `` which, considering the oblique Direction of the `` Fracture, and the long-continued Softness of the `` Callus, has its natural Beauty and Straitness `` wonderfully preserved. `` I know that a Woman's Pregnancy is mentioned `` in general, by several Authors, as an Hindrance of `` the Callus being so soon confirmed as in other `` Circumstances. But, except the two Cases men`` tioned by Turner, and taken from Hildanus, I `` do not remember to have read any History, where `` the usual Oeconomy of Nature, in restoring a `` fractured Bone, was so intirely, and for so long a `` Time, interrupted; and where the Cause of such `` an Interruption appears so plain, as in the Case I `` have been here relating,'' &c.
