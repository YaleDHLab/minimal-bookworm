[409] XXIII. The Latitude and Longitude of York determined from a Variety of Astronomical Observations; together with a Recommendation of the Method of determining the Longitude of Places by Observations of the Moon's Transit over the Meridian. Contained in a Letter from Edward Pigott, Esq. to Nevil Maskelyne, D. D. F. R. S. and Astronomer Royal. Read June 29, 1786. S I R, Bootham, York, March 16, 1786. THE great number and variety of observations I have made for determining the longitude and latitude of York will, I believe, settle those points very accurately: I therefore wish to have them presented to the Royal Society, and beg the favour of you to be at that trouble. The instruments I used were a good gridiron pendulum clock, a 21/2 feet reflector, an eighteen-inch quadrant by BIRD, and a transit instrument made by S~SSON. The difference of meridians between Greenwich and York was found by the following methods. Occultations 410 Mr. PIGOTT'S Determination of Occultations of stars by the moon. App. time. 1783 h.

Mr. GOODRICKE's emersion of Sept. 17, 1783, is used instead of mine, it being undoubtedly more exact. To enter into any detail concerning the eclipses of Jupiter's satellites would be useless, as it is a matter so amply considered by every astronomer. I shall only say that the exactness expected even from those of the first satellite is, in my opinion, too highly rated. Among the various objections, there is one I have often experienced, and which proceeds solely from the disposition of the eye, that of seeing more distinctly at one time than at another. It may not be improper also to mention, that the observation I should have relied on as the best, that of August 30, 1785, marked excellent, and air remarkably clear both at Greenwich and York, is one of those which differ the most from the truth. This I remark without having the most distant inclination of drawing any conclusion; a single instance can be of no weight.

MECHAIN'S Observatory was 9~ 23~, and M. MESSIER'S 9~ 18~ east of Greenwich. Thus 416 Mr. PIGOTT'S Determination of Thus I have given a comparative view of the different methods I employed in settling the longitude of our Observatory, which is in Bootham, about 400 or 500 yards N. W. of the Minster. The occultations and meridian transits of the moon's limb, which make it 4~ 25~1/2, or 1~ 6~ 2~, would have been quite sufficient; but still it is interesting and useful to know how far the others err. With respect to the eclipses of the moon's spots, I think that method is in general too much neglected; and that it might be relied on infinitely more, if certain circumstances were mutually attended to. 1st, To be particular in specifying the clearness of the sky; for in hazy weather the results are very erroneous. 2dly, To chuse such spots that are well defined, and leave no hesitation as to the part eclipsed. 3dly, That every observer should, as much as possible, use telescopes equally powerful; at least let the magnifying powers be the same. A principal objection may still be urged, viz. the difficulty of distinguishing the true shadow from the penumbra. Was this obviated, I believe, the results would be more exact than from Jupiter's first satellite: undoubtedly the shadow appears better defined if magnified little; but I am much inclined to think, that with high magnifying powers there is greater certainty of chusing the same part of the shadow, which perhaps is more than a sufficient compensation for the loss of distinctness. Concerning the meridian observations of the moon's limb. The advantages and precision of this method for determining the difference of meridians is, as I have already said, so little suspected, the Latitude and Longitude of York. 417 suspected, that I flatter myself, the particulars I am going to mention will not be thought superfluous. The rule I adopted is this: The increase of the moon's R.A. in 12 hours (or any given time) found by computation, is to 12 hours as the increase of the moon's R.A. between two places, found by observation, is to the difference of meridians.

The increase of the moon's R.A. for 12 hours by computation is 23340 seconds, and 12 hours reduced into seconds is 43200; therefore, according to the rule stated above, '' '' '' '' 23340: 43200:: 141: difference of meridians=261 These easy observations and short reduction are the whole of the business. Instead of computing the moon's R.A. for 12 hours, I have constantly taken it from the Nautical Almanacs, which give it sufficiently exact, provided some attention be paid to the increase or decrease of the moon's motion. 7 Were 418 Mr. PIGOTT'S Determination of Were the following circumstances attended to, the results would undoubtedly be much more exact. 1st, Compare the observations to the same made in several other places. 2dly, Let several and the same stars be observed at these places. 3dly, Such stars as are nearest in R.A. and declination to the moon are infinitely preferable. 4thly, Your advice to get as near as possible an equal number of observations of each limb, to take a mean of each set, and then a mean of both means, cannot be too strongly urged. I am perfectly of your opinion, that it will considerably correct the error of telescopes and sight. 5thly, The adjustment of the telescopes to the eye of the observer before the observation, which you also recommend, will appear very judicious to every astronomer, who must have frequently perceived what you mention, that the sight is subject to vary. 6thly, As a principal error proceeds from the observation of the moon's limb, I think it may be considerably lessened, if certain little round spots near each limb were also observed in settled Observatories; in which case the libration of the moon will perhaps be a consideration. 7thly, When the difference of meridians, or of the latitudes of the places, is very considerable, the change of the moon's diameter becomes an equation. Though such are the requisites to use this method with advantage, only one or two of them have been employed in the observations that I have reduced. Two thirds of these observations had not even the same stars observed at Greenwich and York; and yet none of the results, except a doubtful one, differ the Latitude and Longitude of York. 419 differ 15~ from the mean; therefore, I think, we may expect a still greater exactness, perhaps within 10~, if the above particulars be attended to. When the same stars are not observed, it is necessary for the observers at both places to compute their R.A. from tables, in order to get the apparent R.A. of the moon's limb; though this is not so satisfactory as by actual observation, still the difference will be trifling, provided the stars R.A.'s are accurately settled. Your catalogue undoubtedly may be depended on the most, and those stars preferred which have their proper motions ascertained. A few years ago, I had the pleasure of communicating to you the proper motion of ~ Virginis, which I found to be 1~,02 per year, increasing in R.A. *: was this unknown, and that star observed alone with the moon, it would occasion, at this time, a very considerable error. I am also of opinion, that the same method can be put in practice by travellers with little trouble, and a transit instrument constructed so as to fix up with facility in any place. Though I have not considered this sufficiently, I shall, nevertheless, subjoin a few remarks that may engage others to turn their thoughts more fully to the subject. It is not necessary, perhaps, that the instrument should be perfectly in the meridian to a few seconds of time, provided stars, nearly in the same parallel of declination with the moon, are observed: nay, I am inclined to think, that if the instrument deviates even a quarter or half of a degree, or more, sufficient exactness can be obtained, as a table might be com* Some time previous to this communication, I had found, by the comparison of my transit observations of ~ Aquilae and ~ Virginis, that the latter had moved forward with a proper motion of 0~,91 of time, or of 13~,65 of R.A. from 1767 to 1783, in 16 years, or at the rate of 0~,853 a year, on suppositions that the proper motion of ~ Aquilae is 0~,57 a year forward. VOL. LXXVI. I i i puted, 420 Mr. PIGOTT'S Determination of puted, shewing the moon's parallax and motion for such deviation, which deviation may easily be found by the well known method of observing stars whose difference of declination is considerable. As travellers very seldom meet with situations to observe stars near the pole, or find a proper object for determining the error of the line of collimation, I shall recommend the following idea, which, I believe, has never yet been noticed, and hope it will answer the purpose. Having computed the apparent R.A. of four, six, or more stars, which have nearly the same parallel of declination, observe half of them with the instrument inverted, and the other half when in its right position; if the difference of R.A.'s between each set by observation agree with the computation, there is no error; but if they disagree, half that disagreement is the error of the line of collimation. The same observations may also serve to determine whether the distance of the corresponding wires are equal. In case of necessity, each limb of the sun might be observed in the same manner, though probably with less precision. By a single trial I made above two years ago, the result was much more exact than I expected. MAYER'S Catalogue of Stars will prove of great use to those that adopt the above method. In such a number of observations, it is not surprising that a few should be erroneous; I have rejected only three. A meridian transit of the moon's limb, August 18, 1782; ~ Sagitarii was the only star observed at York; it ' '' gives for difference of meridians,... 3 55 Perhaps the star has a proper motion, or a mistake of one second might have been made in marking the clock. An immersion of Jupiter's first satellite, June 22, 1783, which make the difference of meridians,. 3 42 ~ The the Latitude and Longitude of York. 421 The air was hazy both at Greenwich and at York. Lastly, an occultation of a star of the ninth magnitude, immerged behind the dark limb of the moon, during the eclipse of Sept 10, 1783, at 11 h. 29~ 6~ apparent time. M. MESSIER also observed it at 11 h. 50~ 49~1/4 apparent time at Paris: he determined its R.A. 349~ 22~ 17~, and declination 5~ 38~ 23~ south. M. GOODRICKE, who computes very accurately, finds it gives for difference of meridians,... 4 443/4 I am rather surprised, that the immersions of known stars of the sixth and seventh magnitude behind the dark limb of the moon are not constantly observed in fixed Observatories, as they would frequently be of great use. Latitude of York. The following determinations for the latitude of York were made with a BIRD'S 18-inch quadrant, the telescope of two feet focus, with which instrument observations of the same star seldom differ 10~.

I i i 2 The 422 Mr. PIGOTT'S Determination of The line of collimation was deduced from ~, ~, and ~ Draconis; half of each set observed with the face of the quadrant to the east, and half with its face to the west. This, as well as the other methods, is very tedious, particularly when required to be often repeated, as is the case in travelling; I shall therefore propose the following invention, the idea of which was improved on by Mr. SMEATON, and flatter myself it will prove of the greatest facility. The error of the line of collimation includes the fixed errors of the instrument, and those that are subject to change, occasioned by the wires and glasses, &c. of the telescope moving. The error of these last may be found by making the telescope turn on its center, so that the sun, stars, or terrestrial objects may be observed on the horizontal wire in two manners; first, when the wire is in its natural position, and then inverted, which is performed by turning the telescope 180 degrees, or half round: thus, this part of the error can always be known with the greatest ease; and in order to find the fixed errors, it is requisite for a single time to get the whole error of the line of collimation by one of the common methods, from which the error of the telescope being deducted, the fixed errors become known; and as they are unchangeable, if any alteration should take place, it proceeds from the telescope, and may easily be detected as shewn above. Perhaps, instead of the whole telescope, it would be sufficient only to make that part turn containing the eye-glass and wires. As the Latitude and Longitude of York. 423 As the following observations made also at York may be of use, I beg, Sir, you will annex them to my paper on the longitude and latitude of that city, which lately I had the pleasure of sending you.

Sir H. ENGLEFIELD, when at Scarborough, in August and September, 1781, was so kind as to observe, at noon, the height of his barometer and thermometer. I also made similar observations the Latitude and Longitude of York. 425 observations in the Observatory at York; from which, by eight comparisons, none disagreeing above 0,018 of an inch from the mean, I find, that the quicksilver at the sea stood 0,063 of an inch higher than at York. The barometers were made by RAMSDEN, and they agreed together to 0,005 part of an inch. We may later also expect to get the mean height of the barometer and thermometer, as there are several gentlemen that observe them every day, particularly Mr. WYVIL and Dr. WHITE at York, and Mr. CHOMONLEY at Bransby. I remain, Sir, with great regard, &c. EDW. PIGOTT. May 26, 1786.
