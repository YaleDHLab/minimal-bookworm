265 ] Note of Mr. IVORY relating to the correcting of an error in a Paper printed in the Philosophical Transactionsfor 1838, pp. 57, &c. IN the paper referred to* it is said, " Let V stand for the integral in the equation (7.), and supposing that p and X2 vary so as always to satisfy that equation, we shall have d V dp + ddV =?-" ~dp+ d 0 Now the error alluded to consists in having given a wrong sign to the differential d-V T d U the value of which, as has been said, is modified, in the question under consideration, by the equation (7.). This mistake vitiates the concluding part of the paper in pp. 63, 64, 65, as far as relates to the limits of the quantities p and 72. M. Lious-, VILLE has done the author of the paper the honour of noticing and correcting the mistake in his Journal de Mathe'matiques for April 1839. When the sign of the differential is rightly ascertained, the analysis pursued in the paper leads to a simple determination of the limits sought, as this Note will prove, the propriety of printing which in the Philosophical Transactions is submitted to the Council. For the sake of abridging expressions, put A2(1 +pX2)2+72X2, P2 ( p)2+7r2; then ( 1 _-X2) (1 .I p2 X2) = A22 _ P2 X2. By substituting this value in equation (7.), V~f _ J1 d , p2f1I 4d x d V 'Ifxx d xv+P P~I a 6dx d~r _ 3.: 4 + 3 P2 At and hence P2 dV _ fx2 dX P'x12\2 V + * d = Ad1 \); which proves that the same values of p and r2 that make V 0, will necessarily dV make T positive. Further, we have d j -,/ (1 -x )d { (3 + 2p2 p2) (I + pX2) + 2p22}; from which it follows that, whatever positive number e2 stands for, is negative for* Philosophical Transactions, 1838, p. 63.2 Ai 2 266 MR. IVORY'S NOTE FOR CORRECTING AN ERROR. all values of p that make 3 + 2 pp2 positive, that is, for all values of p less than 3. The function V is positive when p = 1 ; it is zero when p = 12 and r2 = 0. And, if we suppose that p decreases from 12 to 1 while .2 increases from 0 to c), the differential equation (A.) will in no instance be verified; because, according to what has been shown, both the terms of the equation will be positive between the limits mentioned. Thus there is no value of p less than 12 that will verify the equation (7.). It is proved in the paper (p. 62) that for every assumed value of 72, there is a positive value of p, that will verify the equation (7.); and, as it has now been shown that the values of p which verify that equation cannot be less than 12, they must be all greater than 12. Further, in the differential equation (A.), . cannot be zero; because, 2 increasing without limit, -. d X is essentially positive. Now, for all values of p between /2 ardT dV and 3, dp is negative; wherefore the same function will continue to be negative in dV the equation (A.) for all values of p and r2: and as dP dp is also negative, dp must be positive, so that p will increase above 12 without limit. If the sign of dV be changed, the result will be positive; and hence, observing that x is contained between 0 and 1, we obtain a condition between any two values of p and r2 that satisfy the equation (7.), namely, the expression (3 + pp2) ( +p) + 2pr2 must be a positive quantity, or, which is the same thing, 2 >(p2p+ 3) +j) J.
