[461] Received in October; 1767. XLV. Of the Increase and Mortality of the Inhabitants of the Island of Madeira. By Dr. Thomas Heberden, F. R. S. W H E N I consider the number of people in the Madeira, and the state of the inhabitants, I know no place more proper for forming an estimate of the increase and mortality of mankind, than this island; for the number of persons is upwards of 60,000, all of whom may be supposed to live and die in the same place where they received their existence; the accession of strangers and the egression of the natives being so equally inconsiderable, that if the one doth not exactly counterbalance the other, the difference may justly be neglected, as of no consequence in the general calculation. Read Nov. 26, 1767. This has excited my curiosity; and, by my interest with the vicar-general of this diocese, I have procured a survey from house to house in each of the respective parishes; from which, and the parish registers, I have deduced the adjoined account. An Hypothesis. The number of persons in this island, in the year 1743, was 48234 of seven years old and upwards. 2 Now [462] Now supposing the minors were in the same proportion then, as in this present year, the total of the inhabitants was 53,057. Therefore, by the rule of anatocism, they have increased at the rate of 1.0082 per cent. per annum; and by the same rule do double in 84 years 4 months and 25 days. From an exact survey, made in the beginning of the year 1767, the number of inhabitants on the island of Madeira, was as follows; Persons of seven years old and upward 58669 Persons under seven years of age 5945 Total 64614 Christened Buried Anno Males Fem.

N. B. This calculation of the mortality of the seasons is not deduced from the whole number of Inhabitants on the island, as I could not procure authentic materials to proceed with exactness; the number of the persons, from which it is calculated, is 6880.
