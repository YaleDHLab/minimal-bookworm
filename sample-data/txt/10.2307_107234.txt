= 114 ] VI. An Investigation of the general Term of an important Series in the inverse Method of finite Dfferences. By the Rev. Johns Brinkley, D. D. F. R. S. and Andrews Professor of Astronomy in the University of Dublin. Communicated by the Astronomer Rooyal. Read February 2G, 1807. TlIE theorems relative to finite diffIrences, given by M. LAGRANGE in the Berlin Memoirs for i772, have much engaged the attention of mathematicians-. M. LAPLACE has been particularly successful in his investigations respecting them; yet an important difficulty remained, to en-deavour to surmount which is the principal object of this Paper. The theorems alluded to may be thus stated. Let u represent any function of x. Let x + h, X + 2h, -x+31, &c. be successive values of x, and it, U) U &c. cor3 responding 'successive values of U. Let AP2u represent the first term of the nth order of differences of the quantities u, u, 8 &c. And let also Slu represent the first term of a series of quantities, of which the first term of the nth order of differences is u. Then (e representing the series i + 1 + -l + } &C.) -b -b I Ainu= (ex l 2. Sfu=(eX -i) provided that i3 in the expansion of (e~ i )n A &c. be substituted for Dr. BRINKLEYS Investigation of tMe general Termn, &c. i i ( Z ) , (--)3 &c.; and provided that in the expansion of ( i)_ ', fl.'1u, flflI.fi , &c. he substituted for(4) 23 f xu 3 + &c. and 4, ., &c. be substituted for (.$f, (4.)3, &C. These theorems, which M. LAGRANGE hadnot demonstrated except by induction, -have since been accurately investigated in different ways by M. LAPLACE,* and also by M. ARBOGASTt. The expanded formula for St u, or, more accurately speaking, the natural series for St u is of the form ". + fl nU~aI w It 7l tgX + Vit +V X Ai xp ?&c. The coefficients c, iy, &c. are readily obtained -by equal* tions of relation, which were first given by LAGRANGE. But to complete the solution it is obviously necessary to --obtain the law of progression and be able to ascertain any coef-. ficient independent of the preceding ones. This has not hitherto been done, as far as I know, except in lthe case of =i. M. LAPLACE has given a very ingenious investigation for that case."' This has been copied with just encomiums by M. LACROIX,? who does not mention that any one had accomplished it for any other value of n. In this Paper the general term is given for any value of At, the law of which is remarkably simple. A particular formula, remarkably simple as to its law, is also given for the case of n= 1, from which that of' LAPLACE may be deduced.Mim. Acad. Scien.

For which purpose it was first given by EULER in the VIth Vol. CoM. Petropol. and afterwards demonstrated in the VilIth Vol. of the same work. It has been differently investigated since by several authors** But LAPLACE appears to have been the first who gave a general term for the coefficients. EULER seems to have sought it in vain, for he says "I Ipsa series tcoefficientum a, Ai ,? &c. ita est comparata utvix credam, "pro ea terminum generalem posse exhiberi." As preparatory to the main object of this enquiry it has been thought proper to give investigations of the above two theorems, which will probably be found as simple as any that have appeared. It has also been found necessary, for avoiding very complex formula, to adopt a peculiar. notation,, which requires some explanation.Notation. The first term of the nth order of differences of the series O, l, 2m, &c. is denoted by _ _ An 0"' n is denotedby X A" '~" is denoted by ato 1.Z.3..n.1.2z3..m which omission of the denominators cannot produce any inconvenience, because the indices sufficiently point them out Whether those indices refer to powers, fluxions, or differences.* MACL AURIN'S Fluxions,Vol. IL p. 672., &c.

It is a very simple example of a method of very ext&nsive application with respect to analytical functions. ThNe theorems for finding fiuxions per sal-lm Communicated by me to the Royal Irish Academy, in November, i798, and published of a Series in the inverse Method ofjlnite Dffferences. 121 Let the equation (2) be multiplied by an, and the nth fluent taken, and we have Su = if +X u+ ' +..4fl. u+vu+ 2 X2b i p .12 &C. x x Also from the above value of z, it is easy to see that the exg h ')-n h n pansion of e X I i vh x e in the seventh volume of their Transactions, furnish a general method of reducing any function of -x to a series ascending by the powers of x, and that either by assigning at once the coefficient of *n or by equations of relation between the coefficients. By the converse of that method we are enabled, either from the general coefficient, or from the equations of relation, to arrive at the primitive function. The converse, therefore, applies to the summation of series, to the investigation of the general term of a recurring series, and to several other important purposes. It is evident, that it applies to finding the general term of a recurring series, because from the given scale of relation, the, primitive function can be deduced, and from the primitive function, the general coefficient may be determined. The same method extends to the reduction of any function of x, y, z, &c. and therefore the converse to finding the general term of double, triple, &c. recurring series. I had not considered the converse of the method of reduction of analytical functions afforded lby my theorems for finding fluxions per saltum, till I had seen M.A R B OG A S T 'S ingenious work, entitled " Du Calcul des Derivations." As those theorems furnish every thing that is given in the former part of his treatise, and likewise admit of more extensive application; so also the converse of them serve for deducing, with greater facility, every thing respecting recurring series, &c. contained in the same Treatise. The important uses to be derived from finding fluxions per saltum in the reduction of analytical functions, and from the converse, induced me to draw, up a particular work on that subject. Its publication has hitherto been delayed by my unwillingness to offer a fiuxional notation-different from either that of NEWTON orLEI BN I TZ, each of which is very inconvenient as far as regards the application of the theorems for finding fluxions per saltun.

(w' numbers), denote values of p, q, r, &c. satisfying the equation pjq+r+ &c. (k terms) =n, we shall see, that the number of the terms, inl which these values p' p', . . q', q,. .. r', r' &c. are found, is the number of combi.nation of m things, taking k together into the number of permutations of k things, of which t', v', &c. are the same. This is evident, because in any product oar, (k factors), the indices p', p',. . q, q', &c. are to be annexed in every possible order. And when the quantities a, A, y, &c. are each units, each of the quantities is expressed by the same quantity, iW'. f'. . l' . 12'..

The case of the above theorem, when n-1, has, on account of its importance, been a particular object of investigation among mathematicians. Although the formula in the first corollary is, as to its formation and law of progression, very simple, yet one more simple may be readily obtained by the joint application of a transformation given by M. LAPLACE in his mt thod, and of the first lemma above given; which formula and its investigation are here subjoined. This and the above general formule (n being any number), as well as the formula of LAPLACE (n being 1 ), do not enable us to compute the successive coefficients so readily as from the equations of relation. But this circumstance, it is imagined will not render what has been here done less worthy of the notice of mathematicians. Their researches for a general term in the case of of a 'Series zn the inverse Method ofjinite Diferences. i n= i, sufficiently shew of what importance the enquiry has been considered. 3 m Theorem.
