(1006) A New Invention of a Clock ascendent on a Plain inclin'd: By Mr. De Gennes, an Officer belonging to the Sea. Extracted out of the Journal Des Scavans. WE have formerly seen Clocks, that never go, but when they are applied upon a Plain inclin'd. But we never yet saw any Clocks that wind up again of themselves upon the same Plain. There is to be seen in Mr. Cospi's Study, a Wooden Wheel, which works the same effect upon a Plain Inclin'd, invented by Mr. Bondoni, a Florentine Secretary to the said Marquis. But in regard M. Legati doth not unfold this secret; and for that M. de Gennes having found out the same, hath succesfully apply'd it to a Clock;the mannr hereof, which he communicated unto me, I shall here impart. Fig.5.represents the inside of the Machin placed upon a Plain Inclin'd. The whole Invention consists in a Weight, which causes the Machine to play after the following manner. The Circle F G H being placed upon a Plain Inclin'd, A B is divided into two unequal parts by the Line G I. To restore to the least Secture its equilibrium there is fastned to the extremity of the Radius D F, a Weight F. which is sufficiently heavy to recover what the lesser Secture loses by its situation, That a Wheel or Clock may thus stand not only in equilibrium, but also ascend upward, there is placed in the middle of the Clock a Drum, which encloses the spring of the Pendulum, upon which Drum is fasten'd the Radius D F. For thus the spring being mounted, enforces the Drum to turn, and so to raise the Weight, which it cannot raise, without its becoming more heavy, in regard that coming to the point E. it is farther from the Centre, than when it was in F. and thus all the Wheel turns on that side as the spring gives way. Fig. 5. G E D H B F A C I M. de Gennes doth not here give direction how the Wheels that compose the Clock are to be made, because there (1007) that no Clock-maker that doth not understand how to apply the force of a spring to the motion of a Clock.
