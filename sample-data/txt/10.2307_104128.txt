[1] I. Extract of a Letter from Mr. Christopher Mason, concerning a Fire-ball seen in the Air, and a great Explosion heard, Dec. 11. 1741. O N the 11th Instant, at Bucksteep in Warbleton Parish, in the County of Sussex, about a Quarter before One o'Clock in the Afternoon, I observed a very dark uncommon Appearance in the North, and at the same time the Sun shone bright at my Back; when, on a sudden, there was an Explosion, as violent as the Report of a Mortar-piece, attended with a rumbling Echo, which run Eastward; and as near as I could conjecture, it came from about 40 Degrees of Elevation. Several People saw a Ball of Fire, which ran nearly Eastward, leaving a Train of Light, which continued some time. The Ball of Fire was seen, and the Report heard very loud, at Sompting, beyond Shoreham. Although I had been gazing upon the black Cloud for some Minutes, yet I saw no Fire nor Lightning. I am, &c. Read at a Meeting of the Royal Society, on January 7. 1741-2. Dec. 28. 1741. Chr. Mason. A II. A
