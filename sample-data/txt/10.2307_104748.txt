Part of a Letter from M. de Reaumur F. R. S. to the President, concerning an Earthquake felt in France, October 11. 1749. Paris, April 23. 1750. ON Saturday, the 11th of October 1749. about 7 in the Evening, there was an Earthquake in France, which, according to my own Inquiries, reached one Way above 60 Leagues in Extent, from our Coast of Poictou beyond Lucon, as far as the Neighbourhood of Blois. T t t t 2 I was Read May 17. 1750. [692] I was then at my own House at Reaumur, and sitting in a Closet on the Ground-Floor, where I had only notice of it by a Noise like to the Rattling of a Coach over a rough uneven Pavement, which seem'd to grow stronger, as at different Fits, for about a Minute and a half. I went out of my Closet to inquire what others might have felt, as I had not been at all shocked myself, in other Parts of the House; and I met with some Ladies just come in a Fright from the Apartments up one Pair of Stairs; and a learned Father of the Oratoire that was with me, and was just then run down, upon its shaking, from a Turret, on the Top of the House, the Motion of which had very much surprised him. In the Village several People also felt the Shake; but others, that happened to be employed, were not sensible of it. I was informed, that, in some other Villages and Country-Towns, it was more considerable than where I was; but I did not hear that it did any-where any Mischief worth speaking of. XLII.
