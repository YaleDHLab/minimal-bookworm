(222) IV. The Extract of a Letter from Mr. Mark Lewis, confirming the same Operation on other Persons. S H E put the Case beyond all dispute; (1.) By shewing me the Head of the Worm in the Orifice before the extracted it. (2.) He was still sensible of their approach before she could see them. (3.) She designed, what he intended to have done, that an Incision shall when he comes to Town, be made in the place, that if Worms be not then found, she may then be well spoken of. To me she gave a Catalogue of several Cures she had done in the Town and Country, one was my own Relation, I know to be a truth. Thus far we went over-night, she took Fifteen or Sixteen Worms out next Morning. I found Mr. Newton desirous to see the Operation, he was a Stranger to us both; but we complyed with his desire, were extream glad of his Company when he told us it was on your Account. He took the same Care I had done, saw the same Effects I had done over-night, only now there were not above Ten Worms; they came by two at a time, once as I remember three. I designed to have sent you some to compare with yours; told her of the Fraud my Friend, Mr. Popple, had detected in the Stamford Woman. I had provided some soft Cotton in a small Box, but why, I know not, they now all dyed the same day before I was got home, when as formerly I had kept them Fourteen or Fifteen days; they had fasted three days before I had them. I (223) I had the Curiosity to try whether I could find any Blood in them, but did not; which makes me think they feed of the same Humour they are bred of. V.
