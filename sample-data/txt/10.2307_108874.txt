IN the Philosophical Transactions for 1858, I have given an account of the Joints of the Old Red Sandstone of the co. Waterford, and demonstrated in it the existence of the following Systems of Joints (page 348): First Conjugate System. A . . 81 observations 70 46' N. of E. (Mag.) . . 32? 26' N. of E. (True.)

Since the publication of the foregoing account, I have found the system (A, C) in Donegal, Mourne, Cornwall and elsewhere, and have reason to believe it to be the most important of all the joint-systems of AWaterford. I shall therefore call it the Primary System of Conjugate Joints, and the systems (A', C'); and (A", C") I shall call 3 G2 394 REV. S. HAUGHTON ON THE JOINT-SYSTEMS OF IRELAND correlated Secondary Systems of Conjugate Joints, as I believe that they can be shown to be simple mechanical consequences of the Primary System (A, C). Neglecting for the present the system (A"', C"'), the whole of the Joints of Waterford may be represented by the following diagram (fig. 1), to which I shall frequently have occasion to refer.

The following Tables give the bearings of all the joints observed, arranged according to their azimuths, together with the locality, and a statement of the rock in which the joint was observed. In each locality several joints of the same bearing were measured but only one is recorded. TABLE I.-East and West Joints in Donegal. No. Bearing. Dip. Locality. Rock. 1 45 N. of E. ......

HAUGHTON ON THE JOINT-SYSTEMS OF IRELAND If we arrange the 64 observations recorded in the preceding Tables according to their azimuths and the number of observations corresponding to each, we shall obtain the following:TABLE III.-Joints of Donegal, arranged according to azimuths and number of observations.

S. of E.,-making a total of 39 in 64, or 61 per cent. of the whole number of observations contained between these two limits. Dividing the N.S. Observations equally between those that lie to the E. and W. of North, we find the following mean azimuths: I. 7? 33' W. of N. from 15g observations =_24 per cent. II. 50 32' E. of N. from 82 observations-=13 per cent. In like manner, dividing the E.W. observations equally between those that lie to the N. and S. of East, we find the following mean azimuths: III. 60 7' N. of E. from 8 observations =12k2 per cent. IV. 70 51' S. of E. from 7 observations _11 per cent.

O' N. of E. from 5 observations = 8 per cent.The accompanying diagram (fig. 2) is a graphical representation of Table III., and shows sufficiently well the five systems of joints that have been deduced from that Table. Of the joints themselves, I. and III., II. and IV. are evidently conjugates, being nearly at right angles respectively, while V. belongs to a system different from the others. Adopting the notation used by me already* in my paper on the Joints of the co. Waterford, and comparing the results there obtained with those here found, we may construct the following Table:Fig. 2. c 20 40 50 / 7 0TABLE IV.-Comparison of the Joints of Donegal and Waterford.

S. IIAUGHTON ON THE JOINT-SYSTEMS OF IRELAND limited number of observed planes, which was 15? in Donegal, and only 7 in Waterford,where this conjugate system is very subordinate in importance. The annexed diagram (fig. 3) shows the Donegal Joints divided into two conjugate systems, (A, C) and (A"', C"'), together with one plane (A') of a third system; all of which are represented in the co. Waterford. Of the whole 64 joints recorded, 44, or 69 per cent., are involved in these five planes; and the number of observations belonging to each is placed beside its designation in the diagram. If we combine together the systems (A, A"') and (C, C"'), we obtain the following as the most simple combination of joints observable in Donegal.Fig. 3. --A-l -; i'-6. *, x *IL, Im II i I I i 0 A f I ll --I ---No. of observations.

Of these systems of joints, 1 and 4, 3 and 6 are evidently conjugates, and neither system closely corresponds with those of Waterford and Donegal, although that named (A, C) comes within a few degrees of (A, C) of those localities.

A very remarkable system of trap dykes penetrating the granite is exhibited in the railway cuttings from the Goragh Wood station to Slieve Gullion, in the Newry Mountains. They are twenty-five in number, and are given in thefollowing Table, numbered in order from Goragh Wood to Slieve Gullion. It appears evident from the Table that they are all reducible to four systems, two of which have directions closely corresponding with the joint-systems (C) and (C') already found.Fig. 5. 4k'I* The magnetic variation of the Mourne district was 25? 40' W.

DE LA BECIJE and other observers have noticed the relation between the directions of the lodes and of the joints in Cornwall. This relation is even more intimate than they supposed, and extends to the Secondary Joints, which are well represented in the mines by the Caunter Lodes, while the Conjugate Joints are represented by the Cross Courses.

These joint-planes may possibly indicate the System (A"-C") observed in the co. Waterford. At Carn Marth 1 found joints bearing 40? W. of N., as in the Mourne Mountains. The relation between the directions of the lodes and joints in Cornwall has been long known. I was desirous of testing it in the Carn Brea district, and therefore asked permission of the officers of Carn Brea, Dolcoath, and North Roskear Mines to make use of their maps for the purpose; the permission was readily granted, and I have here tabulated the results of my investigation.

The only remarkable a aren t as to direction of Joints disclosed by the preceding 3 I2 410 REV. S. HAUGHTON ON THIE JOINT-SYSTEMS OF IRELAND Table, is that between Waterford and Cornwall. If we compare together the primary and secondary joints in each locality, we find the following Table.TABLE XI.-Angle between Primary and Secondary Joints. Waterford. Donegal. Mourne. Cornwall. Fermanagh. Primary (A, C) and First Secondary (A', C') 270 5'1 320 24' 310 46' . ...... 310 1' Primary (A, C) and Second Secondary (A"l, C1) 370 11' ...... 300 56 270 28' ...... This Table discloses a very interesting and unexpected result, viz. that, in Waterford, Donegal, Mourne, and Fermanagh, the angle between the Primary and First Secondary Joint-Systems ranges between the narrow limits of 270 5' and 320 24', and that in Waterford, Mourne, and Cornwall the angle between the Primary and Second Secondary Joint-Systems ranges from 270 28' to 370 11'. I hope to be able to show that this important result of observation is an easy consequence of the mechanical theory of Joints; but before doing so, I shall prove by the following Table, that the theory of Conjugate Joints used in my paper on the co. Waterford applies equally well to the other districts examined by me. TABLE XII.-Angles between Conjugate Joints, measured from East to North. Systems. Waterford. Donegal. Mourne. Cornwall.

PART YI.-MECHANICAL THEORY OF ROCK JOINTS. Rock masses are always arranged in sheets, whose dimensions in two rectangular directions are much greater than in the third direction at right angles to the first two. Hence, when a system of forces acts upon such a mass, its first effect will be to produce a system of'fissures at right angles to the plane of the resultant force. When other forces are subsequently applied to the rock mass, already divided into bands by the parallel fissures, their effect upon these rock bands will be different according as they have a large vertical or large horizontal component. In the first case the bands of rock will simply bend and break across along new fissures at right angles to the original fissures. This cause produces the phenomena of conjugate joints, which have been described and accounted for by several writers, and have been fully discussed by myself in the paper, "s On the Physical Structure of the Old Red Sandstone of Waterford," so often referred to by me. AND CORNWALL, AND THEIR MECHANICAL ORIGIN. 411 I shall therefore direct my attention at present to the phenomena of Secondary Joints, which have been shown to take place along directions inclined at about 300, on each side of the primary direction of the original joints. Let Fig 6 xy, xsy' be the directions of two primary parallel joints, g and let a force P, acting horizontally, tend to produce X a fracture in some unknown direction, ab, making an , s angle 0 with the directions xy, A/y'; if the band of rock were capable of bending, this direction would be at right angles to the direction xy; but if, from the'pressure of superincumbent rock masses, or other cause, it be prevented from bending, it will fracture along the line ab, which is the plane of easiest fracture, and whose direction 0 is thus found. Let K denote the coefficient of cohesion of the rock, I the length of al, and h the perpendicular distance between xy and xry', and let p = tan ?, denote the coefficient of friction of the rock. The mechanical condition of equilibrium is evidently as follows: P cos d=Kl+pP sin 0, or P cos d=si K+A P sin 0.(1) Differentiating this equation, regarding P as a minimum and therefore dP=O, we find -P sin d= Klt osO. P Cos J. (2) Sin2G0 +~Pco Equating the values of P deduced from (1) and (2), we find sin d (sin d+ p cos 0)=cos 0 (cos dp sin ); from which follows cos 2d= sin 20. (3) or cot 20= tanX; and, finally, 2d+A~= 900* e**+** (4) The values of A, determined for various kinds of rock, limestone, sandstone, and slate, vary from 300 to 38?, thus giving for 0 corresponding values from 300 to 260. These values agree very well with the angles between the systems of Primary and Secondary joints determined by the preceding observations in different localities; and I believe that the mechanical cause I have assigned is the true cause of these joints. From this it follows that a single hypothesis as to the direction of a system of forces is sufficient to account for the existence of three conjugate systems of joints, involving six directions; and it also explains the rudely hexagonal jointing of many rocks, if the coefficient of friction be such as to render the angle 0 nearly 300. Many other consequences flow from the preceding investigations, into which I have not time to enter, but which may be readily found and tur~ned to practical use by the field geologist who prefers one hypothesis to many.
