XLIII. An Account of the Success of Agaric in Amputations, &c. in a Letter from Mr. William Thornhill, late Surgeon to the Infirmary at Bristol, to Robert Dingley, Esq; F. R. S. Novem. 2, 1755. I Have made use of the agaric in four amputations: the first was on the arm, between the elbow and wrist; the second and third were below the knee; and the fourth on the crural artery. In every case it answered beyond my expectation; the patients had little or no fever, and no spasms at all, which are frequently the consequences of the ligature, and sometimes fatal. I am surprised, that any objections are made to the use of it. I fear the true reason of its not being used in general practice proceeds from a narrow selfish way of thinking; but it is my opinion it will make its way, to the honour of its first author. I am well satisfied, it is the best medicine in all the materia medica yet discovered for that purpose. I have Read Nov. 13, 1755. [265] I have tried it in female cases, with great success, by injecting a strong decoction of it in haemorrhages from the uterus, and particularly in fluxes of that kind after delivery.
