[306] EXTRACT. `` Mr. Henry Rosewarne, of Truro, says, that `` when he sent the first specimen (presented to the `` Royal Society by me William Borlase, and now `` lodged in their Museum) he mentioned as a proof `` of its being native tin, that between the ore and the `` tin there was a mixture of quartz: but, upon a `` nearer examination and some trials with aqua fortis, `` he and another person found it was not quartz. At `` last, on melting a piece, he perceived no small `` quantity of arsenic to be mixed with it, and there`` fore suspected that the white parts which had `` passed for quartz were nothing but arsenic. Accord`` ingly he scraped off a little of it and put it on a red `` hot iron, where it immediately caught fire, and `` evaporated into smoke, leaving behind it the most `` poisonous stench they ever smelt. This confirmed `` some, who had hitherto doubted, in the most `` firm belief that it really was native tin and genuine, `` it being impossible for tin to be melted and the `` arsenic left untouched.''
