XVII, On the aberrations of compound lenses and object-glasses. By J. F. W. HERSCHEL, Esq. F. R. S. &c. Read March 22, 1821. IT has not unfrequently of late been made a subject of reproach to mathematicians who have occupied themselves with the theory of the refracting telescope, that the practical benefit derived from their speculations has been by no means commensurate to the expenditure of analytical skill and labour they have called for, and that from all the abstruse researches of CLAIRAUT, EULER, D ALEMBERT, and other celebrated geometers, nothing hitherto has resulted beyond a mass of complicated formrnll, which, though confessedly exact in theory, have never yet been made the basis of construction for a single good instrument, and remain therefore totbally inapplicable,.or at least unapplied, in practice. The simplest considerations, indeed, suffice for the correction of that part of the aberration which arises from the different refrangibility of the differently coloured ravs; and accordingly, this part of the mathematical theory of refracting telescopes was soon brought to perfection, and has received no important accession since the original invention of the achromatic object-glass. Indeed the theoretical considerations advanced on this part of the subject by EULER and D'ALEMBERT have even had a tendency to retard its advancemnent, by appearing to establish relations among the relative Mr. J.. -F. W. HERSCHEL Ofl the aberrations, &c. 223 refractive powers of media on rays of different colours which later experimental researches have exploded. In the. more abstruse and difficult part of the theorv of optical instruments which relates to the correction of the spherical aberration, the necessity of an appeal to the powers of algebraic investigation has been all along acknowledged; and as ithe subject is confessedly within its reach and presents none of those difficulties which obstruct our progress in the transcendental analysis., but merely stich as arise from the involved nature of the equations, and the number of symbols which enter into them, it might have been expected that the appeal would, long ere this, have been succes-ful, the artist have bowed to the dictates, lhowever oracular, of a theory which he, was satisfied had its foundation in unerring truth and the result of their combined labours have been the attainment of all the perfection the telescope is susceptible of. Unhappily, however, this is far from being the case. Inva-stiga. tions,it is true, have been accumulated on each other; formula have been deduced, and even tables computed from them; but -the investigations, from their. dry and laborious nature, and the almost total want of that symmetry which is especially necessary int so complicated a subject, have been studied by few; the formula, requiring a more extensive share of algebbraical knowledge than can be expected in a practical optician, are thrown aside by him in despair, and the tables hitherto constructed from theory, being founded on data which may never again occur, are worse than useless, serving only to mislead. In consequence, the best and most success-ful -artists -are content to work their glasses by trial, or by empirical rules, embodying the result of numerous preceding 224 Mr.J. R W. HERSCHE L on the aberrations of trials, and which, therefore, have -probably some analogy to what would be the final results of theory, if presented in a tangible shape, and accommodated to the peculiarities of their construlctions. The object of the following investigations is to remove or lighten these objections, by presenting first of all, under a general and uniform analysis, the whole theory of the aberrations of spherical surfaces; and in the next place, by furnishing practical results of easy computation to the artist, disentangled from all algebraical complexity, and applicable, by interpolations of the. simplest possible kind, to all the ordi nary varieties of the materials on which he has to work. In the execution of the former part of this plan, symmetry and simplicity in the disposal of the symbols, is the object chiefly consulted. To attain this, and at the same time avoid circumlocution in the descriptive part of the processes, I have found it necessary to adopt a language somewhat different from that usually employed by optical writers. Instead of speaking of thefocal lengths of lenses or the radii of their surfaces, I speak of their powers and curvatures, always designating by the former expression, the quotient of unity by the number of parts of any scale which the focal length is equal to; and by the latter, the quotient similarly derived from the radius in question. This mode of expression does no violence to propriety, as the magnifying power of a lens is really inversely proportional to its focal length, and the curvature of a surface is always understood to be reciprocally as its radius; while it gives us tlhe~advantage of expressing concisely and naturally, all the most useful propositions in optics. It is certainly simpler (for example) to say, that "the power of any comcomound lenses. and object-glasses. pound lens is the sum -of the ,powers of its separate component lenses,"' than to express the same thing by saying that "to obtain the focal length of a compound lens, we must divide the product of the focal lengths of its component lenses, by the sum of all the similar products which can .be formed by conmbining them, omitting one in each combination ;" or to announce that I'the power of a lens is equal to a certain coefficient multiplied by the difference of the curvatures of its surfaces," than to assert-thatA" the focal length-is equal to a certain coefficient multiplied by the product of the radii, and divided by their difference." This contractionin language is so convenient, that I hope to see it generally adopted. The formula in the following pages extend no farther than the second term in the developement of the aberration, or that depending on the squares of the semi-apertures. It would have been easy to have carried them to the fourth, and even higher powers; and should object-glasses of very great apertures in comparison with their foca lengths, be ever constructed, it may become necessary; but the dimensions of our present telescopes are far indeed from calling for the immense complexity of algebraic symbols into which this attempt would plunge u-s; not to speak of the tediousness of the numerical computations, where equations of the tenth and higher degrees are to be resolved. The general value of the aberration for any, number of spherical surfaces placed at any finite distances from each other, is assigned by means of an equation of finite differences of the first order. The integration of this presents no difficulty; but I have thought it unnecessary, in the present paper, to pursue it farther in 226 Mr. J. F. W. HERSCHEL on theaberrations of its developement than was required for its application to the theory of thin lenses placed-in contact, and -especially to that of double object-glasses, reserving thetheory of eyepieces, microscopes &c. as well as that of thick lenses for a second -communication, should the Society: honourthis With a place in their Transactions. The problem of the destruction of the spherical aberration in a double or multiple lens, is well known to be indeterminate, the algebraic conditions requisite for that purpose furnishing -but a single equation (at least when, the, mnean rays only are considered). To, fix on the best possible condition for limiting the problem, is a matter of considerable delicacy; D'ALEMBERT has proposed, among others (Opusc. Tom. A, Art. 740)-, to annihilate the spherical aberration for rays of allcolours, a refinement which might almost be termed puerile, were it not for the respect due to so great a name.* It has, besides the inconvenience of leading to equations of the fourth degree. A much better condition, in every point of view, is-another proposed by the same profound geometer, in Art. 758 viz: the destruction of the aberration for an, object situated out of the axis of the telescope; or in other words, the rendering thewhole field of view equally perfect so far as the object-glass is concerned. But even this is perhaps carrying refinement too far. The difference of the aberrations of an object-glass in and out of the centre of the field, isso small in ordinary telescopes, as to have escaped (so far as my enquiries have gone), the notice of the best practical opticians * I pass over the construction proposed by D'ALEMBrRT, in Art. 746, as having no recommendation but that of avoiding a biquadratic equation; though, it is true, -the radii resulting from it might be used. compound lenses and object-glasses. :27 (and I have consulted many) ; nor, of course, has any part of their attention been directed to obviate, experimentally, a source of indistinctness they could not perceive to exist. CLAIRAUT in the Memoirs of the Academy for 1757 has computed the radii of a double object-glass from the condition of their touching throughout the whole extent of their interior surfaces; a very desirable thing in practice, and the curvatures which result are very convenient. CLAIRAUT however has employed in his computations, indices of refriction (1.6oo and 1.55) higher, especially the latter, than what are now easily met with ; and when the average values, such as are likely to occur most frequently, are employed, the construction becomes imaginary for the more dispersive kinds of glass; and within the limits for which it is real, the radii change so rapidly as to render it difficult to interpolate between their calculated values so that to the artist who is no algebraist this construction loses much of its real advantage. There remains a condition unaccountably overlooked (so far as my reading has extended) and which the nature of the formulhe of aberration, as given in the following pages, almost forces on our attention; I mean, the destruction of the aberration not only for parallel rays, or when the telescope is directed to celestial objects, but also for rays diverging from a point at any finite distance. The perfection of the telescope, when directed to land objects, seems to require this ; and though, in astronomical telescopes, it may appear uncalled for, the construction possesses other advantages of so high an order as to recommend it even there: these are, Jst. the very moderate curvatures required for the MDCCCXXI. G g 2X8 Mr. J. F. W. HERSCHEL on the aberrations of surfaces in this respect it, has thei advantage of most, if not all, of the constructions hitherto proposed on theoretical grounds. Ldly. That in this-constructionl the curvatures of the two, exterior surfaces of the compound lens of given focal length vary within extremely narrow limits by any variation in eithertherefractive or dispersive powers at all likely to occur in practice. This remarkable circumstance affords a simple practical rule applicable in all ordinary cases, for calculating the curvatures in any proposed state of the data, and requiring only the use of theorems with which every artist must be familiarand at all events rendering it extremely easy to interpolate between calculated values. 3dly. That the two interior surfaces approach, in all cases, so nearly to coincidence, that no considerable practical error can arise from neglecting their difference, and figuring them on tools of equal radii. Indeed, for a ratio of the dispersive powers a little above the average, they are rigorously coincident, and this construction coincides waith that of CLAIRAUT above-mentioned; and so nearly is this approach to equality of curvature sustained throughout the whole extent of the function, that even when the ratio of the dispersive powers is so low as o.75: 1 (a case almost useless to consider) the difference amounts to less than a 4oth part of the curvature of each. ?

Theory of the foci of spherical surfaces for central rays. Before proceeding to investigate the more complicated cases of the aberrations of several surfaces, we will deduce from the first of these expressions the general equations which determine the place of the focus of central rays after refraction at any number of spherical surfaces; equations we shall have occasion to use hereafter. Let r1, rz, r3, &c. be the curvatures of any number of surfaces A1, A2, A &c. which form the common boundaries of the media o, i, a, a, &c. (fig. 2) and let the relative index of refraction out of the medium o into i be , out of t into a, mand soon; also let ic, (as be the absolute refractive densities or indices of refraction out of a vacuum into these several media, then will ___ .... ......3 IO M 0I r nIm2m ?O mIm2m3 and so on. Moreover, let t2,t3, &c. be the respective compound lenses and object-glasses. .31 intervals between the first and second, the second and third surfaces, and so on; or t-AI A2; tz= As As &c. and letf ,.f2, &c. be the reciprocal distances of the central focus after the ist, 2d, &c. refraction, from the respective surfaces, or the values of A I &c. We here suppose Al qI' A2 q21 the positive values of r to correspond to surfaces whose convexity is turned towards the original radiant Q (provided its distance be positive) while the positive values off indicate a situation of the focus q on the opposite side of the surface. With regard to t, its values are necessarily positive in cases of refraction, but when m =-i, which corresponds to those of reflexion, (which are thus equally included in the present analysis,) t has a negative value. This premised, if we make ID o, or the distance of the radiant point infinite, the focus for parallel and central rays will be assigned by the equation f -(i.-m) . r Let cp denote this value off, and p_(i-m1) r,, &c. then will pl, 2, &c. denote the reciprocals of the principal focal lengths of the several surfaces, in situ, i. e. supposing the adjacent media in each case continued to infinity. We have then in general the equation f -mD. Suppose nowf andf', m and m', d and p' to represent any two consecutive values off, m) and ' in the seriesff.,f3, &c. &c. Then, since the focus after any refraction becomes the radiant point corresponding to the next, we have Dft Mr. J. F. W. HERSCHEL on the aberrations of and the equationsf-I 'm' D' becomes .1c+ tn'f (c) This is in fact an equation of differences between the consecutive values off, and the general value may therefore be obtained by integration, or its particular ones deduced in succession from each other, when the integration is impracticable from the values assigned to A, I, and t. The greatest simplification it appears to admit, is its reduction to an equation of the ?d order and first degree, which may be performed by assuming up I Jr U+ when the equation will become, after the necessary reductions, O=U-(o-ir T U,) +-+z U It will not be necessary to examine particularly all the integrable cases, or to discuss at present the form of the general value of u orf inl terms of I, m, and t. This latter subject is elegantly treated by LAGRANGE in a Memoir '? Sur la Theorie des Lunettes," in the collection of the Academy of Berlin, (Acad. Berl. 1778), to which we may refer. We need only remark that, whatever be its integral, it must necessarily be of the form M-ND O-PD The original distance of the first radiant entering as the arbitrary constant, and being therefore always involved in the same simple algebraic form, whatever be the number and position of the surfaces. 3. Two cases of the equation, however, are worthy of a miore particular examination. The first is, when the number of surfaces is infinite, and the intervals separating them infinitely compound lenses and object-glasses. 238 dimi1nished. In this case the refractive power of the medium varies by insensible gradations; and if we suppose both it and the radii of curvature of the layers of equal density to vary according to a given law, wre shall have both V and r, expressed in functions of the depth to which the ray has penetrated at any moment of its course. This is the case with the crystalline lens of the eye. Dr. BREWSTER'S observations have demonstrated that this humour increases very rapidly in density from the circumference to the centre ; and to apply our general equation to the evaluation of its focal length, we must proceed as follows. Taking x to represent the depth of any layer whose thickness in the middle is dx, the curvatures r and r' of its surfaces will be r and r + dr. We have also, t dx, t'=dx+d2x, taking x for the independent variable. Moreover, since A = i', we have in' = ..2 = iL fk lh+dl & and in consequenice, i-on'_ d-g. Hence we obtain q/( (m') r'= rd, neglecting the products of the infinitely small quantities, so that our equation (c) becomes (sincef' =f + df) f + dfPI<+~ ~d iA1-fdx which developed, retaining only terms of the first degree, gives f + df =f +f2 dxi f o + rM+ or simply, putting c = ev where e= 27182818, &c. o=df+ (f-r) d -.f dx.

Dr. YOUNG has given a solution of a particular case of this difficult problem in his paper on the Mecha. nism of the Eye, in the Phil. Trans. for i8oi, p. 32. 4. The other case of our equation (c) which we proceed to examine, is that, where the surfaces are finite in number, and placed close together, so as to form a compound lens infinitely thin in the middle.

Trhe powers of concave lenses are here regarded as negative, as well as their focal lengths; while the equation (U"') shows that the sum of the reciprocal disc tances of the object and its image is equal to the power, or reciprocal focal length, of the system. 6. These propositions are sufficiently well known, and comprise the whole theory of the central foci of infinitely MDcccxxI. H h 236 Mr. J. IF. W. HERscHEL on the aberrations of thin lenses in contact. Let us next examine how these results will be modified by taking into consideration a small, but finite thickness 'in each of the lenses. To this end we may proceed as follows: If U=o be any equation of differences involving f,f', and t, where t and its values are so small as to permit their powers and products to be neglected; suppose (f) to be the value off deduced from the equation on the supposition that t=o, then in general we may take f-(f) +U where u is a quantity of the same order with t. If this be put forf in U=o, the equation, by developing, and rejecting the powers and products of u and t, will take the form o0 V + W.u + X. u' + Y Ot V, W, X and Y being functions of (f) and (f'), and it is evident that V vanishes by reason of the values assigned to these quantities. There remains then a linear equation of the first order between u and u', which is easily integrated. In the case before us, we have which developed becomes J _'(PI+ mY+ mj2t In this, writing (f) + u forf and retaining only the terms multiplied by u', u, and t, we get and integrating -u= mm3. ...m (f t+n *..

General theory of the aberrations of spherical surfaces for rays incident in the plane of the axis. 7. Let us next proceed to investigate the spherical aberra,tion of any system of surfaces. Suppose the ray, after passing through the nth surface, to be incident on the (n+l ): its aberration here will arise from two causes; i st. that after traversing the n preceding surfaces instead of converging to, or diverging fromt the focus for central rays, its direction was -really to or from a point in the axis, distant from that focus by the total aberration of those n surfaces; and, 2dly that, being incident at a distance from the vertex of the (n+i)th surface, a new aberration will be produced here which (being, as well as the other, of small amount) the principles of the differential calculus allow us to regard as independent of it, and which, being computed separately and added to it, gives the whole aberration of the system of n+1 sUrfaces. 238 Mr. J. F. W. HERSCHEL on the aberrations of The same is true of the small alterations in the values off produced by the aberrations. If we denote by ?f the change in the value off due to the action of the n preceding surfaces by %f, that due to the action of the (n+I )th, and by Af the total change arising from their combined action, we shall have Af= f+ASf Now, 1st. to investigate the partial alteration Yf' in the value off' arising from the total alteration Af in that off, we resume our equation (c); and differentiating its first member according to the characteristic & and its second accordintg to Aw we get (f andf' being the only variables) WtAf O (-Aft) ?dly. to discover the partial variation S'f' of J", arising immediately from the action of the (n+ i)th surface, we have, by the equation (b) writing AS/f for Af, and m', r', D', yV respectively for m, r, D andy, iffy_ Z2 ml (mO,) (r'+ DI)` m' r'+ (I +ml D' but, in this case, neglecting the fourth and higher powers of the semi-apertures, it is easy to see that y'=y (I-ft) and substituting this for y' and fat for D', the equation becomes, /J~t2 . m(1-m') (r1-f-frtt)z;wr iW ~ mt r so that, uniting the two variations, we find On (-ft) = i.m' (1-m' ) (r'-_f-fr10) ,{mt r'-I, f'' (k) If the surfaces be placed close together, or t-o, this becomes Aj'-in'4f ~-Y. in' (i-M') (r'.-f)2 { mn' r'--...in.')f ..(1) compound lenses and object-glasses. 239 but when this is not the case, perhaps it will be found more convenient to use one of the following equations ' A X-ft) f or, Af'f22L.Lsf =2L ( l-m) { r-f-fr't }V.(ri+m'')f) (i') which are derived from it by eliminating t, either wholly or partially from the second member, by the help of equation (c).

If we would destroy the aberration, we have only to put X o. As this cubic equation must have at least one MDcCCXXI. I i 244Mr. J. F. W. HERSCHEL on the aberrations of real root, it -follows that whatever be theproportion of the curvatures of the surfaces of two thitn lenses -placed close together, it is always possible to adjust their focal lengths so as to produce a combination free from sphlerical aberration; and the same is true if the lenses be formed of different materials. To take an example or two; suppose the first and third surfaces on which the light falls to be plane, and wve have a a'= o, and consequently h h h'= o, so that the equation X = o becomes ?7X3+ 33 X2+13X + 27Zz0 whose only real root is x =--1392. Hence, if we take L + i, we have L + L'=+o . So that the power of the compound lens is about 2that of the first glass and of an opposite nature, which, though moderate, may not be-too low to be of some use. If an object be placed in the focus of parallel rays so formed, the rays it sends to every part of the surface will emerge rigorously parallel. Such an object will therefore be seen by an eye on the other side with as much distinctness as if it were a real object at an infinite distance, subtending the same angle, and the combination may thus be used as an eyeglass or magnifier, as well as an object-glass, only reversing its position with respect to the eye. 12. Let a = b'= o, h o, h = 1, or suppose the first and last surfaces plane, and our equation X -o becomes 733 16 x2+ 1 3 x+ 27 0 which has but one real root, x o 8517, or 1L=-L o88517; L+L=_Lx01483 The lenses then must be of opposite characters, but the comnpolund lenses and object-glasses. 245 power of the compoundbeing only about of that of the first lens, is too low to be of service. On the sanme hypothesis as to the plane surfaces, if we trace the variation of the function x we shall find that (I +X3 it admits a minitmnum for a positive value of x given by the equation 37X 2 58 x-68 o ViZ. X = 2-349. This gives L'=_235xL; L+L'Li33^5xL and, Q O'48 4 This is the minimum .value which the ratio of aberrations ad,mits for a positive value of x. The combination is repre. sented inl P1. XIX. fig. 3; and we see that a very material superiority over the best single lens of the same power is the result of s Uch a disposition, the aberration being reduced to less than a fourth part. Even if the plano-convex lenses thus laid together be of equal focus, the value of f, will be 0 only o'6co8, indicating still a sensible advantage gained over any single lens. 13. Let us however take up the problem more generally, and enquire what should be the curvatures of all the four surfaces to destroy the whole aberration in the most advantageous manner with respect to the power of the resulting combination. To this end it is evident, that (thie equation X=o still subsisting) we must also have L + L a maximum, and since we may assume as given the power of the first lens (without which the problem is indefinite), we have dL o and dL'._o, whence, dx=o also, differentiating then the equation X=o, on this hypothesis, we have 246 Mr. J.

The latter being substituted in X~o gives X314XX-. V3125 x + 1=0. all whose roots are real, viz: X -09798, x + o-56og, X= + g8193 The first of these values gives the worst possible mode of correcting the aberration, the second lens almost exactly neutralizing the first. The second destroys the aberration by the application of a correcting lens whose effect in altering the power is the smallest, while the third is that which affords the greatest possible power. If we execute the numerical computations in the two latter cases we shall find the dimensions as follows: 2d Case. 3d Case.

XIX. figs. 4 and 5. Whether we ought or not to aim at the rigorous destruction of the aberration of rays l)arallel to the axis, the use compound lenses and object-glasses. 247 to which the lens is to be applied must decide. In a burning glass it is of the highest importance. A slight consideration will suffice to show, that the difference of temperatures produced in the foci of a double convex lens of equal radii, and one of the same focal length but of the best form, must be very considerable. In order to try whether even the latter might not be improved by the shortening of the focus, and the superior concentration of the exterior rays, by applying a correcting lens of one of the forms above calculated, in spite of the loss of heat in passing through a second glass, I procured two lenses to be figured to the radii assigned in the first column of the foregoing table. They were about three inches in aperture, and when combined as above directed, the aberration wais almost totally destroyed, and probably would have been so completely, had the index of refraction proper to the glass been employed, instead of that adopted in our calculation for brevity. Their combined effect as a burning lens appeared to me decidedly superior to that of the first lens used alone, and there is therefore good reason to presume that the effect of the other construction which, with the same loss of heat, affords a much greater contraction of the focus would be still better, and I regret not having tried it iin preference. 14. In eye-glasses and magnifiers, if we would examine a minute object with much attention, as a small insect, or (when applied to astronomical purposes) if we would scrutinize the appearance of a planet, a lunar mountain, the nucleus of a comet, or a close double star, where extent of field is of less consequence than perfect distinctness in the central point, too much pains cannot be taken in destroying the central aberra248 Mr. J. F. W. HERSCHEL on the aberrations of tion. There is another case in which an aplanatic eye-glass should be employed, viz, in examining the parabolic figure of a specuium, or the perfect adjustment of an object-glass. If the sUrface of the speculum, or object-glass be divided into concentric annuli by diaphragms, covering different parts of it in succession, the rays incident on, these, after crossing 'in their focus will be. spread over corresponding annuli on the surface of the eye-glass, and if the distance between the mirror and eye-glass when adjusted to perfect vision, continue the same for all the annuli, ye conclude that the fixture of the speculum is perfect. It is so how'ever only with respect to that particular eye-glass; and if the aberrations of this be not corrected, all the pains of the artist vill only produce a mirror affected with proportional and opposite imperfections. It is true, the use of a very high magnifying power obviates this objection in great measure, by confining the aberration of the eye-glass within a narrower compass; but it is better in theory, and undoubtedly more convenient in practice, to annihilate it altogether. The aberration in the eye appears to me to be entirely out of the question here, but the consideration of that point would slead us away from the present subject. On the other hand, when a moderately distinct, but extensive field of view is of more consequence than a perfects, bOut confined one, as in spectacles, reading glasses, magnifiers of moderate power, and eye-glasses for certain astronomical purposes, the correction of the aberration in the centre of the field, may be sacrificed with little inconvenience, BY far the best periscopic combination I amn acquainted with, consists of a double convex lens of the best form, but placed in its worst compound lenses and object-glasses. 49 positionj for the lens next the eye, and a plano-concave whose focal length is to thlat of the other as 2r6: 1 or as 13: :, placed in contact with its flatter surface and having its concavity towads the object, as inPL' XIX. fig. 6, for the farthest: yet for destroying the aberration of rays parallel to the axis, nothing-can be worse. In fact our formula (p) gives for the aberration in this construction = 22 3O2 or about 22 times what the best single lens of equal power would give: yet on accidentally combining two such lenses in this manner, I was immediately struck with the remarkableextent of oblique vision,* wlith the absence of fatigue, on reading some time with a powver much beyond that of the natural eye,and with the freedom from colour at the edges of the field, arising from the opposition of the prismatic refractions of the two solids, an advantage which a single meniscus does not possess.

I~ The prfectikn of an object-glass requires that parallel or diverging rays of all clours incident on every point of the glass, should converge to one and the same point, and consequently, that "we should havef invariable and Af zero, for all the colours of the spectrum. With regard to the latter * The foal length of the compound lens tried, was x'8{ inch; the field of tole.rably distinct vision extended full 4o0 from the axis, and the forms of objects were distinguishable (the letters of a hook might be rea ) with management, as far as the 7Sth degree.' The lenses used in this combination should be very thin, and the e-y applied as close as possible. 250 Mr. J. F. W. HERSCHEL on the aberrations of condition, we may content ourselves as already remarked, with annihilating /f for the most luminous rays, but the former must be satisfied as rigorously as possible. To fix the colour of a ray, we may either fix its position in a spectrum cast by a prism of a standard substance, or the length of its fits of easy transmission and reflexion in vacua. The latter method is on all accounts preferable. The whole difference then between the lengths of the fits of an extreme red and violet ray being taken for unity, let c be difference between those of a ray of any assumed colour and those of the most luminous ray in the spectrum, c being positive for rays nearer the red end of the spectrum, and negative for those nearer the violet. Then in different media, the refrac. tive indices [h. pf, &c. for that colour will be functions of c of a form depending on the nature of the media, and which perhaps is not the same for any two media in nature. What this form is in any one medium is at present altogether unknown, but in all, we may represent it by t + (V ) pC+c" + r3+&c. p being the quantity usually termed the dispersive power of the medium, and which even in the most dispersive bodies hitherto observed does not exceed o'4, and is generally a very small fraction, while q, r, &c. are numerical co-efficients, whose influence was perceived shortly after the discovery of the different dispersive powers of bodies, by CLAIRAUT, and whose real existence the experiments of BLAIR, BREWSTER, &c. seem to have placed beyond a doubt. The presumption is that they decrease rapidly in magnitude, and are altogether insensible in the higher terms of the series. compound lenses and obIject-glasess. 251 Let this assumed value of the refractive index be put for p, in our equation f_ (pA) (r-r2) 4.

MDCCCXXI. K k 2.52 Mr. J. F. W. HERSCHEL On the aberrations of an insensible change in the value of f, especially since the greatest value of c very little exceeds 2. Opticians usually regard only the coefficients p, p' &c. which represent the dispersive powers; and the first of our equations (r), which assigns a relation among the powers of the lenses of a very simple nature, has in general been the only one resorted to to insure the achromaticity of the system. It has long however been a subject of complaint, that however perfectly the foci of a double object-glass be adjusted to unite the extreme rays of the spectrum, a, more or less considerable quantity of uncorrected colour remains, which cannot be destroyed by such adjustment. This is obviously owing to the non-proportionality of the quantities of p, q, r, in different media, which renders it impossible to satisfy more than the first of the equations (r), or to what is termed the irrationality of the coloured spaces, in the spectra; and the attention of the optical philosopher has for some tinie past been turned to the discovery of media., in which either this defect of proportionality shall be imperceptible, or else so considerable, as to admit a more perfect correction by the use of three lenses of different media, so adjusted as to satisfy two of the equations. As the co-efficients q, r, &c. furnish equations exactly similar to those afforded by p, it would not be amiss, were they designated in future by the epithet of dispersive powers of the 2d, 3d, and superior orders, and were each medium regarded as having its own peculiar system of dispersive powers of all orders to infinity according to the values of p, q, r, &c. It is almost superfluous to remark on the very interesting field of experimental enquiry which this view lays open, in which however, little progress can be excompound lenses and object-glasses. 253 pected till more rigorous means have been devised of insulating the different homogeneous rays, so as to secure their absolute identity at all times, and under all circumstances, a subject to which I have already devoted some attention, and not altogether without success. i6. In the choice of media, then, for a double object-glass, we must be directed by the condition that their dispersive powers of the first order shall differ considerably. The. equation o = Lp + L'p', the only one we can satisfy rigorously in this case, gives Lo P L =-p/ indicating that the lenses must be of opposite characters, and having their focal lengths in the direct ratio of their disper.. sions. If we call I the power of thle compound lens, and take r= Up the ratio of the dispersions, we get L . ... L -_ . I-, 1We have then only one farther guide to direct us in our choice of media, viz. that the dispersive powers of superior orders shall follow as nearly as possible the same propor-. tion in both media, as those of the first. 17.

Developement and application of the equations for correcting the sperical aberration. i8. The reciprocal distance of the focus of any combination of lenses or spherical surfaces from the posterior surface, is universally resolvable into a series of the form M + Ny2+ Oy4+ Py6+ &c& where y is the semi-aperture, or distance of the point of the first surface on which the ray falls, from-the axis. In order then that this may be rigorously the same for rays incident on every point of the surface, this must be independent of y. and of course we must have N-o, O=o, P-o,&c. In ordinary telescopes however, y is sufficiently small to admit of our neglecting its fourth and higher powers with perfect impunity. Taking the focal length of the telescope for unity, if 'we allow an inch of aperture to every foot of focal length, we shall have Y = 24 y4= Y &c. So that the r i terms bs331776' remaining terms may be safely neglected in our present enconmpound lenses End object-glasses. 255 quiry, and I shall accordingly confine myself to the equation N _ o, or Af = o. If we develope this equation, it will assume the form oS + T. D+ U.D where S, T, U are functions of the, curvatures and powers of the lenses. Now as the telescope may be directed to objects at all different distances, D is arbitrary and independent, and in consequence, the above equation must be satisfied, if possible, independent of D. This gives the three equations So, T = o, U = 0, or, obtaining the values of these quantities from our equation (o) o=-WLA + ,u'2 A { 'B1 L + C' Lo}(t +&c.

In this equation it will be observed, the quantities r, r', &c. relative to the several lenses are not combined with each other by multiplication, nor do they rise above the second degree. If then we assume, or determine from other conditions the powers L, L, &c. the equation takes a form of great simplicity. Now, as we have already seen, the, destruction of the chromatic aberration depends on relations between the focal lengths only, without any regard to the curvatures of the surfaces, and therefore furnishes equations tending to this very point. It is a singular circumstance, and it cannot but be regarded as a very fortunate one, that the introduction of compound lenses and object-glasses. 257 another condition quite independent of the correction of the spherical aberration, and which at first sight seems likely greatly to increase the difficulty of the investigation, should on the contrary tend so remarkably to simplify itU In general, when the focal lengths are assumed, there will be as many unknown quantities r, r', &c. as there are lenses, and the aberration for parallel rays may therefore be destroyed in a great variety of ways, some more, some less advantageous. If, for example, we limit the figure of one of the lenses in any way (as if we assume it plano-convex or concave,) or assign equal curvatures to both its surfaces, &c. such limitation is equivalent to assigning given values to both its radii, and the terms depending on that lens in equation (w) pass into the given part of the equation. 20. Let us next consider the equations (u) and (v). The latter does not involve the radii of the lenses, but only their powers, being in fact when developed. o= (2m+3) L + (2n'+3) L'+ (Qm -i-3) L+ &C; (X) In a double object-glass, this equation will be incompatible with the equation o=p L+IX' L' expressing the condition of achromaticity, and must of course be sacrificed, the latter being of paramount importance.* It is in fact a very secondary consideration to satisfy this condition in telescopes. In the microscope, however, where D is necessarily a quantity Unless such a peculiar adjustment of the media should take place as to render the two conditions identical, which would give or zm+3 zo,/-3 3iA+Z 3z+Z it is a mere matter of curiosity to look for media satisfying this equation.

If we combine the least dispersive flint with the most dispersive crown or plate glass which have yet been observed by DOLLOND, BoscoviCH, ROBISON, BREWSTER, &c. and vice versa, we shall find o0i and 0-782 for the minimum and maximum of this quantity; but it is rare to meet with the extremes. Mr. TULLEY was so good as to communicate to me the highest and lowest dispersions of the two sorts of glass, which had occurred to him in the compound lenses and object-glasses, 259 course of his practice, and calculating on these, I find o056915 and oG6567 for the corresponding values of . -a, so that we may fairly take o 6o for its average value. With regard to I and p', their limits are much narrower. In crown and plate glass, we have 15o4 and i1544 for the extreme indices, while in flint 1P5735 and XP625 are the lowest and highest I have met with any account of. TULLEY'S extremes are 1P5735 and 1'S99, and it is said to be very rare at present to meet with flint higher than 'Goo. In one specimen only have -I observed a greater refraction, We may therefore fix on 1P524 and P585 for the mean or average values of p1 and p'. In order however to embrace a greater range of the function, should we be desirous of interpolating, as wvell as to provide for the possible discovery of a mode of makiing flint glass of high dispersive power free from veins, (a thing which it seems very reasonable to hope, and which the recent liberality of Government in affording facilities to experiments on a large scale for this express purpose, gives us some ground to expect) I have computed the coefficients of our equations (z) and (A) for values of -a from o So to o075 inclusive, and the results are presented in the following tables.

Trhis table aand the p.receding afford room for one or two remarks of some moment. And, first, with regard to the 263 Mr. J. F. W. HERSCHEL on the aberrations of putting together of the-lenses, it wvill be observed that for the lower values of iw, or the more dispersive varieties of flint-. glass, the curvature of the third surface is a very little greater than that of the second, so that the glasses when laid together in their proper position will have a minute interval between them. At a certain value of -a between ?.55 and o-o (w-o~gS8 nearly) this interval vanishes, and the glasses are in contact over their whole surface. For higher dispersive ratios, if laid close together, they would touch in the vertex. This is regarded as an objection in practice, and justly, (especially when the curvatures of the surfaces in contact differ considerably) as their pressure on each other at the centre must tend to distort their figures, and disturb the uniformity of their density, not to speak of the production of the colours of thin plates, whose effect on vision is more probleinatic. But in fact, the difference of the curvatures in this construction is so very trifling, as to fall within the limits of practical errors, and therefore, if the separation of the two glasses by a ring of metal (which in a io feet object-glass, of 5 inches aperture, even in the very unfavourable case of '-o0-7o need not exceed I-ooth of an inch in thickness) be deemed un-advisable, it may be neglected, and the glasses ground to the samne radius, provided only the necessary alterations are made in the other surfaces to preserve the proper proportion of their focal lengths. 26. With regard to the interpolation of the tables above given for intermediate values of wr; if wve cast our eyes down the second and 5th columns, we cannot but be struck by the very small alteration in the values of r, and r4, the curvatures of the first and last surfaces throughout the whole useful compound lenses and object-glasses. 263 extent of the table, i. e. as far as z-o'7o, (beyond which it is very unlikely it should ever extend in practice). In fact, these values have, the one a maximum and the other a mininum between wr=O 55 and rv=ao6o. The principal variation takes place on the values of r2 and r3, which change rapidly as w increases, the whole stress of the adjustment by which the aberration is corrected being laid on these surfaces. We may take advantage of this fortunate and very remarkable circumstance, and assigning to r, and r4 constant values, such as to give the least average error, employ them to complete the interior curvatures: thus we may announce it as a practical theorem, which in all probability will be found sufficiently exact for use, that a double object-glass will be free from aberration, provided the radius of the exterior surface of the crown tens be 6 720, and of the flint I 420 the focal length of the combination being i o-coo, and the radii (f the interior surfaces being computedffrom. these data, by the formula given in all elementary works on optics, so as to make the focal lengths of the two glasses In the direct ratio of their dispersive powers. 27. It remains to examine the effect of a change of the values of S, and 1.p' on the curvatures. Now the variations to which these quantities are subject being very trifling, we may neglect their squares and products, and we shall have dr Vd + d-, d dr r~~r r where and a are constant co-eflicients, which are most readily computed by repeating the preceding calculations for -values of V and V! a little differing from those before assumed. And first, with respect to d-: if we take A= i 5 and 264Mr. J. E W.
