The Specifick Gravities of several Metalline Cubes, in comparison with their like Bulks of Water. By Mr. Fr. Hauskbee, F. R. S. THese Cubes were deliver'd to me by Dr. Sloane, and supposed to be extraordinary in their several kinds, except the Gold. Their workmanship was very accurate; and they were exactly of a size, altho' they differ'd a little from our Measure. Six of them being laid on a Rule, Side by Side, measured about a tenth more than 6 Inches; and if their Sides were chang'd, they still made the same measure. And it farther apappeared that they were exact, by their agreeableness in the Weight of their respective Bulks of Water, as may be observed by comparing them in the following Table. <inferred>Troy</inferred> (512) Troy Weight.
