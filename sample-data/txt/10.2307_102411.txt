(781) II. An Account of a Negro-Boy that is dappel'd in several Places of his Body with White Spots. By Will. Byrd, Esq, F. R. S. T H E R E is now in England, in the Possession of Captain Charles Wager, a Negro-Boy, of about Eleven Years Old, who was born in the upper Parts of Rappahanock River, in Virginia: His Father and Mother were both perfect Negroes, and Servants to a Gentleman of that Country, one Major Taylor. This Boy, till he came to be Three Years Old, was in all Respects, like other Black Children, and then without having any distemper, began to have several little White Specks in his Neck and upon his Breast, which, with his Age, have since been observed to increase very much, both in Number and Bigness; so that now from the upper part of his Neck (where some of his Wool is already turn'd White) down to his Knees he is every where dappel'd with White Spots, some of which are broader than the Palm of a Man's Hand, and others of a smaller Proportion. The Spots are wonderfully White, at least equal to the Skin of the fairest Lady, and have the Advantage in this, that they are not liable to be Tann'd. But they are, I think, of a Paler White, and do not show Flesh and Blood so lively through them as the Skin of White People, but possibly the Reason of that may be, because the Skin of a Negro is much thicker. This Boy never had any Sickness, but has all along been very Sprightly and Active, and has more Ingenuity too, than is common to that Generation. His Spots grow continnally larger and larger, and 'tis probable, if he lives, he may in time become A a a a a a all (782) all over White; but his Face, Arms and Legs are perfectly Black.
