Read December oS, *179te It is well known to Astronomers that the ring of Saturn be c<:mes alternately enli;htened on one of its sides, and that this change of illumination takes place when the planet passe$ throughthe llode of the ring. This happened in Octoberv oy8, when tlle southern plane, which had been ill the dark for about fifteen years, becalne visible to us: all everlt to vvhich I have looled forwards with considerable impatietlce. In the year 79e, the position of the ring vvas still too oblique to permit ne to exatnine it svell enough to forln a proper judgment of its appearance9 btlt lately I have beerl able to view it to greater adrrantage, witll every olae oftny telescopes.

Outside diameter 75lo Inside diameter of the largest ring 7740 Outside diameter 8qSoo Breadth of the inner ring 805 l3readth of tlae outer ring 280 Breadth of the vacant space X ,, Admitting, with M DE LA LANDE, tllat the breadth of the whole ring, as formerly.supposed t;o corlsist of one entire mass, is near one third of the Eliameter of Saturn, it follows that the vacant space between the tvvo rings, accordin-g to the above statement, amounts to near 2513 miles In giving these proportions, which are merely taken from very accurate representations of the phnomena that offered themselves, I do not mean to be scrupulously exact, but reserve a greater accuracy for a filture opportunity; ntllen a: micrometer, which I have lately applied to the 40-feet tele scope, will assist me to have recourse tc) proper measures. It may be remarked, that this opening in the ring must be of considerable service to the planet, in reducing the space that is eclipsed bat the shaclow of the ring to a lnuch smaller compass; both on account of the direct light it lets through, and because there will be a strong reverberation of the rays of the sun between the two opposite edges Moreover, if these rings should be surrounded by some atinosphereX wllich is highly probable, the refractions that will take place UpOll the edges will still contribute xto lessen the darkness which the shadow of arl undivided ring mTould have occasioned. As s^re have now adrnitted Saturn to-have two rirlgs en tirely detached from each other, so as plainly to permit us to Dr. HERSCHEL S Observatzos oxÂ¢see the opell heavens through the vacancy betweerz them; and as in my fortner paper I learre given the revolution of tlae ring, which w as then supposed to be all in one united tnass it will be necessary to examine, whether t3oth rings partake in the same revolutiorl, or to vzhich the period whicil has been assiglled belorlgs ? To decide this point, we must recur to the observations of the spots by which the rotation of the ring uras determined. Tlle spot called , for instance, whicll has been observed to renrolve with great regularity through upwards of goo periodsX betweenet;he 28th of July and the 24th of December, z789, was certainly situated pretty near the outer edge. The spot ,(3, as may be gathered from the observatiorl of the 16tll of September and eSth of December, was most likely otl the very edge itself; nor could the spot R be far from it. This, without con sidering the situation of y and ;, is quite sufficient to determine us to assign the peried vvre have gisTen to belong to the large, thin and narrow outward ring. The spots y and E were probably at some distance from the oututard edge of the outer ring; but this distance might possibly not exceed thrct of the inside edge of the same ring. \Ve may however adluit thern to have adhered to the inner rings whose rotationDis ?erhaps not very diffierent from that of the outer olle; or we may examine whether these tsro spots may not perhaps agree to some other supposed revolution of the inner ring; but then the observations that are given ofthemwill hardly be sufficient for establishing the time of that ring's rotation with accuracy, though they urldoulttedly must amount to a proof that it also revolves witli great volocity on its axis. ^ See Phil. Trans. Vol. LXXX. page +ss. the Ring o;92 Satllrn;7Tllat there should be a small difference in the periods of the rotation of the two rings, is highly probable from their different dimensions; and nosr, that the rotation is known, the division of it into two parts seems to be a very natural conse quence of its construction. For) when the extreme thinness is taken into consideration, sve firld by KEPLER)S law, of the periods of revo]ving bodies placed at different distances, that it vould be very wonderful for so thin, and so broadl a plane, to 11ave adhesion enough to keep together; and that colasequerltly this ring irl its divided state, supposing the rotation of the parts to favour the corlstruction, is more perrnanent than it would be otherwise. This however is only mentioned as a collateral circumstance, and by no means intended e;ther as a proof of the division, or the ditierent rotation ofthe two parts of the ring. For, notwithstatldirlg we cannot but set tlle lzighest value upon the excellent theories that have beeIl lately delivered in the Memoirs of a learned Society, of which I also have the honour to be a lnemberv wMe must refer entirely to obsersration for the necessary data on which to found our subsequetlt computations. tlthe memoir to vwthich I allude $ refers to obsers7ations of many divisions of tlae ring of Saturn. This tnust lead us to coxlsider tlae question, whether the constructioll of this ring isof a nature so as permanently to remain in its present state ? or whether it be liable to continuaI and frequet changes, ir such a manner as in the course of not many years, to be seer subdiVided illtO narrow slips, and thetl again as united into orse or two circular planes only ? Now, without eraterig into a discussion, the mind seems to revolt, even at first sight * See Histoire de l'Academie Royale des Sciences de Paris, 1787 page +9. Dr. HEXSCHEL9S Qbservations onagainst arl idea of the chaotic state in which so large a mass as the ring of Saturn must needs be, if phnomena like these can be admitted. Nor ought we to indulge a suspicion ofthis j3eing a reality,unless repeated and well-confirmed observations had proved beyond a doubt, that this ring was actually in so fluctuating a conditiorl Let us therefore examitle ahhat facts we have to guide us in this inquiry. After lookitag over all my observations upon Saturn, since the year 177+ to the present timen I carl find only four vvhere any other black division upon the ring is mentioned than the one which I have constantly observed, and from svhich I have deduced the actual division of tlle ring into two very unequal portiotls. These observations are as follows. June 19, z780. loh o5t mean time.

It must be cc3nfessed that Sat;urn BrS in the very best situa t-vn for vlewing the plalle of the ring, NVltlEll the first four observations were 7lade; anct that colasequently tlley may-be looked uporl as a strong evidence for another dierision. Btlt hitherto I have set tlaem aside as vv7anting nlore confirmation not only because I could llever perceiere the sane dark line on the follosving side of the ring as srell as on the preceding side; nor since I could not find it on the 2gth of June, 17So, as sve have seell above; but cllieiSyn because I have llot been ableX svith any of lny best instrulxlents, to see it at,ain at all tWe also find by the observation of the 2ISXC of NQVein1)erX 1791 which llas been added, t3at tlle southern plalle, as yet, preseilts us with no otller division than the capital olle, svhich I have observed these thirteen yearsg on both sides of the ritlg. Ilosv ever, iS the opening should be very narrown and tlle rings ecceatrics it is possible that a dark line migllt by tllis lneans become visit31e ola one side ollly.Moreover, these objects may be so mintite, that no other time than when tIze plane of the ring is exposed as mtlcll as it can possiluly be will do to ascer tain sucll phstlonlena. This will happen again about the year o796, when wte mayA 11ope to have a satisfactory view of itX with our large instruments. It retnains now to consider the observations that have been made by M. CASSINI, Mr. SHORT, arld Mr. AH[ADL:EY. Witllollt beitzg in possession of the original observatiotzs of MDCC XCI I # C lDr. HERSCHELSS Observations ag10M[. CASSINI, I cannot decide whether the black list svhich he saw was the same which I htve observed M. DE LA LANDE says (Ast. Vol. III . page 441.) that CASSINI saw it divided by a small black line into two equal parts. 1M[. DE LA PLACE (Memoire sur la Theorie de l'Atzaneau de Satllrne) lnentions tllat CASSINI saw the breadth of the rirlg dierided into two parts almost equal ItS should seem from tlois, that WI. CASSINI N&ELS not partictllarly attentive to the proportiorls of the divisionL; in which case his observations and mi<e will agree perEectly nTell; but if lle has arly where expressly melltioned, that the ring was divided into eqval parts, so that we may be certain he was particularly attentive to that circulnstance, it will follow earidently that the ring, since his tiine, laas ulldergope a very ca pital change in its construction. Mr. SHORT assured M. DE LA LANDE, that he had seen many divisions upon the ring, with his telescope of 12-feet. A thing of such consequerlce, and so new, ought certairlly to have been given in a more satisfactory and circumstarltial svay than only by communicating it, frozn memory, in conversation, to another person. Besides, it is nfell known that many telescopes will give double and treble imagesX and that especially t+hose thich have large apertures are subject to tremors, which multiply sm(ll lines. For these reasonsy we can hardly take into account observations that seem rlot to be sufficiently establishedO What has been said is, however by no tneans -illtended to un dervalue MrW SHORT'S observations; and this, I hopen will be evident, when it is remembered how scrupulously I have 3ust before set aside four of rny own, becavlse I looked upon theln a-s not sufficiently confirmed. Mr. HADLEY'S observation of the division of the ring, with a tZbe Rlng of SatllrnG-feet Nevvtoniarl reflector, wllich w<is certainly a very ex cellent instrument, agrees perfectly well with minee From svhat has beekl said, it does not appear to me that there ls a sufficient ground for admltting the ring of Saturn to be of a very ehangeable nature, and I guess that its ph-rlomena will Anereafter be so fully explained, as to reconcile all observations. I-rl the mean wllile, we must withhold a ISnal judgluetat of its corstruction7 till wJe can have more observations. Its divisiol however9 into two very unegual parts, can admit of no =doubt; and the following are measures taken of the diameter of the largest or outn7ard ring. Oct. 7, 791.

In my frequent observations of the Saturnian system, I reÂ° marked, that the ,th satellite is subject to a change of brightness. This having been noticed before by other obserxTersn I did not at first pay so much attention to it as I soon afterwards foutld this circuxustance desersred. When I sawv this satellite always assume tlle same brigllttzess in the same part of it-s orbit, and perceived that its change was regu]ar atld periodical, it occurred to me very naturally, that the cause of this plllomenon could be no other than a rotation upon its axis. It becatne necessary therefc)re to find out a methocl to deterrllirle the time of this rotation. In order to itlvestigate this, I pursued the satellite with great attention, and marked all its changes of a-pparent hrightness. The result of many observations is as follows. The light of the satellite is in full splendour during the titne it runs through that part of its orbit which is betsveen 68 and z2g degrees past the inferior conjunction. In passillg through this arch it does not fall above one magnitude short of the brightS ness of the 4*th satellite. On the contrary, from about 7 de * In this calculation I have llsed for the tarth's diameter the sum of the longer and shorter semi-axes which are given in Mr. DALB-Y'S Paper, published in the last volume of the Philosophical Transactions. If 77e compute ttle vacant space between the two rings immediately from the above dimerssions of the outward ring9 we shall have z839 miles; and this will certainly be more accllrate than the resule which has beer drawn from the proportion of the breadth of the rillg to the dlameter of Saturna Dr. HERSGHEL}S Observations on t}3e4greesXpast the opposition till towards the inferior conjlluctions it is not only less bright than the Sd? but hardly, if at all ex ceeds the 2ds or even the 1st satellite; provided the latter be then aboul; its greatest elongatiol where its light is least iln peded by tlne brightness of the planet. Upon the whole, the alteration seelus to amoulat to what among the fixed stars, and nvith tlle naked eye, would be called a charlge from tlle th to the 2dn and from the 2d to theSth magnituEle. Havillg thus observed this satelliten for many of its rerrolu tions round tlle primary planet to lose arld regain its light regularlyn it is evident that the time of its rotation on its axis cannot differ mucll from that of its revolution round Sattlrl1. I think myself sufliciently authorized to make this collclusion notwithstanding it may have happened sometimes that the light of tlle satellite has suffered an occasiollul change of short duration, from other causes; for the sarne reason that ^ve should certainly allour those who first saw the spots in the sun to be in tlle right to assigrl the period of its rotation nevrly s?herl they perceiered that the same spot made several revolutionsX notwithstanding that spot might afterxvards vanish. But I may go farther, and ascertain upon sufEcient grounds, that this satellite turns once upon its axis, exactly in the time it performs one revolution round its primary planet. Thisdegree o-f accuracy is obtained by taking in the observations of M. CASSINI, which are related intthe Memoires cZe l'Xcademie desSciences, 1 yo$, page 121; wherewe finditmentioned, that c; the Sth satellite of SaturnLdisappears regularly fbr about one <<; half of its revolution, when it is to the east of Saturn.s The same nwemoir contains also a conjecture of this satellites rotation upon its asis; but this surmise is contradicted X prema Wotation of theb Satellite of Saturrature, in 1707, page 36; where we; find the following paraJ ... graph. " 1M. CASSINI gives an example of the danger there is s; in these sort of determillatiorls that are made too hastily. s; The th satellitet of Saturn, of wluich we laave said, in the c; History of r70S, page 21, tllat it grew invisibles in the sc eastern half of the circle it describes ahout Saturn, begany '; in tlhe month of Sept. 7o$ to be there visible, as well as in ac; the western half., where it alvv-ays wasso. Hence the concc jectures which we have related cease to be well founded*') Nosv vithout determining whether the satellite, from somew cause or other, ceased to charlge its brightness, or whether its phxnomexla were not sufficiently followed to come to a proper conclusions I thirlk that with the assistance of observations at so great a distalace of time as those of M. CASSINI I may suXi cierltly establish the period of this $atellite's rotation For since I have traced the regular, and periodical change of lighty through more than ten revolutiorls) and find them, in all appearance, to be contemporary with its return about Saturn, lt leads us directly to a strong presumption that its rotation upon its axisn like that of our snoon, strictly coincides with its revolution round its primary planet; and the observatlons of M. CASSINI completely confirm this conclusiorl For, had he seen tlie satellite brightest in any other part of its orbit, our observations would not have agreed together; but since thev year 170tS, the satellite has made abollt 397 revolutiorls; and yet the phxnomena described by CASSINI answer now as exactly to my own obserfirations, as the spots in our moonw viewed in CASSINI'S time, answer to those we now observe If it should be objected, that tlle ,gth satellite of Saturll has not beerl continually observeds and that consequently these apD94. HERSCHEL)S obsersations on thepearances lnight either not happen at all, or fall upon diXerent places in its orbit; I ans-Wer that a period of more thaxl ten revolutions, which I have inclucIed, is already a strong argutnent that n-o such cllange has taken place; for if the satellite had but made a single lot-ation upon its axis more or less than it has made revolutions round Saturn, tlae chalzg;e must aluourlt to nearly one degree per revolution; that is, to about ten de grees during the tilne of my taking notice of it; which is a quantity I think I might have perceived. Houzever, to retnove a11 doubt) we have some valuable observatiolls of M. BERNARDS who in the year 178y, aIso found the ,Sth satellite of Saturn subi;ect to the same change of light that M. CASSINS had observed. e Now, by joinirlg those to mine, vve have a short period of near 20 revolutions that agree together, so as to preclude all doubt of any intermediate challge; and tllerefore Mre cannot be liable to err, when nve extend this period to all the 397 reYO1UtiOnS SinGe CASSINI}S tilne, and by that rneans ascertain that the tll satellite of Saturnw turns upon its axis, once in y9 days, y hours) and 4y mintltes I cannot llelp reflecting, with sotne pleasure) on the discovery of an analogy, svhicla sheuTs that a certain, uniform plan s carried Oll among the secondaries of our solar system; and we zmay conjecture, that probably nost oI Xche znoons of all the planets are governed by the same law; eslzecially if it be fownded on such a corlstruction of the figure of the secondariesR as makes thern zmore ponderous towards their primary planetsw lSor) if errerl the Sth satellite of Saturns which is at so great a distarlce from its planet, is affiected by such a law of course the other satellites are not very likely to have escaped its inflLuenceG * See Memoires de l'Xcadenziea I786, page 378 Rotation of tbe Jifth SatellzZe of Saturn.7Fronz the considerable charlge in the brightness of the th satellite of Saturn, we tnay be certain that sotne part of its surface, atld this by far the largest, reflects tnuch less light thall the rest; a-rld, frortl the points of its orlbit in which it appears brightest to us, we conclude that neither the darkest nor brightest side of the satellite is turned towards the planet, but partly one and partly the other; though prO?tbly ratlaer less of tlae bright side The great regularity of this cllange of brightness seenals to point out another resernblance of tllis satellite with our moon, It is well knowla t]lat vre see the spots of the moon pretty nearly of the same brightness so as tzot to le overcast in a very strong degree by detlse clollds to disfigure them, and therefore haste great reason to surmise that ller atmosphere is extremely rare; which indeed we also know from otllet principles: Irl like tnanner, on account of the utlinterrupted changes in the brightness of the 5th satellite of Saturn, we may suppose that it also partakes of a silnilar fate with respect to its atmosphere, vvhicll is probably as rare as that of our noon.

In the last six measures of the sth satellite, I used a rnethod a very little diSerent from that which I eanployed before) and which is probably more accurate. I used to obsersre, when the Distarlce of tbe ph Satellite tf Satarn. 21 two wires were nearly brought to their proper distance the moment of interwetion of the satellite ; and the instant it wtas hid behind the svire cast my eye on Saturn which should 1ze bisected when the tneasure is justly taken. 13ut this change of attention cannot be made without sotne very small loss of time. To correct this defict I took alterllately the bisection of Saturn, and cast my eye upon the satellite; arld the bisection of the satellites castilzg the eye upon Saturn. As the latter way gieres the irlterval too smalls the forlner gives it too large, and between both the true measure tnay be obtained. I do not, however, suppae, that the error of the former method can amount to so much as a single sewnd of space; as, knowing the loss of time, Ialways used the uttnost precaution; and repeated the examination of a measure perhaps 20 times before I let it pass C)ct. ls t>t Arrection of be clock-2t GO't,0t e2h2G1 sst measure 9t 43tt,767 22 27 2d 9 44 444 22 30 sd 9 4g ,ooy 22 32 th --"i 9 42 ,09 22 34. sth 9 40 ,M4 22 36 6th 9 + ,g65 9t 4g/',o mean of the six : measures. s It grew cloudy, so tilat no measures later in the night could be obtained ; nor could I get another sight of Saturn till October the 7th, when the tellite was fir aderanced in its orbit) on its return towards the planet. Supposing the satellite to have been very nearly at its 22 lDr HERSCHEL'S Observations, &C. greatest elongatiotl, uthen the last six measures were takerl, I have reduced them t-o theAmean distance of Saturn where they give 8' g",97. I forbear making deductions from this result, with respect to the quantity of matter contained in th;e planet, as9 possibly9 the orbit of the satellite may 1)e corlsiderably elliptical; in urhich case measures taken in opposite parts of that orbit vill be required, be:fore ^w-e can rnalie a strict application of the laws of centripetal forcest PAt7Sa.e SrS7".Â¢TnA T X s(i\'l2rfS-.oct-y t-/Y ozs
