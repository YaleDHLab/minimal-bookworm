[336] XLIV. Extract of a Letter from Rome, to M. Maty, M. D. Sec. R. S. on the extraordinary Heats observed there this last Summer. Rome, August 27, 1768. A S I remember, when Mr. Mwas here, he seemed desirous to ascertain the degrees of heat and cold; I cannot help mentioning the excessive heat of this summer, which is much greater than has been known in Rome for many years. Friday, the 19th instant, the mercury in a well-regulated thermometer according to Fahrenheit's scale, exposed at a North window, where there was no sun and very little reflection, stood from ten o'clock in the morning until about five in the evening at ninety-nine. About half an hour after sunset it fell to ninety, and at midnight was fallen to eighty-five, where it remained all night. This is the hottest day we have had, but for these three weeks past at midday the mercury has been always above ninety four, and at midnight seldom under eightythree, which is the more extraordinary as I do not remember to have observed any other summer above eighty-nine at midday, nor above seventy-five at midnight. Notwithstanding this great heat, there was never a more healthy summer at Rome; all the hospitals are almost empty. James Byres. XLV. An Read December 15, 1768.
