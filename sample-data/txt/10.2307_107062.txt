PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTION S. XIX. Experiments on the solar, and on the terrestrial Rays that occasion Heat; with a comparative View of the Laws to zwhich Light and Heat, or rather the Rays wbich occasion them, are subject, in order to determine whether they are the same, or diferent. By YWilliam Herschel, LL. D. F. R. S. PART II.* Read November 6, i8oo. IN the first part of this Paper it has been shewn, that heat derived immediately from the sun, or from candent terrestrial substances, is occasioned by rays emanating from them; and that such heat-making rays are subject to the laws of reflection, and of refraction. The similarity between light and heat, in these points, is so great, that it did not appear necessary to noticesome small difference between them, relating to the refraction of rays to a certain focus, which will be mentioned hereafter. But the next three articles of this Paper will require, that while we shew the similarity between light and heat, we should at * For the First Part of this Paper, see page 293. MDcGMc. 3 L 4I38 Dr. IkRSCUELS Experimeizts on the solar, and the same time point. out some striking and substantial differences, which wvill occur in our experiments an the rays which occasion them, and on which hereafter we may proceed to argue, when the question reserved for the conclusion of this Paper, whether light and heat be occasioned by the same or by different rays, comes to be discussed. ARTICLE iv.-Dfferent Refrangibility of the Rays of Heat. We might have included this article in the first part of this Paper, as a corollary of 'the former three; since rays that have been separated by the prism, and have still remained subject to the laws of reflection1 and refraction, as has been shewn, could not be otherwise than of different refrangibility; but we have something to say on this subject, which will be found much more circumstantial and conclusive than what might have been drawn as a consequence from our former experiments. However, to begin with what has already been shewn, we find that two degrees of heat were obtained from that part of the spectrum which contains the violet rays, while the full red colour, on the opposite side, gave no less than seven degrees ;* and these facts ascertain the different refrangibility of the rays which occasion heat, as clearly as that of light is ascertained by the dispersion and variety of the colours. For, whether the rays which occasion heat be the same with those which occasion the colours, which is a case that our foregoing experiments have not ascertained, the arguments for their different refrangibility rests on the same foundation, namely, their being dispersed by the prism; and that of the.irays of light being admitted, the different * See ad and 4th experiments, pages z58 and 259. on the terrestrial Rays that occasion Heat. refrangibility of the rays of heat follows of course. So far then, a great resemblance again takes place. I must now point out a very material difference, which is, that the rays of heat are of a much more extensive refrangibility than those of light. In order to make this appear, I shall delineate a spectrum of light, by assuming a line of a certain length; and, dividing it into seven parts, according to the dimensions assigned to the seven colours by Sir ISAAc NEWTON) in the -fourth figure of the second part of his Optics, I shall represent the illuminating power of which each colour is possessed, by an ordinate drawn -to that line. And here, as the absolute length of the ordinates is arbitrary, provided they be proportional to each other, I shall assume the length of that which is to express the maximum, equal to 3of the whole line. Trheus let GQ * represent the line that contains the arrangement of the colours, from the red to the violet, Then, erecting on the confines of the yellow and green the line LR = 27 of GQ, it will represent the power of illumination of the rays in that place. For, by experiments already delivered, we have shewn that the maximum of illumination is in the brightest yellow or palest green rays. ? From the same experiments WG collect, that the illuminations of yellow and green are equal to each other, and not much inferior to the maximum; this gives us the ordinates K and M. Then, by the rest of the same experiments, we obtain also the ordinates H. I, N, 0, P., with sufficient accuracy for the purpose here intended. All these being applied to the middle of the spaces which belong to their respective colours, we have the figure GRQG, representing what may be called the spectrum of illumination. *See Plate XX. t Se page Z6z. 3L 9 44O~Dr. HERSCILPS EXPeriments on the sotar, and We are now, in! the same manner, to find a figure to express the heating power of the refracted prismatic rays, or what may be called the spectrum of heat. In order to determine the length of our base, I examined the extent of the invisible rays, and found, that at a distance of two inches beyond visible red,, my thermometer, in a few minutes, acquired 1 , degree of heat. The extent of the coloured spectrum at that time, or the line which answers to GQ in my figure, measured z,97 inches. If twoinches had been the whole of the extent of the invisible part, it might be stated to be in proportion to the visible one as 2 to q; but we are to make some allowance for a small space required beyond the last ordinate, that the curve of the heating power drawn through it may reach the base; and indeed, at 2m inches beyond visible red, I could still find A degree of heat. It appears therefore sufficiently safe, to admit the base 'of the spectrum of heat AQ, to be to, that of the spectrum of light GQ, as gto 3 ; or, conforming to the NEWTONIAN figure before mentioned, the base of which is 3,3 inches, as 573 to 33. Now, if we assume for the maximum of heat, an ordinate of an equal length with that which was fixed upon for the maximum of light, it will give us a method of comparing the two spectra together. Accordingly, I have drawn the several ordinates; B, C, DI E, F, G, H., I, K.L, M, N, O P., of such lengths as, from experiments made on purpose, it appeared they should be, in order to express the heat indicated by the thermometer, when placed on the base, at the several stations pointed out by the letters., A mere inspection of the two figures, which have been drawn as lying upon one another, will enable us now to see how very differently the prism disperses the heat-making rays, and those on the terrestral Rays that occasion Heat.. 441 which occasion illumination, over the areas ASQA, and GRQG, of our two spectra ! These rays neither agreein their mean refrangibility, nor in the situation of their maxima. At R, where we have most light, there is but little heat; and at S, where we have most heat, we find no light at all! 21st Experiment. The Sines of Refraction of the beat-making Rays, are in a constant Ratio to the Sines of Incidence. I used a prism with a refracting angle of 6i degrees; and, placing the thermometer No. I half -an inch, and No. i one inch, beyond the last visible red. colour, I kept No. 2 by the side of the spectrum, as a standard for temperature.

I now took a prism with an angle of forty-five degrees, and, placing the thermometers as before, I had as follows: 55 55 55 59 57 54i6i 58 62 58 55 Here we likewise had, in. o minutes, a rise of 7 degrees in the * Dr. 1hR~tL'S Expenen?tSn t he solar, and -therfmometer No. 4, and df A in No. X whie No. t reined stationary. I tried now all the' three angles of a prism of whitish glass: they were of6, 62, and 55 degrees; and I found invisible rays of heat to accompany all the visible spectra given by these angles. I tried a prism of crown glass, having an angle of 3o degrees; and found invisible heat rays as before. I tried a prism of flint glass, with so small an angle as 19 degrees, and again found invisible heat rays. I made a hollow prism, by cementing together three slips of glass of an equal length, but unequal breadth, so as to give me different refracting angles they were of 510,620 3o', and 660 3o'. Then, filling it with water, and receiving the spoctrum, when exposed to the sun, as usual, on the table, I placed the thermometer No. i at ,4 inch behind the visible red colour, and No. A in the. situation of the standard. The refracting angle of the prism was 69,' 3o'; and, in five minutes, the thermometer received 1i degrees of heat from the invisible rays. On trying the other angles, I likewise found invisible heat rays, in their usual situation beyond the red colour. Now, setting aside a minute inquiry into the degrees of heat occasioned by these invisible rays, I shall here only consider them as an additional part, annexed to the different quantities of heat which are found to go along with the visible spectrum; in the same manner as if, in the spectrum of light, another colour had been added beyond the red. Then, as from the foregoing experiments it appears, that a change of the refracting medium, and of the angle by which the refractions were made, occasioned no alteration in the relative -situation of the additional part AG, on the terrestral Rays that occasion Heat. 43 with respect to GQ; and, as. the part GQ is already known to follow the law of.refraction we have mentioned, it is equally evident., that the additional heat of AG must follow the same law. We do not enter into the dispersive power of different mediums with respect to heat, since that would lead us farther than the present state of our iniegtigation could authorise us to go; the following experiment however will shew that, as with light so with heat, such dispersive power must be admitted. 22d Experiment. Correction of the diferent Refrangibility of Heat, by contrary Refraction in dfferent Mediums. I took three prisms; one of crown glass, having an angle of 25 degrees; another of flint glass, with an angle of 24; and a third of crown glass, with an angle of ito degrees. These being put together, as they are placed when experiments of achromatic refractions are to be made, I found that they gave a spectrum nearly without colour. The composition seemed to :be rather a. little over adjusted; there being a very faint tinge of red on the most refracted side, and of violet on the least refracted margin. I examined both extremes by two thermometers; keeping No. 3 as a standard, while No. 2 'was applied for the-. discovery of invisible rays; but I found no heat on either side. After this, I placed No. 2 in the middle of the colourless illumination; and in a little time it rose two degrees, while No. 3 still remained unaltered at some small distance from the spectrum. This quantity was full as much as I could expect, considering the heat that must have been intercepted by three prisms. Thus then it appears, that the different refrangibility of heat, as well as that of light, admits of prismatic correction. And wemay add, that this experiment also tends to the estab44j1 Dr. HERSCHEL'S Experiments on the solar, and lishment of the contents of the preceding one, for the refrangibility of heat rays could not be thus corrected, were the sines of refraction not in a constant ratio to those of incidence. e3d Experiment. in Burning-glasses, the Focus of the Rays of Heat is diferent from the Focus of the Rays of Light. I placed my burning lens, with its aperture reduced to three inches, in order to lessen the aberration arising from the spherica:l figure, in the united rays of the sun; and, being now -apprised of the different refrangibility of the rays of heat, and -knowing also that the least refrangible of them are the most efficacious, I examined the focus of light, by throwing hairpowder, with a puff, into the air. This pointed out the meanfocus of the illuminating rays, situated in that part of the pencil which opticians have shewn to be the smallest space into which they can be collected. That this may be called the focus of light, our experiments, which have proved the maximum of illumination to be situated between the yellow and green, and thereforeamong the mean refrangible rays of light, have fully estabw lished. The mean focus being thus pointed out by the reflection of light on the floating particles of powder, I held a stick of sealing wax il",6, or four beats of my chronometer, in the contracted pencil, half an inch nearer to the lens than the focus. In this time, no impression was made upn the wax. I applied it now half an inch farther from the lens than that focus; and, in 8-tenths of a second, or two beats of the same chronometer, it was considerably scorched. Exposing the sealing wax alsoto the focus of light, the effect was equally strong in the same time; from which we may safely conclude, notwithstanding the little accuracy that can be expected, for want of a more proper on the terrestrial Rays that occasion Heat. 445 apparatus, from so coarse an experiment, that the focus of heat, in this case, was certainly farther removed from the lens than the focus of light, and probably not less than of an inch; the heat, at half an inch beyond the focus of light, being still equal -to: that in the focus. ARTICLE v.Transmission of heat-making Rays. We enter now on the subject of the transmission of heat through diaphanous bodies. Our experiments have hitherto been conducted by the prism, the lens, and the mirror; these mnay indeed be looked upon as our principal tools, and, as such, will stand foremost in all our operations; but the scantiness of this stock cannot allow us to bring our work to perfection. Nor is it merely the want of tools, but rather the natural imperfection of those we have, that hinders our rapid progress. The prism which we use for separating the combined rays of the sun, refracts, reflects, transmits, and scatters them at the same time; and the laws by which it acts, in every one of these operations, ought to be investigated. Even the cause of the most obvious of its effects, the separation of the colours of light, is not well understood; for, in two prisms of different glass, when the angles are such as to give the same mean refraction, the dispersive power is known to differ. Their transmissions have been still less ascertained; and I need not add, that the internal and externalreflexions, and the scattering of rays on every one of the surfaces, are all of such a nature as must throw some obscurity on everyresult of experiments made with prisms. A lens partakes of all the inconveniencies of the prism; to which its. own defects of spherical aberrations must MDCCC. 446 Dr. HERSCHEL'S Experiments on tide solar, and be added. And a mirror, besides its natural incapacity of swpa.. rating the rays of light from the different sorts ofheat, scatters them very profusely But, if we have been scantily provided with materials to act upon rays, it has partly, been, our. own fault: every diaphanous body may become, a new tool, in the hands of a diligent inquirer. My apparatus for transmitting the rays of the sun is of the following constructiona. In a box, 12 inches long, and 8 inches broad, are fix-ed two thermometers. The sides of the box are 24 inches deep. That part of the box where the balls of the thermometers are, is covered by a board, in which are two holes of A inch diameter, one over each of the balls of the therm ometers ; and the bottom, of the box, under. the cover, is cut away, so as to leave these balls freely exposed. There is a partition between the two thermometers, in that part of the box which is covered, to prevent the communication of secondary scatterings of heat. Just under the opening of the transmitting holes, on the outside. of. the cover, is fixed a slip of wood, on which may rest; any glass or other object, of which the transmitting capacity is to be ascertained. A thin wooden cover is provided,t that it may be laid over the transmitting holes, occasionally to exclude the rays of the sun; and, on the middle of the slip of wood, under the. holes, a pin is to, be stuck perpendicularly, that? its shadow -may point outthe situation of the box with respect to the sun. The box, thus prepared, is to be fastened upon two short boards, joined together by a pair of hinges. A long slip of mahogany is screwed to the lowest of these boards, and lies in, the hollow part of -a long spring, fastened against the side of the upper one. The: pressure of the * Se Plate XXI. Fig.I. i See Fig. z-. on the terrestrial Rays that occasion Heat. 447 spring must be sufficiently strong to. keep the boards at any angle; and the slip of mahogany long enough to permit an. elevation of about 85 degrees. In order to see whether all be properly adjusted, expose the apparatus to the sun, and lift up the board which carries the box, till the directing pin throws the shadow of its head on the place where the point is fastened. Then hold a sheet of paper under the box, and, if the thermometers have been properly placed, the shadow of their balls will be in the centre ofthe rays passing through the transmitting holes to the paper. A screen of a considerable size,* with a parallelogrammic opening, should be placed at a good distance, to keep the sun's rays from every part of the apparatus, except that which is under the cover; and no more sun should be admitted into the room, than what will be completely received on the screen, interposed between the window and the apparatus. As one of the thermometers is to indicate a certain quantity of heat coming to it by the direct ray, while the other is to shew how much of it is stopped by the glass laid over the transmitting hole, it becomes of the utmost consequence to have two thermometers of equal sensibility. ' The difficulty of getting ' See Plate XXI. Fig. I. t The theory of the sensibility of thermometers, as far as it depends on the size of the balls, may be considered thus. Let D, d, S, s, T, t be the diameters, the points on which the sun acts, and the points on which the temperature acts, of a large and a small thermometer having spherical balls; and let .x y be the intensity of the action of the sun, to the intensity of the action of the temperature, on equal points of the surface of both thermometers. Then we have s: S d: D , and t: T 4d' + D.I The action of the sun therefore will be expressed by ds x, Dr x; and that of the tem. peratu reby4d y, 4D y; and the united action of both byx-4y x d1, x4y x DI; which are to each other, as d1 D1. Now, the total effect being as the squares of the 3M2 448 Dr. HERSCHEL'S Experiments on the solar, and such is much greater than can be imagined: a perfect equality in the size and thickness of the balls is, however, the most essential circumstance. When two are procured, they should be tried in quick and in slow exposures. These terms may be explained by referring to fire heat; for here the thermometers may be exposed so as to acquire, for instance, 3o degrees of heat in a very short time; which may then be called a quick exposure: or they may be placed so as to make it require a good while to raise them so many degrees; on which account the exposure may be called slow. It is true, that we have it not in our power to render the sun's rays more or less efficacious, and therefore cannot have a quick or slow exposure at our command; but a great difference will be found in the heat of a rising, or of a meridian sun: not to mention a variety of other causes, that influence the transmission of heat through the atmosphere. Now, when thermometers are tried in various exposures, they should traverse their scales together with constant equality; otherwise no dependance can be placed on the results drawn from experiments made with them, in cases where only a few minutes can be allowed for the action of the cause whose influence we are to investigate. The balls must not be blacked; for, as we have already to encounter the transmitting capacity of the glass of which these balls are made, it will not be safe to add to this the transmitting disposition of one or more coats of blacking, which can never diameters, while x : y remain in their incipient ratio, and the contents of the thermo. meters being as the cubes, the sensible effect produced on the particles of mercury, must be as d3 that is, inversely as the diameters. The small thermometer therefore will set off with a sensibility greater than that of the large one, in the same ratio. on, the terrestrial Rays that occasion Heat. 449 be brought to an equality, and are -always liable to change, especially in very quick exposures. Transmission of Solar Heat through colourless Substances. 2,4th Experiment. I laid a piece of clear transparent glass, with a bluish-white cast, upon one of the holes of the transmitting machine: the faces of this glass are parallel, and highly polished. Then, putting the cover over both holes, I placed the machine in the situation where the experiment was to be made, and let it remain there a sufficient time, that the thermometers might assume a settled temperature. For this purpose, an assistant thermometer, which should always remain in the nearest convenient place to the apparatus, will be of use, to point out the time when the experiment may be begun; for this ought not to be done, till the thermometers to be used agree with the standard. In order not to lose time after an experiment, the apparatus may be taken into a cool room., or current of air, till the thermometers it contains are rather lower than the standard; after which, being brought to the required situation, they will soon be fit for action. All these precautions having been taken, I began the experiment by first writing down the degrees of the thermometers; then, opening the cover at the time that a clock or watch shewing.seconds came to a full minute, I continued to write down the state of the thermometers for not less than five minutes. The result was as follows. o Dr. LERSCUEL'S Experiments on the solar) and No. F. No.io Sun.

This shews plainly, that only Ad of the incident heat were transmitted, and therefore that i of it was intercepted by the glass. I shall here, as well as in the following experiments, point .out the difference between heat and light, in order, as has been mentioned before, to lead to an elucidation of our last discuss.. sion. To effect this, therefore, I have ascertained, with all the accuracy the subject will admit of, the quantity of light trans. mitted through such glasses as I have used; but, as it would here interrupt the order of our subject, I have joined, at the end of this Paper, a table, with a short account of the method that has been used in making it, wherein the quantity of light transmitted is set down; and to this table I shall now refer. To render this comparative view more, clear, we may sups pose always 1ooo rays of heat to come from the object: then, 750 being transmitted, it follows, that the bluish-white glass used in our experiment stops 25o of them; and, by the table at on the trestrial Rays that occasion Heat. 451 the end of this Paper, 'it stops 86 rays of light; the number of them coming from the object also being put equal to 1ooo. It should be remarked, that when I compare the interception of solar heat with that of the light of a candle, it must not be understood that I take terrestrial to be the same as solar light; but, not having at present an opportunity of providing a similar table for the latter, I am obliged to use the former, on a suppo-s sition, that the quantity stopped by glasses may not be very different. 2?tb Experiment.

Then, proceeding as before, we have ,gog which shews that 91 rays of heat were stopped. In the table before referred to, we find that this glass stops 34 rays of light. Before I proceed, it will be necessary to adopt a method of reducing the detail of my. experiments into a narrower com452 Dr. HERSCHEL's Experiments on the solar, and pass. It will be sufficientto say, that they have all been made on the same plan as the two which have been given. The observations were always continued for at least five minutes; and, by examining the ratios of the numbers given by the thermometers in all that time, it may be seen that, setting aside little irregularities, there is a greater stoppage at first than towards the end; but, as it would not be safe to take a shorter exposure than five minutes, on account of the small quantity of heat transmitted by some glasses, I have fixed upon that interval as sufficiently accurate for giving a true comparative view. The experiments therefore may now stand abridged as follows. 26th Experiment. I took a piece of highly polished crown glass, of a greenish colour, and, cutting it into several parts, examined the transmitting power of one of them, reserving the other pieces for some other experiments that will be mentioned hereafter.

Transmission of Solar Heat through Liquids. I took a small tube, 12 inch in diameter,* and fixed a stop with a hole 4 inch wide at each end, on which a glass might be fastened, so as to confine liquids. The inner distance, or depth of the liquid, when confined, is three inches. Placing now the empty tube, with its two end glasses fixed, upon the transmitting apparatus, I had as follows: 4th Experiment Sun.

Transmission of solar Heat through scattering Substances. 5oth Experiment. I rubbed one of the pieces of crown glass, mentioned in the a6th experiment, on fine emery laid on a plain brass tool, to make the surface of it rough, which, it is well known, will occasion the transmitted light to be scattered in all directions. Supposing that it would have the same effect on heat, I tried the transmitting capacity of the glass, by exposing it with the rough side towards the sun, over one of the transmitting holes of the apparatus.

My apparatus for the purpose of transmitting flame-,heat is as follows.* A box 22 inches long, 5broad, and i4 deep, has a hole in the centre i-1inch in diameter, through which a wax candle, thick enough entirely to fill it, is to be put at the bottom; the box being properly elevated for the purpose. There must be two lateral holes in the bottom, 2 inches long, and i-L broad;, one on each-side of the candle, to supply it with a current of aUr, as otherwiseit will not give a steady flame, whi'i ch is absolutely necessary. At the distance of 1 I-3 inch from the candle, on each side, are two screens, 12 inches square, with $ See Plate XXIII. Fig x. On the terrestrial Rays tiat QccasionI HTat. a hole in each? 4 inch in diameter, through which the heat of the candle passes to the two thermometerg, which are to be placed in opposite directions, one on each side of the table. Care must be taken to place them exactly atthe same distance from the centre of the flame, as otherwjse they will not receive equal quantities of heat. The scales, and their supports also, must be so kept out of the way of heat coming from the candle, that they may not scatter it back -on the balls. but suffer all that is not intercepted by them to pass freely forwards in the box, and downwards, through openings cut in the bottom. B3efore the transmitting hales , between the two wooden screens, must be two covers of the same material, close to the openings; * andl it will be necessary to join these covers at the side, by a common handle, that they may be removed together, without disturbing any part of the apparatus, when the experiment is to beginr The glasses are to -be put before the therrmometer, close to -the transmnitting hole, by placing them on -a small Aviport below, while the uppe' part is held close to the screen by a light plummet, suspnded by a thread which is fastened on one side, and passes over the glass, to a hook on the other side. In making experiments, many attentions are necessary, such as, keeping the candle exactly to a certain height, that the brightest part of the flame may be just in the centre of the two transmitting holes: that the wick may be always straight, and not, by bending, approach nearer to one thermometer than to the other: that the wax-cup of the candle be kept clean, and never suffered to run over, &c. Before, and now and then between, the observations also, the thermometers must be tried a few degrees, that it may be seen a See Fig. 2t 0 o 464 Dr. HERSCHEL'S experiments on the solar, -and whether they act equally; and the candle, during the time they cool down to the temperature, must be put out by an extinguisher, large enough to rest on the bottom of the box, without touching any part of the wax. Many other precautions I need not mention, as they will soon be discovered by any one who may repeat such experiments. 63d Experiment. Candle.

The apparatus -which I have used for transmitting prismatic rays, is of the same construction as that which has already been described under the. head of direct solar transmissions; * but here the holes in the top of the box are only two inches from each other, and no more than -1ths in diameter.t On the face of the box are drawn two parallel lines, also 3-ths of an inch distant from each other, and inclosing the transmitting holes: they serve as a direction whereby to keep any required colour to fall equally on both holes. The distance at which the box is to be X See Plate XX1. t See Plate XXII. Fig. 3. on the terrestrial Rays that occasion Heat. 471 placed from the prism, must be such as will allow the rays to diverge sufficiently for the re-quired colour to fill the transmitting holes ; and the balls of the thermometers placed under them ought to be less than these holes, that the projected rays may pass around them, and shew their proper adjustment. The diameters of mine, used for this purpose, are 2*L tenths of an inch. 94tb) Experiment. I placed my apparatus at five feet from the prism, and so as to cause the red-making rays to fall between the parallel lines, in order to find what heat-making rays would come to the thermometer along with them.

When the same fire. is to give an equal heat to two thermometers,. at some short distance fromeach other, it becomes highly necessary that there should. be a place; of .considerable dimensions in its centre, where it may burn, with an .eqpal glow, ,and without flame or smoke. To obtain this, I used a grate Ad inches broad, and .8. high, having only three bars, which Zdivide the fire into three large openings. In the centre of the middle one of these, when the grate is well filled with large coals or coke,e may, with proper management, keep up the required equality of radiance. The apparatus I have used is of the following construction.* A screen of wood, S feet 6 inches high, 'and 3 feet broad, lined towards the fire with plates of iron,has two holes, 3 of an inch in diameter, and at the distance of 2j inches from each other, one on each side of' the middle of the screen, and of a height that will answer to the centre of the fire. 2 j inches under the centre of the holes is a shelf, about 22 inches long and 4 broad, on which are placed two thermometers, in opposite directions, fixed on proper stands, to bring the balls, quite disen.gaged from the scales, directly 2 inches behind the transmitting * See Plate XXIV. on the terrestrial Rays that occasion Heat. 477 holes. A small thin wooden partition is run up between the thermometers, to prevent the heat transmitted through one hole from coming to the thermometer belonging to the other. The screen is fixed upon a light frame, which fits exactly into the opening of the front of the marble chimney-piece; and the endsof the frame are of a length which, when the screen is placed before the fire, will just bring the transmitting holes to be 6? inches from the front bars of the grate. A large wooden cover, also plated with iron, shuts up the transmitting holes on the side next to the fire; but may be drawn up by a string on the outside, so as to open them when required. Two assistant thermometers are placed on proper stands, to bring their balls to the same distance from, the screen as those which receive the heat of the fire; but removed sideways as far as necessary, to put them out of the reach of any rays that pass obliquely through the transmitting holes. They are to indicate any change of temperature that may take place during the time of the experiment: for, notwithstanding the largeness of the screen, some heat will find its way round and over it; and this acting as a general cause, its effect must be allowed for. Xl7th Experiment. Having tried the apparatus sufficiently to find that the thermometers exposed to the transmitting holes would, generally receive 2o or more degrees of heat, without differing more than sometimes or at most 4 of a degree, I now placed the bluish. white glass of the 24th experiment upon a support prepared for the purpose, so as closely to cover one of the transmitting holes. A small spring, moveable on its centre, is always turned against MDCCC. 3Q 478 Dr. HE'SCUEL'S Experiments on the solar, and the upper part of the transmitting glasses to keep them, in their situation.

I took now the piece of talc used in the 3oth experiment, and, placing it over the transmitting hole, I had the following result.

I; am -now to point out the singularity of this experiment; which consists, as we may see by the above register of it, in the apparently regular continuance of its power of transmitting heat, while its capacity of transmitting light was totally destroyed. For, when I placed this piece of talc over the hole in the screen, it was extremely transparent, as this substance is generally known to be; and yet, when -the experiment was over, it ape peared of a beautiful white colour; and its power of transmitting light was so totally destroyed, that even the sun in the meridian could not be perceived through it. Now, had the power of transmitting heat through this substance been really uniform during all the five minutes, it would have been quitea new phaenomenon; as all my experiment are attended with ai regular increase 3Q 2 480 Dr. HERSCHEL'S Experiments on the solar, and of it; but since, by calcination, the talc lost much of its transmitting power, we may easily account for this unexpected regularity. 123d Experiment.

This is perhaps the 'most extensive and most interesting of all the articles we have to investigate. Dark heat is with us the most common of all; and its passage from one body into another, is what it highly concerns us to trace out. The slightest change of temperature denotes the motion of invisible heat; and if we could be fully informed about the method of its trans.mission, much light would be thrown on what now still remains a mysterious subject. It must be remembered, that in the following experiments, I only mean to point out the transmission of such -dark heat as I have before proved to consist of rays, without inquiring whether there be any other than such existing. My apparatus for these experiments is as follows. * A box 12 inches long, 52 broad, and , deep, has a partition throughout its whole length, which divides it into two parts. At one end of each division is a hole 3 inch in diameter; and each division contains -a thermometer, with its ball exposed to the hole, and at one inch distance from the outside of the box. Four inches of the box, next to the holes, are covered; the rest is open. In the front of it is a narrowslip of wood, on which may rest any glass to -be tried ; and it is held close to the wood at the top, by a small spring applied against it. Two screws are planted upon the front, one on each side, which may be : See Plate XXV. Fig, I. on the terrestrial Rays that occasion Heat., 4g91 drawn out or screwed in, by way of accurately adjusting the distance of the thermometer from the line of action. In order to procure invisible terrestrial heat, I have tried many different ways, but a stove is the most commodius of them. Iron is a substance that: transmits invisible heat very readily while, at the same time, it will most effectually intercept every visible ray of the fire by which it is heated, provided that be not carried to any great excess. I therefore made use of an iron stove,* having four flat sides and being constructed so as to exclude all appearance of light. I had it placed close to a wall, that the pipe which conveys away smoke might not scatter heat into the room. The thermometer box, when expe'riments are to be made, is to be put into an arrangement of twelve bricks, placed on a stand, with casters: t these bricks, when the stand is rolled close to the stove, which must not be done till an experiment is to begin, form an inclosure, just fitting round the sides, bottom, and covered part of the top of the thermometer box, and completely guard it against the heat of the stove. The box is then shoved into the brick opening close to the iron side of the stove, where the two front screws, coming into contact with the iron plate, give the thermometers their proper distance; which, in the followingexperiments, has been such as to bring the most advanced part of the balls to one inch and four-tenths, from the hot iron. It will be necessary to remark, that on calculating the transmissions for the fifth minute, I found that it would not be doing justice to the stopping power of the glasses, to take solong a time; for, notwithstanding the use of brickwork, and the. * See Plate XXV. Fig. a, f See Fig. 0. 492 Dr. HERSCHEL'S Experiments on the solar, and precaution I had taken, of having two sets of it, that one might be cooling while the other was employed, and though neither of them was ever very hot, yet I found that so much heat; came to the box, that when it was taken out of the bricks, in order to be cooled, the thermometers continued still to rise, at an aver rage, about two degrees higher than they were. I have therefore now taken the third minute, as a much safer way to come at the truth. 170th Experiment. Stove. Bluish-white glass. 0"1 '56 .

We are now come to a branch of our inquiry which, from its novelty, would deserve a fuller investigation than we can at present enter into. The scattering of heat, is a reflection of it on the rough surfaces of bodies; it is therefore a principle of general influence, since all bodies, even the most polished, are sufficiently rough to scatter heat in all directions. In order, therefore, to compare the effect of rough surfaces on heat with their effect on light, I have made a number of experiments, from which the following are selected, for the purpose of our intended comparative view. The apparatus I have used for scattering solar heat, is like that which served, fortransmissions but here the holes through which the sun's rays enter,t are very exactly. il inch in diameter each; and are chamferred away on the under side, * See Plate XXI. Fig. I.. See Plate XXIJ. Fig. 4. 49$8 Vr, UERSCHEIL*S Expiments X tbl so-lar and that no re Iscattering may take place in the thickness of the covering board: the distance of the centre of the holes is 4 inches A little more than an inch below, and under the centre of the holes, are the balls of the small thermometers A and B, well shaded from the direct rays of the sun, by small slips of wood, of the shape of the ball, and of that part of the stem which is exposed. Under each thermometer is a small tablet,* on which the obs jects intended for scattering the sun's rays are to be placed, The tablets are contrived so as to bring the objects perpendui cularlyunder the opeenings, and undierthe centre of the balls of the thermometers) at the distance of exactly one inch from them. Every thing being thus alike on both sides of the box, it is evident, from the equality of the holes, that an equal num, ber of solar rays will fall on each object, and will by them be scattered back on the thermometers at equal angles, and equal distances. The first five experiments that follow, were made with an apparatus somewhat different from the one here described; and, though the result of them may not be so accurate as if they had beenmade with the present one, I must give them as they are since time will not allow of a repetition. i95tb Experiment. Suns Message card scatterings -64 64 5 693 663 Here an object of awhite colour, ,6 inches long, and ,6 broad, scattered, in 5 minutes, 413 rays of heat back upon one * See Plate XXII. Fig. ;. on the terrestrial Rays that occasion Heat. 499 thermometer, while the other received a thousand, directly from the sun. -Now, in order the better to compare the proportion of light and heat scattered by different objects, we shall put these 413 rays equal'to 1ooo; or, which is nearly the same, multiply them by 2,421. Then, since the message card also scatters 100o rays of light, as will be found in a table at the end of the transmission table, our present object may be made a standard for a comparison with the four following ones. 196th Experiment.

Sun. Black paper scattering. 65?L 66 7?81 68 ..4 :2=,41o This paper scatters 993 rays of heat, and 420 of light. From these experiments it seems to be evident, that in scattering heat, the colour of the objectis out of the question ;or, at least, that it is no otherwise concerned than as far as it may influence the texture of the surface of bodies. For here we find that pale-green, which is brighter, or scatters more light, than dark-green, yet scatters less heat. Even black, so generally known to scatter but little light, scatters much heat. But, in order to put this surmise to a fairer trial, I made the; following experiments with my new machine. 200tb Experiment. I covered one of the tablets with white. paper, and the other with black. The quantity of sunshine admitted through the two openings, of 1 2 inch in diameter each, being equal, I found the heat scattered on both thermometers to be as follows. White paper.

As my intention at present was to find a black substance that should scatter more heat than a white one, I thought it would be the readiest way to examine the white and black objects separately, that of all the white ones I might afterwards take that which scattered: least, and compare it with the black one which scattered most.

ART. vI.-Whether Light and Heat be occasioned by the same, or by diferent Rays. Before we enter into a discussion of this question, it appears to me that we are authorised, by the experiments wvhi(!h have been delivered in this Paper, to make certain conclusions, that will entirely alter the form of our inquiry. Thus, from the 18th experiment it appears, that 1 degrees of solar heat were given in one minute to a thermometer, by rays which had' no power of illuminating objects, and which could not be rendered visible, notwithstanding they were brought together in the focus of a bur'ninig lens. The same has also been proved of terrestrial heat, in the 9th experiment; where, in one minute, 3 degrees of it were given to a thermometer, by rays totally invisible, even when condensed by a concave mirror. Hence it is established, on the terrestrial Rays that occasion Heat. 507 by incontrovertible facts, that there are rays of heat, both solar and -terrestrial, not endowed with a power of rendering objects visible. It has also been proved, by the whole tenour of our prismatic experiments, that this invisible heat is continued, from the beginning of the least refrangible rays towards the most refrangible ones, in a series of uninterrupted gradation, from a gentle beginning to a certain maximum; and that it afterwards declines, as uniformly, to a vanishing state. These phenomena have been ascertained by an instrument, which, figuratively speaking, we may call blind, and which, therefore, could give us no information about light; yet, by its faithful report, the thermometer, which is the instrument alluded to, can leave no doubt about the existence of the different degrees of heat in the prismatic spectrum. This consideration, as has been observed, must alter the form of our proposed inquiry; for the question being thus at least partly decided, since it is ascertained that we have rays of heat which give no light, it can only become a subject of inquiry, whether some of these heat-making rays may not have a power of rendering objects visible, superadded to their now already established power of heating bodies. This being the case, it is evident that the onus probandi ought to lie with those who are willing to establish such an hypothesis; for it does not appear that nature is in the habit of using one and the same mechanism xvith any two of our senses; witness the vibrations of air that make sound; the effluvia that occasion smells ; the particles that produce taste; the resistance or repulsive powuers that affect the touch: all these are evadently suited to their respective organs of sense. Are we then So8 Dr. HERSCHEL'S Experiments on the solar, and here, on the contrary, to suppose that the same mechanism should be the cause of such different sensations, as the delicate perceptions of vision, and the very grossest of all affections, which are common to the coarsest parts of our bodies, when exposed to heat ? But, let us see what light may now be obtained from the several articles that have been discussed in this Paper. It has been shewn, that the effect of heat and of illumination may be represented by the two united spectra, which we have given.* Now, when these are compared, it appears that those who would have the rays of heat also to do the office of light, must be obliged to maintain the following arbitrary and revolting positions; namely, that a set of rays conveying heat, should all at once, in a certain part of the spectrum, begin to give a small degree of light; that this newly acquired power of illumination should increase, while the power of heating is on the decline; that when the illuminating principle is come to a maximum, it should, in its turn, also decline very rapidly, and vanish at the same time with the power of heating. How can effects that are so opposite be ascribed to the same cause ? first of all, heat without light; next to this, decreasing heat, but increasing light; then again, decreasing heat and decreasing light. What modification can we suppose to be superadded to the heat-making power, that will produce such inconsistent results ? We must not omit to mention -another difference between light and heat, which may be gathered from' the same article of the refrangibility of heat-making rays. It is, that though light and heat are both refrangible, the ratio of the sines of S See pane 439, and Plate XX. on the terrestrial Rays that occasion Heat. 509 incidence and refraction of the mean rays is not the same in both. Heat is evidently less refrangible than light; whether we take a mean refrangible ray of each, or, which I believe to be the better way of proceeding, whether we take the maximum of heat and light separately. This appears, not only from the view we have taken of the two spectra already mentioned, but more evidently from the 20d experiment, by which we find, that heat cannot be collected by a lens, to the same focus where light is gathered together. Our fifth article, in which an account has been given of the, proportions of heat and light stopped by glasses and other substances, will afford us now an ample field for pointing out a striking difference between these two principles. From the 24th to the 3oth experiment, we have the quantities intercepted by colourless substances as follows. TABLE I. Bluish-white glass stops 250 rays of heat, and 86 of light. White flint glass 91 34 Greenish crown glass 203 Coach glass 214 168 Iceland crystal _ 244 1 150 Talc 139 90 Calcinable talc 184 288 Now, by casting an eye on the above table, it will be seen immediately, that no kind of regularity takes place among the proportions of rays of one sort and of another, which are stopped in their passage. Heat and light seem to be entirely unconnected. The bluish-white and flint glasses, for instance, stop nearly three times as much heat as light; whereas, the MDCCC. of U 510 Dr. HERSCHEL'S Experiments on tbe solar, and greenish crown glass stops only about one-fourth more of the former than of the latter; but, as colo'ured glasses take in a much greater range, I will now also give a tabular result of the experiments that have been given relating to them.

A yellow glass, for instance,' stops only 333 rays of heat, but stops 819 of light: on the contrary, a pale blue stops 812 rays of heat, and but 684 of light. Again, a dark blue glass stops only 362 raysof heat, but intercepts 8oI of light; and a dark red glass stops no more than 6o6 rays of heat, and yet intercepts nearly all the light; scarcely one ray out of hooo being able to make its way through it. Before I proceed to a more critical examination of these results, it will be necessary to add also a table of the same kind, collected from the experiments with liquids. on the terrestrial Rays that occasion Heat.

Now this I think will be obtained, if we can make it appear that stopping one sort of rays does not necessarily bring on a stoppage of the other sort; for, if it can be shewn that heat and light are in this respect independent of each other, it will follow that they must be occasioned by different rays; and I shall make all possible objections to the arguments I mean to draw from these tables, in order to shew that no hypothesis will evade the force of our conclusions. It has been noticed, that bluish-white and flint glasses stop nearly three times as much heat as light; whereas, crown glass stops only about one-fourth more of the former than of the latter. Now, in answer to this, it may be alleged, "I that the "ingredients of which the former glasses are made, dispose them probably to stop the invisible rays of heat, and that "consequently a great interception of it may take place, with"out bringing on a necessity of stopping much light; and that, "on the other hand., the different texture of crown glass may "stop one sort of heat as well as the other, so that nearly an "equality in this respect may be produced." When a hypothesis is made in order to explain any pheenolO menon of nature, we ought to examine how it will agree with other facts ; and, in this case, we are already furnished with experiments, which are decidedly against the supposition that has been brought forward. For, the 148th and i49th experiments shew that the bluish-white and flint glasses transmit all, or nearly all, the invisible rays of solar heat; whereas crown glass, by the i5oth experiment, stops a considerable number of them. But, to assistthe objecting argument, let it be alleged, as has been proved by the 9ath experiment, that our bluish-white glass stops a considerable portion of the heat that goes with the on the terrestrial Rays that occasion Heat, 13 red rays; then, if the 86 rays of light which this glass stops, are supposed to be all of that sort, the heat which will be stopped in consequence, will, according to the experiment we have mentioned, amount to 86 -multiplied by 7 that is, 32 rays of heat; but, since 2-0-have been stopped, there will remain 218 to be accounted for. In this calculation, a manifest concession has been made, which ought to be explained. When I mention 86 red-coloured or red-making rays, I mean so many of them as will make up 8:6-thousandths of the whole effect of light; for the quantity of heat and light transmitted, or stopped, in all the experiments that have been given, has been reduced to what proportion it bears to unity; and, having afterwards represented the joint effect of every ray of heat and light by iooo, each mean ray of heat must be the thousandth part of that effect; but, a. mean ray of light, although it be likewise the thousandth part of the whole effect of light, will not be so of heat, because the -whole effect of the latter is partly owing to rays that have been proved to be invisible. On this account, the 86 mniean rays of red light, stopped by our bluish-white glass, cannot even amount to a stoppage of 32 -rays of heat, which we have allowed. As I have made the concession on one hand, I must explain anadvantage that may be claimed on the other; which is, that mean rays and promiscuous ones have already, in a former Paper, been proved to differ considerably, and that it remains therefore unknown how many red-making rays we 'may suppose to be stopped, in order to make up, 86 mean rays of light. In answer to this, however, I must observe, that the number of -promiscuous rays of light and of heat must always be inversely as their power of occasioning those sensations; so that if, for 514 Dr. HERSCHEL'S Experiments on the solar, and instance, a red ray is supposed to be twice as heating as a green one, there will only go half the number of them to make up a certain effect of heat; and, on the other hand, if a green ray should have a double power of illuminating, there will be no more than half the number of them necessary to' occasion a certain effect of light. But, by my former experiments,* a red ray, though much inferior to a green one, is probably fully equal in illumination to a mean ray of all the colours united together. Now, as red rays have also been proved to be accompanied by the greatest heat, and as our bluish-white glass stops hardly any invisible heat rays, we have certainly gone the full length of fair concessions, by allowing all the light stopped by this glass to be of that sort; and thus it seems to be evident, that the heat which lies under the colours, if I may use this expression, may be stopped, without stopping the colours themselves. It will not be necessary to lay much stress on this single experiment; our second -table affords us sufficient ground on which to rest more forcible arguments. A dark-red glass, for instance., was found to stop 606 rays of heat, and 999,8 of light. This,: even at the very first view, seems to amount to a total separation of the two principles; but let us discuss the phaenomenon with precision. As only one ray in 5ooo can make its way through this glass, it is evident, that if the rays of light be also those of heat, there can hardly come any heat through it but what must be occasioned by rays that are invisible. It will therefore become a question to be examined, how many of this sort we can admit, if we proceed on a supposition that heat consists of light, as far as that will go. Now this, wie find, has already been * See page 27o, moth experiment. on the terrestrial Rays that occasion Heat. ascertained, in a great measure, by our. 13th, i 7th, and 18th experiments. In the igth one hundred and twenty degrees of heat were given to a thermometer, in one minute, by the rays which accompany the coloured part of-the spectrum. In the 17th experiment, on the contrary, we find only 45 degrees of heat communicated to the same thermometer, in the same time, by the invisible rays of the same spectrum. If we would be more scrupulous, the i8th experiment limits the heat from rays totally invisible even to 21 degrees; but, in order to make every possible allowance, let the proportion be the most favourable one of 120 to 45, which, reduced to mean rays of heat, will give 727 of them visible, and 273 invisible, to make up our thousand. To return to the experiment: if the total number of rays of heat ascribed to light should accordingly be rated at 727, it is evident, from the stoppage of light of this glass, that 726 rays of heat at least must also be intercepted; and, in consequence of the 1i3d experiment, which shews that our glass opposes no obstruction to any of the invisible rays, we shall require no more. But, by our present experiment, this glass stops only 606 rays of heat; so that 120 of them will remain unaccounted for. Now, the moment we give up the hypothesis that heat is occasioned by the rays of light, the difficulty becomes fully resolved by our looth experiment, which shews that full three-tenths of the rays that have the refrangibility of the red are actually transmitted. In order, however, to make a second attempt to overcome this difficulty, without giving up the hypothesis, it may be supposed, "that perhaps the lens which has been used in the i3th, 17th, and "i8th experiments might stop a greater number of invisible 516 Dr. HERSCHEL'S Experiments on the solar, and '"than visible rays, ahd that its report therefore ought not to be "depended upon." Now, although it does not appear from the 148th experiment that such a supposition can have much foundation, yet, since those experiments were not made with a view to ascertain the proportion of heat contained in each part of the prismatic spectrum, we cannot lay so much stress upon them as the accuracy which is required in this case renders necessary. Let it therefore, contrary to our looth experiment, be admitted, in order to explain the phamomenon of the red glass, which stops so much light and so little heat, that all the heat which it intercepts consists entirely of the rays which are visible, and that every one of the in-visible rays of heat is transmitted. Then will 999,8 intercepted rays of light be equal to 6o6 rays of heat; and the remaining 94, will be the number of rays we are now to place to the account of the invisible heat which is transmitted. Having thus also got rid of this difficulty, we are next to examine how other facts, collected in the same table, will agree with our new concession. A violet-coloured glass, for instance, stops 955 rays of light; these, at the rate of 999,8, or say 1ooo, to 606, must occasion a deficiency of 579 rays of heat. But, by our table, this glass stops only 489 of them; and there will thus be 9o rays of heat left unaccounted for. To enhance the difficulty, this glass, by our 164th experiment, stops also 4 of the supposed 394 invisible rays, which will amount to an additional sum of 98. And our 1Mth experiment shews, that actually a great number of these rays, that otherwise cannot be accounted for, come from the store of heat, the rays of which 'are of the refrangibility of red light. A dark-blue glass stops 801 rays of light; these, if light and on the terrestrial flays that occasion Heat. x7; heat were occasioned by the same rays, would produce a stop. page of 485 rays of heat; but we find that our glass stops no more than 62,, so that i rays cannot be accounted for by this hypothesis. To this we should add 66 invisible rays, (that is, 39 x ,i67,) which, according to our i6oth experiment, this glass also intercepts. But the 107th experiment, if we reject the hypothesis, -immediately explains the difficulty; for here we plainly see, that only 71 rays of heat of the refrangibility of red light are stopped, whatever may be the stoppage of that light itself. A yellow glass stops 81 rays of light: these will occasion a stoppage of 496 rays of heat; but this glass intercepts only 333, and therefore 163 rays of heat must also remain unaccounted for. And, turning to the 155th experiment, we find that 79 rays, or j of the 394 allowed to be invisible ones, are also to be added to that number. If in the results of our second table we have had an excess of heat, which the last hypothesis would not account for, we shall, on the contrary, meet. with a considerable deficiency, when we come to consider those of the third table, For instance, our tube filled with well-water, including the glasses at the end, intercepted 1 1 rays of light. These, at the rate of 6oG to the thousand, would produce only a stoppage of 12S rays of heat; but here we find no less than 558 of them intercepted. To evade the pressure of these consequences, it may be said," that as before every invisible ray was supposed to "have been transmitted through glasses, so they may now be all "intercepted by liquids." And, granting this also to be possible though by no means probable, for the great extent of these researches has not allowed sufficient time for many experiments MDCCC. 3 X S18 Dr. HERSCHEL'S xperiments on the solar, and to be made that have been planned for execution.; yet, even then', 128 visible and 394 invisible rays to be intercepted, will only make up -2 ; so that a deficiency of 36 must still remain. In se-a-water, the balance will stand thus: 288 rays of light give 175 rays of heat; these and 394 invisible rays maie up G9S buat the rays actually intercepted were 682, which argues a deficiency of no less than i ij rays. 'But if 1 have for a noment admitted the entire; stoppage of the-invisible rays of heat in liquids, the same indulgence cannot be granted for the empty tube, as we know it does neither take place in glasses, nor in air. Therefoic we. must calculate thus: this compound of glass and air stops 2o4 rays of light; these can amount only to 12 rays of heat-; but it is found to stop 542 of them, so that 418 remain to be accounted for. Now, we certainly can not suppose more than ioo of them to owe their deficiency to the store of invisible heat; so that 318 will still remain unaccounted for. : And thus, from the second table, wAe have given instances where the assumed hypothesis of visible and invisible heat, inr certain proportions, would require a greater stoppage than our experiments will admit ; and now, on the contrary, it appears, that interceptions calculated according to the same hypothesis, should be. less than the results in the third table give them. From' which we conclude, that every other proportion fixed, upon, would always be erronreous, either in excess or in defect. Equal contradictions may be shewn to attendall endeavours to account for the results contained in our fourth table, by admitting any visible heat at all, let the quantity be what -it will. To lmake the proof of this general, let ioooo be the total heat, and assume x for that part of-it which. we would suppose to be on the terrestrial Rays tha't occasion Heat. r9 occasioned by visible rays; then will looo x be the remainder, which must be ascribed to rays that cannot be seen. Now, by our table, we find that crown glass, of which one side has been rubbed on emery, stops 854 rays of light. These alone, if not a particle of invisible heat were stopped, would be equal to ,854 X visible rays of heat, that must be intercepted by the glass. When the other side of this glass has also been rubbed on emery, it will stop 932 rays of light, which will give ,932 x, for the quantity of heat to be intercepted, on the same supposition, that all invisible rays of heat are transmitted. But, by our fourth table, we have the actual stoppage of heat of these glasses; which will therefore give us the two following equations; ,854 X 464, and ,932 x = 667. Then, taking the first from the last, and reducing the remaining equation, we obtain x = 3 for the P07 8 visible part of the total heat. But 203, or 2602, being only a ,078' part, comes out greater than looo, which is the whole; and this being absurd, it follows that visible rays of heat cannot be admitted, in any proportion whatsoever. This will equally hold grood with any additional stoppage of invisible heat, provided it be equal in both glasses; and, of this equality, the 165th and 167th experiments can leave us no room to doubt. But it is high time that we should now take into consideration a more direct proof, which -may be drawn from our prismatic experiments. The results of them are here brought into a table, as follows. 3XX Dr. LRtscHExL's Experiments on the solar, and TABLLE V.

But it has also been proved, that heat of the same variety in refrangibility as the different colours, is likewise contained in every part of the coloured spectrum. The question which we are discussing at present, may therefore at once be reon the terrestrial Rays that occasion Heat. 52t ,duced to this-single point. Is the heat which-has the refrangibility of the red rays occasioned by the light of these rays? For, should that be the case, as there will then be only one set of rays, one fate only can attend them, in being either transmitted or stopped, according to the power of the glass applied to them. We are now to appeal to our prismatic experiment -upon the subject, which is to decide the question. First, with regard to. light, I must anticipate a series of highly interesting observations I have made, but which, though they certainly claim, cannot find room ,in this' Paper. These have given me the means of acting separately upon either of the extremes, or on the middle of the prismatic spectrum; and by them I am assured that red glass does not stop red rays. Indeed the appearance of objects seen through such coloured glasses, till I can give those observations, will be a sufficient proof to every one that they transmit red light in abundance. Next, with regard to the rays of heat, the case is just the reverse; for, by our preceding table, the red glass stops no less than 692, out of a thousand, of such rays as are of the refrangibility of red light. The incipient stoppage, moreover, or that in two minutes, of which something. will be said hereafter, amounts even to 75o rays. Now, if it should be suspected, " that on account of the great "breadth of prism, some invisible heat may be thrown upon the spot where the red colour falls," I do not only agree to it, but am certain it cannot be otherwise: but this again, will give additional weight to our present argument-; for, by the 153d experiment, as our last table shews, it has already been ascertained, that all such heat will be transmitted through a red glass; so that, were it not for some of this admixture, the stoppage might be still greater. '522 Dr. HERSCHEL'S xperime ts.Qon the iolar and Here then we have a, direct and simple proof, in the case of the red glass, that the rays of light are transmitted, while those of heat are stopped, and that thus they have nothing in common but a certain equal degree of refrangibility, which, by the power of the glass, must occasion them tobe thrown together into the place which is pointed out to us by the visibility of the rays of light. The manifest use of the union of these rays, arising from their equal refrangibility, will be explained at a future opportuunity, when I may perhaps lthrow out several hints-that have already o-ccurred to me, where the contents of this Paper may be applied to the useful purposes of life. There still remains a general argument, -that heat and light are occasioned by different rays, which ought not to be omitted. This, on account of the contracted state in which the experiments have been given, cannot appear from my Paper; but, by an inspection of them at full length, it is proved, that the stoppage of solar heat, setting aside little irregularities, to which all observations are liable, has constantly been greater in the first, second, or third minute, than in the fourth or fifth.; or, more accurately, nearer the beginning of the five minutes, than about the end of them. Now thi's does not happen in the transmission of light, which, as far as we know, is instantaneous; at least a failure in the brightness of an object, when first we look at it through a glass, amounting to one, two, or even three minute could not possibly have escaped our observation. This seems to suggest to us, that the law by which heat is transmitted, is different from that which directs the passage of light; and, ,in that-case, it must become an irrefragable argument of the difference of the rays which occasion them. on the terrestrial Rays that occasion Heat. 523 The surmise of a difference in the law of the transmission of heat and of light, is considerably supported by an argument drawn from circumstances of a very different nature. In the scattered transmissions arising from rough surfaces, we find, that when crown glass, for instance, has one of its sides rubbed on emery, it will stop 205 rays of heat more than while that surface remained polished; but the effect of the roughness produced by emery scratches, is-far more considerable on the rays of light; the additional stoppage of them amounting to no less than 65i. A confirmation of the same effect we have in coach glass; which, having also one side rubbed on emery, stops only t7 rays of heat -more than it did before, while there is an additional stoppage of rays of liglht, amounting to no less than 71 7. Now, since the interior construction of these glasses, before and after having been rubbed on emery, remains the same, these remarkable effects can only be ascribed to the roughness of -their surfaces. Hence, we may conclude, that as the same cause, when it acts upon the rays of heat and light, produces effects so very different, it can only be accounted for by admitting the rays themselves to be of a diffirent nature, and therefore subject to a different law in being scattered. It has already been shewn, that the rays of heat are, upon an average, less refrangible than those of light; and now it appears that they are also, if I may introduce a convenient term, less scatterable. We ought now also to take a short review of the phenomena attending the transmission~of terrestrial heat. The results of the experiments which have been given, are drawn into one view in the following table. S24 Dr. HERSCHEL'S Experiments on the solar, and TABLE VI. Rays of flame. Fire.

The first that must occur is, that a candle which emits light is also a copious source of invisible heat. If this should seem to require a proof, I give it as follows. That the candle emits heat along with light, the thermometer has ascertained; and, that a considerable share of this at least must be invisible, follows from comparing-together the quantity of light and heat which are stopped by different glasses.The bluish-white one, for instance, stops 86 rays of light, and 625 of heat. Hence, if only visible rays of heat came from the candle, a glass stopping more light, as for instance the dark-red glass, which stops 999,8, ought to stop all heat whatsoever; but the fact is, that it even stops one hundred rays less than the former. This instance alone shews plainly, that the existence of invisible terrestrial heat in the flame of a candle, is proved; while, on the contrary, heat derived from rays that are visible, remains yet to be established, by those who would maintain that there are any such. But, for the sake of argument, let us endeavour to explain how visible rays of heat may be reconciled with the contents of our 6th table. "Now although we must allow," it may be said, " that there "is a -certain quantity of candle-heat which cannot be seen, we "are however at liberty to assign any ratio that this may bear to its visible heat-rays. Let us therefore begin with the bluish"white glass, and make the most favourable supposition we can, "in order to explain its phaenomena. Visible or invisible, it stops "62,5 rays -of heat, and also 86 of light.. Now, as in the last "column of the table we have likewise the proportional quantity "of invisible heat it intercepts, which is 700 out of a thousand, MDCCC. 3 Y 526 D)r. HEascnEL' Experiments othe solar, and "' we meay surmise -that the 914 rays of lights together with the "300 of the invisible rays which are transmitted, make up the 375 "rays of heat which pass through the glass. Hence, by algebra, we have the number of invisible heat-rays 878, and the number " of the visible ones 122. Then, to try how this will answer, if "1000 rays of light give 122 of heat, 86 will give lo; and, if out of a thousand invisible rays 700 be stopped, 878 will give "615 to be intercepted. The sum of these will be 6295, which is "exactly the number pointed out by our table." Now this being a fair solution of one instance, let us see how it will agree with some others. Before I proceed, however, I cannot help remarking, that the supporters of visible heat-rays must feel themselves already considerably confined, as our present argument will not allow them more than 122 of such rays out of a thousand. Now, if the assumption that terrestrial heat is owing to a mixture of visible and invisible rays, in 'the proportion of 122 of the former to 878 of the latter, be well founded, it ought to explain every other phaenomenon collected in our table. The purple.caloured glass stops 993 rays of light, which, according to our present hypothesis, should stop 12i rays of heat: it also stops 730 invisible rays, which will give 641 rays of intercepted heat; therefore this glass should stop 762 rays of heat, out of every thousand that come from a candle; but, from our table, we find that it stops no more than 52o, so that 242 rays cannot be accounted for. The glass with an olive colour burnt into it, stops 984 rays of light, or 120 of heat, and 637 invisible rays, or 559 of heat. The sum is 679 which that glass should stop; but it stops actually 792; so that, as in the foregoing instance we had a defion the terrestrial Rays that occasion Heat. 527 ciency of 242 rays, we now have an excess of 1 1i,; which plainly shews, that no hypothesis of any other proportion between the visible and invisible rays of heat can answer to both 'ases; and that consequently, not only the present, but every other assumption of this kind, must be given up as erroneous. I shall not enlarge on these arguments, as I take them to be sufficiently clear to decide the question we have had under con-sideration. I also forbear going into an examination of what our sixth article, which treats of scattered heat, might afford, in addition to the former arguments. It may just be remarked, that the 211th experimentpoints out a black object, which scatters more heat than a white one ; while the case, as to light, is well known to be -the reverse. The 2igth experiment also shews, that the scattering of heat of gold paper is considerably inferior to that of black velvet; whereas a contrary difference, of a very great extent, is pointed out between these two substances, for black velvet scatters only 7 rays of light, while the scattering of gold paper amou-nts to more than 124000. I am well aware that this difference will perhaps admit of a solutionon other principles than those which relate merely to the laws of scattering, and confess that many experiments are still wanting to complete this article, which cannot now be given; but, as this Paper is already of an unusual length, I ought rather to apologize for having given so much, than for not giving more. 2Y 5q8 Dr. HERSCHEL'S Experiments on the solar, and Table of the transmission of terrestrial scattered Light througig various Substances; with a short Account of the Method by which the Results contained in this Table have been obtained. The transmissions here delivered are called terrestrial and scattered, to distinguish them from others, which are direct and solar; and, in the use I have made of them in the foregoing Paper, it -has been supposed that light-making; rays, whether direct and solar, or scattered and terrestrial, are transmitted in the same manner; or that the difference, if there be any, may not be considerable enough to affect my arguments materially. In-this I have only followed the example of an eminent optical writer, who does not so much as hint at a possibility that there may be a diffierence. Before I describe my apparatus, I ought to mention that it is intirely founded on the principles of the author now alluded to,* and that 'no other difficulty occurs in the execution of his plan, than; how to guard properly against the scatterings of the lamp for the light which this will throw on every object, must not be permitted to come to the vanes; since these scatterings cannot remain equal on both vanes, when one of them is moveable. In the following construction, the greatest difficulties have been removed; and a desirable consistency in the results of the experiments, when often repeated, hasl now been obtained. A board about fourteen feet long, and six inches broadt has two slips of deal, an inch square, fastened upon the two sides: these make a groove, for two short pieces to slide in, backwards and forwards. The two sliding pieces . carry each a small* See Traite d'Optique, page 16, Fig. 5; Ouvragepostbume de M. BOUGUER. t See Plate XXVI. Fig. i. I See Fig. 2 and 3. on thie terrestrial fays that occasion Heat. 9 board or vane; one towards the right, the other towards the left; but so as to meet in the middle,_ and apparently to make .but one when placed side by -side. The vanes are covered with a piece of fair white paper, which is to reflect, or rather to scatter light in every direction. To one end of the board is fixed a circular piece of wood, with an opening in it, which is afterwards to be shut up by a small moveable piece,* intended for placing: the transmitting objects upon. This moveable piece contains two holes, at the distance of 11 inch from centre to centre, 'and + inch in diameter each. Against the circular wooden screen, and close over the opening in it, is placed a lantern containing a lamp.t Its construction is such as to admit a current-of air to feed the flame from below, by means of a false bottom, and to let it out by a coveredroof; and the whole of the light, by the usual contrivance of dark lanterns, is thus kept within, so as to leave the room in perfect darkness, In the front, that is towards the vanes the lantern has a sliding door of tin-plate, in which there is a parallelogram mic hole, covered with a spout five inches long, of the same shape. Two or three such doors, with different spouts and openings; will be required to be put in, according to the experiments to be made; but the first will do for most of them. A narrow arm is fastened to the long board, which advances about three feet beyond the screen, and carries a circular piece of pasteboard, that has an adjustable hole in the centre, through which the observer is to look when the experments are tQ be made., At the farther end of the long board is a pulley; over which a string, fastened to the back of the slider that carries one of the, vanes, is made to pass. This string returns under the * See Plate XXVI. Fig. {. t See Fig. S. Sjo Dr. HERSCHEL'S Experiments on the solar, and bottom of the long board, towards the other end, where, close to the observer, another pulley is fixed; and, after going also -over this pulley, it returns at the top of the board, to the front of the same vane, to which the other end of it is fastened at the back. By pulling the string either way, the observer may bring forward the moveable vane, or draw it back, at pleasure. At the side of the long board is a scale of tens of inches mbered -from the place of the flame of the lamp, o, Io, 20o, 30, 40, and so on to i 60. A pair of compasses being applied from the last ten towards the vane, ascertains its distance from the flame, to as great an accuracy as may be required, When the transmitting power of a glass is to be tried, it must be placed over one of the holes of the small moveable piece, which then is fastened with a button, upon the opening left for it in the circular wooden screen. Then, looking through the hole of the pasteboard at the two vanes, and bringing that which is seen through the: glass near enough to give an image equally bright with that which is seen through the open hole, the observation will be completed. Having measured the odd inchesby a pair of compasses or immediately by a scale, we deduce, as usual, the transmitting power, by taking double the logarithm of the distance of the farthest vane from the: lamp, froin double the logarithm of the distance of the nearest vane. The remaining logarithm is that of the transmitting power, as compared to the light coming ,directly to the eye from the other vane. I have now only to remark, that the use of this instrument requires some practice, especially when coloured glasses are to be examined; it will, however, be found, that the difference of the colour of the two objects, when their light isl brought to an equality, may be overcome by a little abstraction, which is t-he trestrial Rays that occasion 1reat. required for the purpose; for, by attending only to brightness, it has often happened to me, that both objects appeared at last of the same colour; which proved 'to be some mean between the two appearances considered separately. Some glasses stop so much light, that it will be advisable to take them by the assistance of an intermediate one. Thus, instead of comparing-the open vane directly to a red glass, I settle first the ratio of the violet one to that vane; then., taking the ratio of the red to the violet, and compounding these two ratios, the result will be more accurate. The reason for this will be easily comprehended, when the construction of the appal ratus is considered. For a red glass, immediately compared to. the open vane, would require its object to be brought extremely; near the lamp, while the other must remain at a very great distance. This would occasion a considerable difference in the angles, both of incidence and of reflection, between the rays falling on one vane, and on the other. But, by dividing the observation into two operations, we avoid the errors that might be occasioned by the former arrangement. In the following table, the first column contains the names of the different substances throughwhich light has been transmitted. The second column shews the transmission of light, expressed in decimal fractions; or the proportion which it bears to the whole incident light considered as unity. An arithmretical complement to this fraction, or what it wants to unity, will therefore give us the proportion of light which is stopped by each of the substances contained in the first column; and that quantity multiplied by mooo is placed in the third column. 53e, IDr. HERSCHEL'S Experiments on the solar, and TABLE VII.

The same apparatus which has been used to gainQ the results of the preceding table, has also been employed for the following one, with no other difference than that while the vane with the white paper remained on one side, the other vane was successively covered by the objects whose power of scattering light was to be ascertained, and both vanes were viewed directly through the two open holes in the screen; the eye being stationed in the same place as before. MDCCC. 3 Z 5S44 Dr. HtRSCHEL'S Experiments on the solar, and It will be found, that this table contains the scattering of more objects than have been referred to in the preceding paper; but, as I made these experiments in a certain order, I thought it would be acceptable to give the table at full length. The first column gives the names of the objects; and the second contains the number of rays of light scattered by them, when compared to a standard of white paper, which is supposed to scatter one thousand.

EXPLANATION OF THE PLATES. Plate XX, represents the spectrum of heat A, S, Q, A; and of light GI R, Q, G. If a prism be placed in a window, so as to throw the colours of light upon a table, and Plate XX be laid under the colours, so that they may respectively fall upon the places where their names are inserted, then may these colours be made to fit into their proper spaces, by lowering or raising the prism, at pleasure. When the colours occupy their proper situations, the line A Q will express the space over 3 Z 2 DKH-Dr. IEISC:HEL's Experiments on the solfar, and which the prism, by their different refrangibility, scatters the -rays of heat; and the ordinates to A Q will nearly express the proportional elevations, which a set of equi-changeable thermometers would experience, when placed in the different situations of these ordinates. Plate XXI. Fig. 1. A, B, is the box which holds the two thermometers, No. i and NTo. a.C is the board which contains the transmitting holes, the slip of wood for supporting the glasses, and the perpendicular pin for adjusting the angle. D, E, are the boards joined together by hinges. F is a slip of mahogany screwed to E. G is the spring to confine the slip F; which will keep the board D up to any angle less than 90 degrees. Fig. 2, is the cover for shutting the transmitting holes. Plate XXII. 'Fig. 1, is the screen, which may be elevated, by the usual contrivance of springs at the back, to any required height, so as to permit the rays of the sun to pass through the opening in the middle, and to fall upon the transmitting holes of the box A, B, in Plate XXI. Fig. 2, is a second upper part of the box A, B, in Plate XXI. 'The first upper part being screwed off, this is to be put on instead of it, when experiments with liquids are to be made. It contains, as before, the two transmitting holes, the slip of wood, and the pin; and it has moreover a small bracket fastened under one of the holes, on which the: tube containing the liquid to be tried may be laid. Fig. 3, is a third upper part to the box A, B, of Plate XXI. It contains two small holes, for transmitting prismatic rays to -the two thermometers A and B, which must now be put into the box, instead of No. 1 and No. ,. The parallel lines a, b, inclosw on the terrestrial Rays that occasion Heat. 537 ing the holes, will direct any coloured rays to the thermometers; and by drawing the red rays down to :the lower parallels c or d?. invisible rays may be brought to'enter the transmitting holes. Fig. 4, is a fourth upper part to the box A, B, Plate XXI. It contains two large holes, for admitting the rays of the sun to fall upon the objects on Fig. 5. Fig. a, represents two tablets, ab, united; they may be covered with any objects that are to be examined; for instance, a with white paper, and b with black velvet. These tablets, by a pro-. per contrivance, are brought under the holes of figure 4, where a button fastens them at the required distance. Plate XXIII. Fig. i. A, B, is the box which holds the thermometers. C, D, are the screens, with the transmitting holes in them, opposite the flame of E, the candle. F, is a small weight, stretching a string across the glass, or other object, placed upright against the transmitting hole of the screen D. It may be carried round the screen C, if required, and hold a glass against the hole in it. Fig. 2, is the double cover: in putting it on, it must be passed over the candle downwards, against the two-transmitting holes. Plate XXIV, represents a large screen, with the shelf A, B, carrying four thermometers, No. i and No 5 opposite the transmitting holes, and the other two as represented. When the fire is properly prepared, lift the screen, by taking hold a little above A and B, and set it close to the fire, so that C, D, may touch the bottom of the grate; then take hold of the ring E, and pull the string far enough. out to hang that ring on the hook F: this will open the transmission holes, when the experiment is to begin. Plate XXV. Fig. i, is the box containing the thermometers. 538 Dr. *HRSCHEL'S dExperiments on the solar, and The bricks are piled up, as represented in Fig. 3. The stove, Fig. 2, being prepared, bring the stand, and brick.-work, Fig. 3, close to it; and set also the two spare bricks, which lie on the stand, upon the front of the stove, that no heat may pass from the top of it to the brick inclosure; then put the box, Fig. i, into the brick-work, close up to the stove, and begin the experiment. The ash-hole should also be covered with a brick. Plate XXVI. Fig. i, represents the Photometer. The hole at A, is for the observer to look through, that he may have a fixed station. the vanes F and G are moveable. By pulling the string at H, G will be brought nearer the lamp placed at K; and, by drawing the same string at I, it will be removed towards the vane F; which latter may be fixed at any distance most convenient for the experiment. Fig. 2 and 3, shew the mechanism of the adjustable vane 2, and moveable one 3. There are, however, hooks on fig. 2, which will occasionally receive the strings from the hooks on fig. 3, when a motion of the left vane, instead of the right, is required. Fig. 4, contain's two limiting holes B, C; over one of which, C, a glass may be laid. This piece is to be buttoned on the rabbet of the screen, at D E, fig. 1. When liquids are to be tnied, the second piece of fig. 4, which contains a bracket for supporting the transmitting tube, is to be fastened on D E, fig. i, instead of the former plate. Fig. A, gives a view of the lamp. and its sliding door, with the spout L, which, when the lamp is placed at K, fig. i, conveys the light to the vanes F and G, without permitting it to be scattered on the long board.
