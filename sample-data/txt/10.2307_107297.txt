g 49 XVII. On the Changesproduced in Atmospheric Air, and Oxygen Gas, by Respiration. By' W.Allen, Esq. F. R. S. and W11. Pepys, Esq. F. R. S. Read June i6th, i808. i HE process of respiration, or breathing, is so intimately connected with our existence in life, that from its first moments, to the final close, sleeping and waking, this necessary action is constantly maintained: nor can it be suspended even for a few minutes without considerable pain and the utmost danger. This important process has of course excited the curiosity both of ancient and modern philosophers; amnong the latter we find the distinguished names of MAYOW, PRIESTLEY, GOODWIN, MENZIES, SPALLANZANISCHEELE, LAVOISIER and DAVY, whose successive labours have thrown great light upon this difficult subject, and prepared the way for farther investigation ; but it is impossible to take a review of what has already been done, without perceiving that some important points were by no means satisfactorily settled ; an accurate method of separatinc the different gasses, and ascertaininr their exact proportion in any given mixture, was still a desideratum when many of the experiments were made, and it is only of late years that Eudiometry has attained its present perfection: the quantity of residLuPl gas in the lungs after a forced expiration was a matter in dispute amnong former experielnters, some making it one hundred cand nine cubic inches, and others only forty MjJDCCCVIII. K k o56 AMessrs. ALLEN an-d--PEPYs on the Changes produced ib and yet it is of the utmost consequence in all calculations upon the effects produced, especially upon small portions of gas, that the state of the lungs should be accurately determnined; this constitutes the great difficulty in the investigations. We therefore commenced our labours by constructing an apparatus, in which we are able to respire from three to four thousand cubic inches of gas, conceiving, that in this quantity, the error arising from the residual gas in the lungs must be so much obviated as to permit the most satisfactory results. The apparatus consists of three gasomen.ters, two of which are filled with mercury, and one with distilled water. The water gasometer which belongs to the Royal Institution, is capable of holding four thousand two hundred cubic inches of gas, and each of the mercurial ones three hundred cubic inches: the apparatus was so arranged that the inspirations were all made from the water gasometer, and the expirations into the mercurial gasometers alternately. Each of the gasometers is furnished with a graduated scale, and they are all made to range with each other, so that the quantity of gas inspired and expired could be immediately and exactly ascertained: to each of the mercurial gasometers a glass tube is fixed, and made to enter a mercurial bath, from which portions of the expired air could at any time be taken for examination. By the kindness of our friend SILVANUS BEVAN, we are enabled to give an accurate drawinrg of the apparatus. GI~~~~~~~~~/t (try ~14%)ul . .

The large :-reservoir or water gasometer is not shewn in this drawing, it having been so frequently described in chemical works. Manner oif conducting the Experiment. Our first care was, to be certain that all the parts of our apparatus were perfectly air-tight, and this, from the nature of it, was: very easily ascertained; we agreed that the breathe. inger should always be performed by one of us, and the registering,; &c. by the other, as each would by that means acquire a greater degree of dexterity in performing his part, and the results wvould be more uniform. The water gasometer being filled with common air to a certain mark upon the scale, and the mercurial ones completely empty, the person to breathe, whom we shall uni-t forrnly call the operator, was seated upon a stool, with his mnouth even wvith the tube A,, his nose being secured with a stcel -clip lie made as complete an expiration as possible K k 2 Messrs. ALLEN and PEPYs on the Changes produced in .nlto the open air, then applying his lips to the tube, and lkeeping his left hand constantly on the cock, fig. i, and his right hand on the cock, fig. , he opened the communication with the water gasometer, and made an inspiration then immediately closing it, he opened with lhis right hand the cock at 2 ; and that at 4 being also opened, he expired into the mercurial gasometer G. 1.; then closing 2, which cut off all communication with the mercurial gasometer, he opened 1, inl order to make a fresh inispiration; then ciosing it, he again op ened 2, and expired into the merc urial gasometer; and proceeding in this way, always taking care to shUt one cock before the other was opened, the air was made to pass fromn the -water gasometer, through the lungs of the operator into the mercurial gasometer, and this w7ith great ease, as the diameters of the tubes were purposely made large. T he scale of the mercurial gasometer was carefully noticed, and when nearly full, the cock 4 underneath was shut off: then, by a signal fromn the operator, his colleague opened 3, and the expirations vere received in G. 2. While this was filling, the number of cubic inches in G. i was registered, a portion saved in the mercurial bath, and the rest quickly expelled. This operation was repeated until the contents of about twelve or thirteen mercurial gasomet ers were taken off; the operator always concluding with a strong effort to enipty his lungs as completely as possible. The quantity inspired from the water gasometer was then compared with the quantities expired into the mercurial gasometers, and the diff~erence noted. The following are the results of the first ten experiments. Atmospheric Air and Oxygen Gas by Respiration. a Cubic inches Cubic Inches Deiec. No. WTimle. of commoinair -of Gas Inspired.

The breathing i n these cases was as nearly natural as we conceive it possible to be in any apparatus; the operator wasl scarcely fatigued, and his pulse not raised more than about one beat in a minute; the respirations however were deeper and fewer than natural, amounting only to about 58 in eleven minutes, wvhereas from repeated observations at different and distant times he makes 19 in a minute. The smallness of the deficienlcy surprised us very much, as, from the reports of other experimenters we had been prepared to expect a muLIch greater loss. It might be objected that the air was rarefied by passing through the lungs but this was almost immediately counteracted by the mnass of quicksilver in the gasometers, which amounted at least to one hundred and fifty pounds ; and we hlave repeatedly noticed, that air under these circumstances has suffered no perceptible diminution by standing for a considerable time; in one case, in which air from ed54 Messrs. ALtEN and PEPYS on the cfhanges produced in the lungs was driven into the mercurial gasometers for twventy-seven minutes, the temperature of the quicksilver at the end of the experiment was not raised half a degree of FAHRENuJETT'S thermiometer. The deficiency, in our opinion, principally arises fromn. the difficulty in bringing the lungs precisely to the same state after, as before the experiment;> and it must be recollected that the operator commenced by a forcible expiration into the open air, but finished by a folrciblc expiration into the mercurial gasometer. Now, -although this gasometer was counterpoised by weights in the scale attached to it, yet we can easily conceive that more resistance might be afforded to the complete evacuation in the latter case than in the former, and consequently the lungs might contain a few inches more after the experiment than before it, which might in some measure account for the deficiency. In the eleventh experiment, portions of gas were taken off from each of the mercurial gasometers as they were filled, and these portions being afterwards mixed were carefully examined, Eleventh Experiment.

Eprd 30,4 50 I I mill. 3460 3437 23 To prevent repetition, we shall here state that all the trials were made inl the same manner, and with the same apparatus, namely, the Eudiometer, described in the Society's Transactions for 1807, in which one cubic inch is divided into one hundred parts ; and that in almost every instance we made two, and sometimes three experiments on the same gas, and Atm~ospheric Air and Oxygen0 Gs aby Resiration. , derived fresh confidence.from the remarkable coincidence and uniformity of the results. No precaution was at any time omitted which appeared to us necessary to insure accuracy. One hundred parts of the expired gas being agitated with lime water in the eudiometer, the line water became turbid, and 8.5 parts of the gas were absorbed which were consequently carbonic -acid; the remaining 91.5 parts were treated with the green sulphate of iron, saturated with nitrous gas, as recommended by Professor DAVY, and afterwards vith the simple solution of the green sulphate, when 1i., parts:rWere absorbed, which were consequently oxygen, and the remainiig 7r azote. ioo parts of the expired gas therefore consisted of 8.5 carbonic acid. .5 oxygen. 79-. azote.

So that 292.14 cubic inches of carbonic acid gas were given off in eleven minutes, or 26.55 cubic inches per minute, which 1s almost exactly the estimate of Professor DAVY. In this experiment the operator inspired 346o cubic inches in eleven minutes, and felt himself in a natural state when he left off. Then, as he makes usually under common circums stances nineteen respirations in a minute, 3460 li X 19 209 09 _ 16. it follows, that he takes in i6cubic inches at every easy in-l spiration. As all the experiments had been hitherto made upon the lungs of one person, we concluded that the next should be performed upon our assistant. Twelfth Experiment. Cub. inches ofui nhs ifrne Therm.

The excess of eleven cubic inches in this case, no doubt arose from the person not having been in the habit of exhausting his lungs, so that they contained more when he began than when he left off; his lungs appeared to be of greater capacity than those of the usual operator. Portions of gas were saved from each of the mercurial Atmospherzc Air and Oxygen Gas by Respiration. , gasometers as they were filled, which beling mixed together, for the average gave the following results: ioo parts of the mixture contained 8 5 carbonic acid 12.5 oxygen. 79 azote. 100 Calculation for Carbonic Acid. 100 : 8.5 3311: 281.43. Consequently 281,43 cubic inches of carbonic acid gas were given off in 51 minutes. In this experiment we meet with a remarkable fact, viz. that as much carbonic acid gas was given off in 5minutes, as in the former experiment in eleven minutes ; so that it appears, whenever atmospheric air is taken into the lungs, it returns charged with about 8 per cent. carbonic acid. The faster respiration is performed, the more carbonic acid is given off, and consequently the more oxygen consumed: in this instance it was given off at the rate of fifty-one cubic inches per minute. Thirteenth Experiment. \Ve now proceeded to carry on the respiration of common air for a much longer period than usual, and of course on a much larger quantity. The experiment was made by the same operator who had performed all the others, except the 12th. Eleven mercurial gasometers having been filled, taken off and registered, the operator continued to breathe in the 12th until a mark was made by his colleague upon the scale MDCCCUIVTIJI.

This occupied but a very short space of time. The operator, Without taking his lips from the tube thenfilled twelve more of the mercurial gasometers, which were rregistered as before, and he continued to breathe in thea 12th, until the water gasometer was again replenished; eleven more were then filled, andportions save-d from each: the experiment was completed by a forcible expiration of i66 cubic inches into the 12th; and this last portion: being left for an hour and a half was not perceptibly diminished in volume. rm; ~~C~ub. inches 'Therm.

The smallness of the deficiency, notwithstanding the ex,periments occupied 24tMinutes is a striking circumstance, and leads us to suspect still more strongly, that the deficiency principally arises from the impossibility of always bringing the lutngs to the same state after forcible expiration. 10oo parts of the mixture of expired gas gave 8 carbonic acid, 13 oxygen, 79 azote. 100 Atmospherzc Air and Oxygepn &as Rby e spz'raion. 5 9 Calculation for Carboni, Alrid. 100 987 : 789,76. So 'that`7'89P,76 cubic inhches of carbonic acid gas were given off in 242 j minutes, which gives thirty-two cubic inches per minute. But here it must be noticed that the respiration was more rapid than in the ith experiment, and a larger quantity of carbonic acid given off in the same time VThis agrees with the 12th experiment. We are very much inclined to think that, in ordinary resptration, a great part of the air is returned unaltered, viz. that contained inthe fauces, in the trachea, and probably a portion of that in the larger branches of the bronchia. If this circunmstance be not adverted to in experiments upon small quantities of air, the results can never be correct. There is even a considerable difference in the quality -of the first and last portions of a single inspiration. In some experiments made with a view to this subject, a small quantity of the first portions, given off in a common and natural expiration, wvas received Kn ,a vessel over mercury.; on examination, it only contained S per cent. carbonic acid in other experiments the first portions contain from three to five per cent. I; while th general average appears by the 1 ith, 12th, and i3th experi.. ients, to be about eight. The operator, after rather more than a natural inspiration, expired 2o4cubic inches into the mercurial gasometer, making his utmost efforts to press as much as possible out of the lungs, this contained 9D, per cent. of a rbonic acid.l Here we are to recollect, that these 204 cubic inches contained the first, as well as the last portions; the first portions have been L 1 2 260 AMessrs. ALLEN and PEPYS On thze Chianges produced in proved to contain only from thlr ee to five per cent. ; consequently the last portions must contain more than appears by the average; that is, more than 9.5 per cent. It now appeared to us of consequence to ascertain exactly what happened to a given volu-me of atmospheric air, wheen it wvas inspired and expired as often as possible. Fourteenth ExPrinient.* Three hundred cubic inches of atmospheric air were admitted into the mercurial gasometer G. i. ; the other, G. 2, was empty. The nose being properly secured, and the mouth applied to the tube A, as usual, air was drawn from G. 1, and by half turning the cock, 2, was expired into G. 2. This was repeated until the contents of G. 1 had been made to pass throtugh the lungs, and transmitted to G. 2. The air was then inspired from G. 2, and expired into G. 1, until G. 2 was nearly empty. This was repeated about eight or ten times during three minutes, until respiration became extremely laborious, and the operator desisted. The whole 3o0 cubic inches must have passed eight or ten times through the lungs; and we confidently expected, that on examining the air w-e should have found an unusual proportion of carbonic acid. But ioo parts gave only 9.5 carbonic acid 5.,5 oxygen 85. azote. 1O0 * In this experiment there was obviously no oc(asion to make allowance for the air contained in the tubes and sockets. We find its volume to be eighteen cubic inches. Atmospheric Air and Oxygen Gas by Respiration, 26 Here was an increaseof six parts; in oo of something which the tests for oxygen would not take up, and also a loss of six per cent. oxygen. This seemed to convince us, that under certain circumstances, as during some peculiar alteration in the vital functions, gaseous oxide of carbon, carburetted hydrogen, or some other gas not absorbable by lime water or the tests for oxygen, might be given off from the lungs, and we accordingly determined to repeat CRUIKSIANK'S experiments with hyperoxygenised muriatic acid gas. We procured the gas from hyperoxygenised muriate of potash by means of muriatic acid, and mixing it with a known portion of gaseous oxide of carbon in a flint stopper bottle, the mouth of which was immersed in mercury for twentyfour hours, the gaseous oxide of carbon was converted into carbonic acid gas, as was proved by its effects upon lime water, which, when both the gasses are pure, absorbs them entirely after they have remained together for twenty-four hours; it was plain, therefore, that we had the means of detecting gaseous oxide of carbon, and doubtless carburretted hydrogen, if any should be contained in the expired gas. From a conviction of the importance of these experiments we were determined to take nothing upon trust. Ffteen -h Experiment. We repeated the 14th experiment with a little variation. In this case we employed only one of the mercurial gasometers, into which exactly 300 cubic inches of atmospheric air were admitted. The operator having made an easy expiration, applied his mouth to the cock at the top of the bell glass, and the time being noted, began to breathe; in less s62 Messrs. ALLEN and PEPYS on the Changes produced in than a minute he found himself obliged to take deeper and deeper inspirations ; and at last the efforts of the k11igs to take in air became so strong and sudden that the glass was in some danger of being broken against the sidle of the gasometer. A great sense of oppression and suffocation was now felt in the chest, vision becarme indistinct, and after thee second minute his whole attention seemed to be -withdrawn from surrounding objects and fixed upon the experiment. Hie now experienced that buzz in the ears which is noticed in breathing nitrous oxide, and after the third minute had only sufficient recollection to close the cock after an expiration. This secured the result of the experiment; but he became so perfectly insensible that, on recovering, he was much surprised at finding his friend and the assistant on the table in the act of supporting him. It was noticed that he made thirty-five inspi-i rations during the experiment. We now examined the air which had been so treated. ioo parts contained io carbonic acid, 4 oxygen, 86 azote, 100 In this experiment it is remarkable, that the air which had been so often through the lungs, should only have furnished io per cent. of carbonic acid, while the air which passes them but once contains from 8 to 8.,. Here the oxygen had lost 7 from 21, and the azote had gained 7 upon 79. We knew by previous experiment,* that every cubic inch of * See the experiments on carbonic acid in the Society's Transactions. Atmospheric Air and QOx-ygen iG~as by Respiration. 26.3 carbonic acid gas required exactly a cubic inch of oxygen for its formation; thelten parts of carbonic acid may therefore be reckoned as oxygen, which would make the constitution. of f14 oxygen, the gas after the experiment 86 azo whereas before the experiment it was 21 oxygen 1-79 azote. Now we did not suppose the residuum of 86 to be all azote, thaougha 79 migrht be; therefore seven parts appeared to have been added by this unnatural mode of respiring, and we conjectured the addition might be gaseous oxide of carbon , To ascertain this, we put 40 parts into a flint stopper bottle, and nearly filled it with about ioo parts hyperoxygenised mruriatic, acid, procured as before, and recently prepared the stopper being put in, over distilled water, we plunged it in quicksilver) and filled a second bottle in the same way, as a comparative experiment. We next procured some pure azote, by absorbing the oxygen from a portion of atmospheric air by the saturated green sulphate and simple green sulphate as usual; 40 parts of this azote were mixed with the same proportion of the acid gas as in the other experiment, and the whole suffered to stand ,for forty-eight hours ; at the end of this time the azote was ex-amined, by washing it first in distilled water, and afterwards in the eudiometer with the tests for oxygen; and there 'were still exactly 40 parts left; proving that the hyperoxygenised mturiatic acid gas has no action upon azote. XWe then examined the bottles containing the residuum from the air that had be en so often respired, ad found that it ha not experienced, the slightest change; it was therefore plainly It') Messrs. ALLEN and PEPys on6 the Changes produced in azote; and on reflection, it occurred to us, that if a certain proportion of oxygen had been absorbed or lost in any way, while the azote remained unaltered, there must be an increased proportion of the latter. Now we knew exactly both the bulk and the constitution of the air before the experiment; but it was impossible to know the bulk or volume after the experiment otherwise than by calculation. The 300 cubic inches of atmospheric air before the experiruent contained 21 oxygen, 79 azote in ioo parts, making +nale total quantity of oxygen 63 cubic inches, azote 2317 300 Now if the lunngs be capable of fixing permanently any azote from the atmosphere, it appears by our experiments that the quantity must be very minute, seeing that in t. , ilth, 12th, and 13th experiment, it did not disturb the ares portion of azote, as shewn by the eudiometer; we shall therefore in the present instance assume the volume of azote after the experiment at 237 cubic inches, as before. BuLt after the experiment, every ioo parts consisted In) 86 parts azote, and 14 oxygen, either in the form of carbonic acid, or frees 86 : 14 237 38.580 ThereforC the total quantity of oxygen left after the expert ment would have been 38.,58 cubic inches. Then 237 azote + 38.5$ oxygen 27-5.58; the quantity of gas after respiration would therefore have been 27.#5.58 cubic inches. 300 275.58 the loss of oxygen, or 24.42 cubic inches, Atmospheric Air and Oxygen Gas by Respiration. 2G5 It appears, therefore, that 24.42 cubic inches of oxygen had been absorbed by the system under the circumstances of this experiment. Reviewing the i4th experiment, it appears that the gas after respiration contained 85 per cent. azote, and i5 per cent. oxygen, either in the state of carbonic acid, or free.

Then 237 azote + 41.82 oxygen= 278.82. The total volume -after the experiment appears to be 278.82 cubic inches. i300 -278.82 = 21.18. The loss of oxygen in this case was 21.18 cubic inches. We are disposed to consider the 11th as a standard experiment relative to carbonic acid gas, because the quantity of air respired in a given time is pretty near the average of the first ten experiments; and because it very nearly agrees with the statement of Professor DAVY. In this experiment 292 cubic inches of carbonic acid gas were given off in eleven minutes; the barometer was 30.4, the thermometer S??, the volume being calculated at the mean, viz. barometer 30, thermometer 60?, will be 302 cubic inches given off in eleven minutes, or 39534 cubic inches in twenty-four hours, supposing the production to be uniform during all that period; MDCCCVIII.

But when we consider that in respiration perfectly natural, a much smallcr quantity of air can come in contact with those parts of the lungs calculated to act upon it, the proportion of carbonic acid gas given off in natural respiration, ought probably to stand considerably lower than in the above estimate; but at all events it will be very considerable. Sixteenth Experiment. Having made so manvy experiments upon, atmospheric air, we now proceeded to ascertain the effects produced upon oxygen gas by the process of respiration. The water gasomreter was filled with oxygen gas made from, the hyp eroxygenised mturiate of potash by heat, care having been taken to clear all the tubes, &c. as much as possible of common air, by forcing a quantity of oxygen gas through them. One hundred parts from the water gasometer being treated wxith the usual tests in the Eudiometer, a residuum of onlys 2.5 was left; so that 97.5 per cent. were pure oxygen, and, the rest azoteAtmospheric Air and Oxygen Gas by Respiration. 67 Tlhe register of the water apparatus being noticed, and the operator having prepared himself as usual by a forced expiration, began to respire; his pulsewas 72, and at the end of 9 minutes and twenty seconds, the experiment was concluded by a forced expiration, when the pulse was raised to 88.

Atmospheric Air and Oxygen _Gas by Respiration'. 269 It appears, at first sight, that i77.o8 cubic inches of oxygen were mnissing, but great part of this may be accounted. for, by adverting to the state of thae lungs after the experiment. The addition of 1i o.o8 cubic inches of azote, we consider asa arising from that portion still retained in the lungs, notwithstanding; the forced expiration at the beginning of the ex-t periment, and considering that in the 14th and i15th experiment, where the same air was repeatedly breathed, the proportion of azote was in the one case 8S, and in the other86 per cent. It seems fair to presunme, that the residual air contained in the lungs after a forced expiration may amount in ioo parts, to not more than 1G oxygen and 84 azote: any one who reflects upon the structure of the lungs, and the minute ramifications of the extremities of the bronchial vessels; and' when he also considers that those parts of the lungs with which the air comes in contact, if spread out, would present a surface equal to that of the superficies of the whole body; and lastly, that this viscus is so exceedingly spongy and porous, that when once inflated, it is ever after impossible by ordinary mechanical means to expel the air completely, he will easily perceive, not only that a large portion of air must remain for' a considerable time in contact withthe internal surface of the lungs, where it is liable to lose a portion of its oxygen,, but also that the residual quantity of' air in the lungs, after the most violent attempts at expiration may be. very considerable.

The observed deficiency in this experiment was 58. The deficiency in this case, and in the former experiment with oxygen, though comparatively small, when contrasted with the quantity of gas respired, is larger than the average with atmospheric air; it seems probable, therefore, that a portion may be detained in the system. It must be remembered that what we call residual gas, is not only that contained in the substance of the Kings, and: in its appehdages, but also that contained in the farces andl mouth.

In this recital of experiments, which have occupied a considerable portion of time, and attention, we have endeavoured to give a plain statement of facts from which every one may draw conclusions for him.self; we shalt here, however, take the liberty of briefly recapitulating the principal of those facts, and submitting what seems to us the most obvious inferences. 1. It appears that the quantity of carbonic acid gas emitted is exactly equal, bulk for bulk, to the oxygen consumed, and therefore there is no reason to conjecture that any water is formed by a union of oxygen and hydrogen in the lungs. 2. Atmospheric air once entering the lungs, returns charged with from 8 to 8.-5 per cent. carbonic acid gas, and when, the contacts are repeated almost as frequently as possible onlv o per cent, is eitnitted. The 12th and S3lth experimr ents prove, that when the inspirations and expirations are more rapid than usual, a larger quantity of carbonic acid is emitted in a given time, but the proportion is nearly the same, or about 8 per cent. The proportions of carbonic acid gas, in the first and last portions of' a deep inspiration, difier as widely as from 3.5 to 9.5 per cent. 3. Considering the lith as a standard e:x-periment, it appe crs that a middie sized J in, aged about t hirty-eight yea-sr, aimi whose pulse is seventy on an average, gives oYf 3OO cuPiC cSo iMess Ms. ALLEN a;d IREPYS o; the Changes produced ii inches of carbonic aid gas from his lungs in eleven minutes, and supposing the production uniform for twenty-four hours, the total quantity in that period would 'be 39534 cubic inches weighing 18683 grains; the carbon, in which is 53 grains, or rather more than i l oz. troy, the oxygen consumed in the same time will be equal inll volume to the carbonic acid gas, but it is evident, that the quantity of carbonic acid gas, emitted in a given time, must depend very much upon the circumstances under which respiration is performed; and here it may be proper to notice that all the experiments were made between breakfast and dinner. 4. When respiration is attended with distressing circums stances, as in the 14th and 1f5th experiments, there is reason to conclude that a portion of oxygen is absorbed; and in tne last of these experiments, we may remark, that as the oxygen decreases in quantity, perception gradually ceases, and we may suppose that life would be completely extinguished on the total abstraction of oxygen. a. A larger proportion of carbonic acid gss formed by Qthe human subject from oxygen, than from atmospheric air. 6. An easy, natural inspiration, is from 16 to 17 cubic inches in the subject of these experiments, who makes about 19 in a minute; this, however, will vary in different individuals, and perhaps we ought to estimate the quantity of carbonic acid gas, given off in perfectly natural respiration, at somewhat less, and most likely at considerably less, than in the statement above, when we consider that in short inspirations the quantity of air which has reached no farther than the fauces, trachea, &c.bears a much larger proportion to the whole mass respired, than when the inspirations are deep. Atmosppheric Air and Oxygenz Gas by Respiration. 281 7. No hydrogen, nor any other gas, appears to be evolved dUring the process of respiration. 8. The general average of the deficiency in the total amount of common air inspired, appears to be very small, amounting only to about 6 parts in i coo, and we are inclined to attribute it in great measure to the difficulty in exhausting the lungs as completely after an experiment as before it; the first expiration being made into the open air, the last into the apparatus. 9. The experiments upon oxygen gas prove that the quant tity of air remaining in the lungs and its appendages is very considerable, and that, without a reference to this circumstance, all experiments upon small quantities of gas are liabe to inaccuracy. Other important conclusions might perhaps be drawn fromt the facts related in this paper, but having already trespassed largely upon the time of the Society, we shall abstain from any farther remarks, until we bring forward a new series of experiments.
