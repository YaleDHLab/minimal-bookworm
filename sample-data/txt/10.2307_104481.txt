V. Extract of a Letter from Mr. B-B---r, containing an Account, in Pounds and Ounces, of the surprising Quantities of Food devoured by a Boy, 12 Years old, in 6 successive Days, who labour'd under a Canine Appetite, at Black Barnsley in Yorkshire. Communicated by Dr. Mortimer, Secret. R. S. April 15. 1745. THE Boy was regular as other Children, till about a Year ago, when this extraordinary Craving of Appetite first began; which afflicts him to such a Degree, that (they tell us) if he was not fed as he called out for it, he would gnaw the very Flesh off his own Bones; so that, when awake, he is constantly devouring; it can hardly be said eating, because nothing passes his Stomach, all is thrown up again. ~ Read April 25. 1745.
