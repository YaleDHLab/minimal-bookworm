[ 325 ] XIX. On the Thermal Effects of Fluids in]l Motion.-Part III. On the Changes of Temperature experienced by bodies moving through Air. By Professor W. THOMSON, Aid., LL.D., F.B.S. &c., and J. P. JOULE, LL.I., F.B.S. &c. Received June 21,-Read June 21, 1860. THis interesting branch of our researches has been prosecuted by us from time to time since 1856. In the spring of that year we commenced our experiments by trying the effect of whirling thermometers in the air. This process had been confidently recommended as a means of obtaining the temperature of the atmosphere, but we were sure that the plan was not absolutely correct, and one of us had, as early as 1847, explained the phenomena of " shooting stars " by the heat developed by bodies rushing into our atmosphere. In our early experiments we whirled a thermometer by means of a string, alternately quickly and slowly, and it was found that the thermometer was invariably higher after quick than after slow whirling, in some cases the difference amounting to as much as a degree FAHRENHEIT. We also succeeded in exhibiting the same phenomenon by whirling a thermo-electric junction. In 1857 we resumed the subject, using an apparatus consisting of a wheel worked by hand, communicating rapid rotation to an axle, at the extremity of which an arm carrying a thermometer, with its bulb outwards, was fixed. The distance between the centre of the axle and the thermometer bulb was 39 inches. The thermometers made use of were filled with ether or chloroform, and had, the smaller 275, and the larger 330 divisions to the degree C. The lengths of the cylindrical bulbs were -9 and 1-%inch, their diameters 26 and *48 of an inch respectively. The method of experimenting was to revolve the thermometer bulb at a certain velocity until we knew by experience that it had obtained the full thermal effect, then to stop it as suddenly as possible and observe the temperature. Alternately with these observations others were made to ascertain the temperature after a slow velocity, the effect due to which was calculated from the other observations, on the hypothesis that it varied with the square of the velocity. In all cases the results in the Tables are means of several experiments. MDCCCLx 2 X 326 PROFESSOR W. THOMSON AND DR. J. P. JOULE ON THE SERIES I.-Bulb '26 inch diameter.

The arrangement will be understood from the adjoining sketch, where a is the axle of the whirling apparatus. b a block of wood placed on the end of the axle; to this is attached c c', a copper tube, -3-ths of an inch in diameter, with a hole in its side. d e is a copper wire, which, entering the hole passes along the axis of the tube, from which it is insulated by non-conducting material. df is an iron wire soldered at d to | the copper wire. gyg are thick copper wires, communicating at their remote ends with the galvanometer. e_ They apply to the tube and wire with a springing force, perfect contact being maintained by keeping the touching surfaces clean, and lubricated with oil. A thin piece of wood, not drawn in the sketch, was attached to the block of wood. It was made to extend to within 1, 2, or 3 feet off d, according as the velocity was to be THERMAL EFFECTS OF FLUIDS IN MOTION. 327 slow or quick. The wires being tied to it, were prevented from twisting out of their proper position. The distance of d from the axis of revolution was generally 44 inches. The thermal value of the indications of the galvanometer was repeatedly ascertained by direct observations of the effect of heating the junctions. The following Tables comprise the results of those experiments in which the junction was placed at right angles to the direction of its motion.

Taking, therefore, the means of the foregoing results, and rejecting all those obtained from a velocity under 100 feet per second, we obtain the following summary:Material of the V Velocity due whirled cylinder.

In the next experiments we whirled the junctions parallel to the direction of ,_ motion.

The absence of any considerable effect arising from the shape of the body whirled, was also shown by the following results obtained with a junction of flattened wires a quarter of an inch broad and one-thirtieth of an inch thick.

The phenomena hitherto observed seemed to point to the effect of stopping air as a cause, since 145 feet per second is the velocity of air equivalent to the quantity of heat required to raise its substance, under constant pressure, by 10 Cent. temperature; and it was reasonable to infer that a portion of the effect was lost by radiation. The following experiments, made with a junction of fine wires covered loosely with cotton-wool or tow, enabled us to eliminate all effects but those due to stopped air. Their results will be found to agree closely with theory. SERIES IX.

N.B. The basket was so open that its orifices amounted to half the entire area. In several of our experiments with very slow velocities there appeared to be a greater evolution of heat than could be due to the stopping of air. This circumstance induced us to try various modifications of the surface of the whirled body. In the first instance we covered the bulb of the thermometer used in the second series of experiments with five folds of writing-paper, and then obtained the following results: t3e30 PROFESSOR W.

We were thus led to try the effect of a further increase of what we may call "fluid friction." In the next series the bulb was, _ _ -wrapped with fine iron wire. SERIES XI. Velocity due to P?

It is also evident that, as the velocity increases, this thermal cause decreases; for at a velocity of 150 feet per second the thermal effect is such as would be due to the influence of stopped air alone. In prosecuting still further this part of our subject we made the following arrangement. A disc of mill-board, 32 inches in diameter, was fixed to the end of the axis of the whirling apparatus. An ether thermometer, whose bulb was one-fourth of an inch in diameter, was tied by its stem to the face of the disc, so that the bulb was 15 inches distant from the axis of revolution, and 1 inch from the margin of the disc. In the following Table the first five experiments were made with the above arrangement, but in the last two a thermo-electric junction of thin copper and iron wires, tied closely to the mill-board, was substituted for the ether thermometer.

The thermal effect appears even to increase at a slower rate than simply with the velocity. This phenomenon may, we think, be ascribed to the internal fluid friction of the particles 332 PROFESSOR W. THOMSON AND DR. J. P. JOULE ON THE of air among themselves, which Professor STOKES has proved to exist, by his researches on the motion of pendulums. We may easily apprehend that in such experiments as our last, the entire face of the disc is covered with a film of air, which -revolves along with it at very slow velocities. As the velocity increases there will still be a film of 'air adhering to the disc, but with the difference that it will be constantly replaced. by fresh stopped air, the thermal effect. of which will ultimately be the only recognizable phenomenon. A very interesting and important branch of our subject was to inquire into the thermal phenomena which take place at the surface of a sphere passing rapidly through air. Some of our, experiments on this subject have been made by blowing air from a large bellows against a ball; others by whirling a ball or sphere in the air by means of the apparatus already described. We shall commence by describing the latter, in some of which a thermo-electric junction was employed, and in others an ether thermometer.

In the next experiments we whirled a thin glass globe, 3 58 inches in diameter, placed at a distance of 38 inches from the axle of the apparatus. The small bulb of an ether thermometer was kept in contact with the glass. THERMAL EFFECTS OF FLUIDS IN MOTION. 333 SERIES XVI.

All the results will be seen to indicate, as might have been anticipated, that the junction within the bellows was warmer than any part of the ball.

The general result is that at slow velocities of air there is a gradual increase of temperature from the anterior to the posterior pole, but the reverse at high velocities. We observed a great effect for slow velocities at the commencement of an experiment, which gradually declined on continued blowing. This phenomenon was apparently owing to circumstances in connexion with the temperature of the orifice and of the bellows. The causes of the thermal effects on the surface of balls slowly passing through air are very complicated, as they arise from the effects of As stopped air, fluid friction, and varied pressures. In order, if possible, to throw some light on these, we made the following observations: 1st. That when the 12-inch globe passed through the air at the velocity of about 12 feet per second or under, the air at the equatorial part moved in the reverse direction. . We did not observe the velocity, if it existed, at which this phenomenon ceased to take place t. | 2nd. An ivory ball, 1-7 inch diameter, had holes drilled from points of the surface 90? asunder, which holes met at the centre of the ball. Into the lower one (see adjoining figure) a bent glass tube, partly filled with water, was cemented; in the other, at c, a porous wooden plug was placed. It was then found that when c was made the anterior pole in a blast from the bellows, a pressure was experienced able to ^ _* See ' Proceedings of the Royal Society,' June 18, 1857, p. 558. 336 ON THE THERMAL EFFECTS OF FLUIDS IN MOTION. produce a difference of level in the tubes b and d equal to 2-5 inches. When c was put in the equatorial position, there was, on the contrary, a suction equal to 1 2 inch. When c was made the posterior pole there was also a suction, equal, however, to only 0 1 inch. Having tied a thick fold of silk over the orifice d, we, tried the sa-me thing in a strong breeze of wind, when we found that on making c the anterior pole, we had a, pressure amounting to 0-6 of an inch; on making c equatorial, a suction of 0 3; and on making c the posterior pole, a suction of. 0 05 inch. We have not hitherto been able to detect any change in the thermal effect, owing to the whistling sound of wire or other bodies rapidly whirled. We think.it possible that this vibratory action decreases the resistance and the evolution of heat. Some of the sounds produced are interesting and worthy of further investigation. When a small piece of paper was attached to the revolving wire, we obtained a continuous succession of loud cracks similar to those of a whip. But although this and other parts -of our subject remain to be cleared up, we believe that it will be found that at all high velocities the thermal effect arises entirely from stopped air, and thus is independent of the shape and mass of the body, and ofthe temperature and density of the atmosphere. From some experiments described in the 'Proceedings of the Royal Society' of June 19, 1856, p. 183, we inferred that a body placed in a stream of air moving with a. velocity of 1780 feet per second, was raised 1370 C. above the temperature of that stream. This gives 152 feet per second as the velocity due to 10, while our direct results, given in the present paper, indicate 179. It must be obvious that a thermometer placed in the wind registers the temperature of the air, plus the greater portion, but not the whole, of the temperature due to the vis viva of its motion. In a place perfectly sheltered from the wind, the temperature of a thermometer immersed in the air will be that of the wind, plus the whole temperature due to the vis viva of the moving air. In accordance with this we have found that a thermometer placed in a sheltered situation, such as on the top of a wall opposite the wind, indicates a higher temperature than when it is exposed to the blast. A minute examination of these phenomena cannot fail to interest the meteorologist.
