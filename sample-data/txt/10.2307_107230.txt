157 2 H1. On -the Precession of the Equinoxes*. By the Rev. Abram Robertson, M. A. F. R. S. Savilian Professor of Geometry fin the University of Oxford. Read December i8, i806. PERHAPS the solution of no other problem, in natural philosophy, has so often baffled the attempts of mathematicians as that of determining the precession of the equinoxes, by the theory of gravity. The phenomenon itself was observed about one hundred and fifty years before the Christian aera, but Sir ISAAC NEWTON wa!s the first who endeavoured to estimate its& magnitude by the true principles of motion-, combined with' the attractive influence of the sun and moon on the spheroidal figure of the earth. It has always been allowed, by those competent to judge, that his investigations relating to the subject evince the same transcendent abilities as are displayed in the other parts of his immortal work, THE MATHEMATICAL PRINCIPLES OF NATURAL PHILOSOPHY, but, for more than half a century past, it has been justly asserted that he made a mistake in -his process, which rendered his conclusions error neous. Since the detection of this error, some of the most eminent mathematicians in Europe have attempted solutions of the problem. Their success has been various; but their invest4-. gations may be arranged under three general heads. Under the first of these may be placed such' as lead to a wrong MVDCCCVII.1 I ,58 Mr. ROBERTSON on the Precession conclusion, in consequence of a mistake committed in some part of the proceedings. The second head may be allotted to those in which the conclusions may be admitted as just, but rendered so by the counteraction of opposite errors. Such may be ranked under the third head as are conducted without error fatal to the conclusion, and in which the result is as near the truth as the subject seems to admit. The authors of those investigations of each of the three descriptions, are entitled to much praise. Their productions afford the most unquestionable proofs of great talents, great zeal, and great perseverance, exerted in the cultivation of science. The mistakes committed in those of the two first descriptions, and the obscurity and perplexity with which those of the third may be charged are, in my opinion, to be attributed to the same cause, the uncultivated state of that particular department of the doctrine of motion, which coinstitutes the appropriate foundation for the solution of the problem. The department to which I allude is that of compound rotatory motion. In consequence of this persuasion I have, in the first nine of the following articles, endeavoured to investigate the pri-. mary properties of compound rotatory motion from clear and unexceptionable principles. The-disturbing solar force on the spheroidal figure of the earth is then calculated, and the angular velocity which it produces is afterwards compared with that of the diurnal revolution, 'by means of the properties of rotatory motion previously demonstrated. The quantity of annual. precession is thenqn calculated in the usual way, and also that of nutation, as far as they are produced by the disturbiiig force of the sun. ofthe Equitnoxes. i. Let C, (Plate II. Fig. 1 ) be the centre of two circular arcs AB, EF, which are the measures of the angles ACB, ECF; and let CB cut EF in D. Then, as the sectors ACB, ECD are similar, CA.: CE:: AB: ED = CE xAR But (Eu. 33. VI.) ED : EF: : the angle ACB :the angle ECF; and therefore CEXAB EF: <A.CB: <ECF. Consequently CExABx<ECF CA x EF x < ACB; and therefore AB: EF: CA < ACB .CEx<ECF. 2. Let ACB, GEF (Fig. 2.) be two angles, of which the arcs AB, GF are the measures; and the radii CA, EG not being necessarily equal, let the sines BK, FQ be equal to one another. Let BL[, FM be tangents to the curves; and let .HD, MN be parallel to CA, EG respectively, and meet BK, FQ in D, N, as represented. Then as CBH, BDH are right angles, the triangles CBK, BHD are equiangular, and CB BK: BH: HD or its equal KL, if HL be drawn parallel to BK, and meet CA in L. Consequently BK RH For the same reasons, if MP be parallel to FQ and meet EG in P. FQ-Air; and therefore as BK, FQ are, by hypothesis, equalCBXKL EFxQ Hence CB x KL x FM EF x QP eqal H ~FM xBH, and BH:FM:: CBxKL:EFxQP. -. If, therefore, we suppose straight lines CH, EM to be drawn and that the angles BCH, FEM are indefinitely small, and generated in the same time by the revolution of CB, EF respectively, then BHI, FM may be considered as circular arcss and by article i, BH: FM:: CB x < BCH : EFx <FEM. Hence by article 2, (and -i. V.) CB x < BCH: EF x < FEM CB x KL EF x QP, and therefore < BCH: < FEM:: KL 6o Mr. RoBERTSON On the Precession QP. Consequently, during the generation of the angles BCH, FEM, the angular velocity of CB is to the angular velocity of EF as KL to QP. 4. If ACB (Fig. 3.) be any plane angle, and from any point E, EF be drawn perpendicular to AC and EH perpendicular to CB, then the angle FEH is equal to the angle ACB. For let HK be drawn perpendicular to AC,, and let EH be produced to G. First let ACB be an obtuse angle, and then < ACB=<KHC + < HKC+ < KHC + < CHG= <KHG =( 9. I.) < FEll. Secondly, ACB -being an acute angle, the right angle GHC = < GHK + < KHC= <KHC + < HCK = (15. I. ) < KHC + < ACB. Consequently the angle ACB = < GHK =< FE. 5. Let G (Fig. 4.) be the centre of gravity of a body, and AB, DC two axes passing through _G; and, while the body revolves round AB, let AB and consequently the whole body revolve round DC, the periodical times of these revolutions not being necessarily equal ; it is required to determine the direction and angular velocity with; which any particle of the body revolves in consequence of this compound motion. Suppose the simple motion of the body about AB to be such, that during the revolution the parts towards D from AB would rise above the plane, on wvhich the figure is drawn, and the parts towards C sink below it. And suppose the simple motion about DC to be such, that during the revolution the parts towards A from DC would rise above the plane of the figure, and those towards B sink below it. Let P (Fig. by.) be a particle of the body, above the plane, and letPR be a perpendicular to the said plane.* With the ce'ntre G suppose *The axis DC, and the line RM are intentionally omitted in Fig. 5, with a view to prevent confusion in the figure. of the Equinoxes. 61 a spherical superficies to be described, passing through P, and let ADBC be the great circle of this sphere in the plane on which the whole is represented. Let the straight lines EF, HK pass through R, and be perpendicular to AB, DC respectively; and let EPF, HPK be lesser circles of the sphere, EF being a diameter of the one, and HK a diameter of the other. Then it is evident, that by the simple motionI of the body about AB only the particle P would move inthe circumference IFPE ; and by the simple motion of the body about DC only, P' would move in the circumference HPK. Let the indefinitely small arcs Ps, Pq be those which P would describe in equal times with the revolutions about AB, DC separately, and let the parallelogram Pqps be completed on the spherical superficies. Then it is evident, from the com-,position of motion, that the direction and velocity of P, in consequence of the compound motion, is as the diagonal Pp of the parallelogram Pqps. Let RrMN be the orthographical projection of Pqps on the plane ADBC, and then as PR is perpendicular to this plane, it is evident that RrMN is a parallelogram, and that its diagonal RM is the direction and velocity of P in the projection, in consequence of the compound motion. It therefore follows, from article Ij, as RN is the angular velocity about the axis AB, and Rr that about the axis DC, that RM is the angular velocity about the axis, round which the body is caused to revolve by the compound motion. 6. The same things being supposed, and the parallelogram RrMN being the lsame in Fig. 4 as in Fig. 5, let RM pro.duced meet the circumference in L and Q, and the diameter TGS, at right angles to LQ, is the axis sought. The same axis mrlay be obtained in the following manner. 62 Mr. ROBERTSON on the Precession In GB take GV equal to RN; and in GC take GW equal to Rr, and VW being drawn it will be parallel to the axis TS. For as NR is perpendicular to AB, and Rr or NM to DC, by article 4, the angle RNM, or (.34 I.) its equal RrM, is equal to the angle VGW. Also, on account of the equals, VG: GW ::'Mr: rR, and therefore (6. VI.) the angles rRM, GWV are equal. Let TS meet HK in 0, and LQ in I; and let DC meet HK in X. Then as the angle OIR is equal to the angle OXG, each being a right one, and as the angles 10R, XOG are equal, the angle IRO, or MRr is equal to the angle OGX. Consequently the alternate angles XGO, GWV are equal, and therefore TS, VW are parallel. Hence it is evident that if the axes AB, DC, and also GV, GW the angular velocities round them be given, the axis TS is easily found, being parallel to VW. It is proper to observe that GV, GW are to be set off on that side of TS towards which the body is moving, in consequence of the revolutions round DC, AB. 7. From the last article it is evident that VW is equal to RM, and consequently equal to the angular velocity, with which the body revolves about the axis TS. If therefore CGB be aright anglethenthe angular velocityVW= V/VGI+ GW2 In other cases the value of VW may be easily calculated by plane Trigonometry. 8. It is to be remarked for the sake of precision, that the linear velocity, of any point, is as the angular velocity multiplied into the radius of the circle in whose circumference it revolves. Thus the linear velocity Ps (Fig. A.) of the point P in the circumference FPE, is as its angular velocity in the same, multiplied into the radius of the circle FPE, as is evi-of the Equinoxes. 63 dent from article A. In the following articles, linear velocity is meant when no adjective is annexed to the word velocity. -9. Let AB, DC (Fig. 6.) be the two axes about which separately the body would revolve, as stated in article I, and let TS be the axis about which it revolves, in consequence of a combination of these two revolutions. Let TE be at right angles to AB, and meet it in H, and let TF be at right angles to DC and meet it in K; and let GV, GW be the angular velocities about AB, DC, as in the preceding articles. Then it follows, from the last article, that the velocity of the point T, by the revolution about the axis AB only, is equal to GVxHT. And as this velocity is in the direction of a tangent at T to the circle of which TE is a diameter, and as this circle is perpendicular to the plane ADBC, the direction of this velocity is evidently perpendicular to the plane ADBC. The direction of this velocity of the point, T is also upwards from the plane of the figure, agreeable to the statement in article 5. Again, by the revolution about the axis DC only, the velocity of T is equal to GW x KT, and, for the foregoing reasons, the direction of this velocity of the point T is perpendicularly downwards below the plane, according to article i. Now as TS is the axis about: which -the body revolves, in consequence of the combined revolutions about AB, DC, every point in TS is rendered quiescent by -the compound motions. It is therefore evident that GVxHT= GWWxKT. lo. The revolutions about DC, AB may be supposed to be caused by instantaneous impulses at A and -D, made at the same time, or at different times; or-they may be supposed to be occasioned 'by the agency of constant forces, like that of d4o Mr. ROBERTSON on the Precession gravity. For if the causes be adequate to the production of the same velocities, taken separately, and in the same directions the velocity and direction of a particle will be the same from their combined influence upon it, whether these causes be impulses or constant forces. As the body is understood to be in free space, if the causes of the revolutions, taken separately, be instantaneous impulses, and made at the same time, immediately after their agency the body will revolve about the axis TS, and it will continue so to revolve with an uniform velocity. If whilst the body is revolving with an uniform velocity about the axis DC a constant force begin to act at D, so as to cause a ten-. dency to revolution about AB, as stated in article A, and continue afterwards to act at T, the pole of the new axis, from a combination of the constant agency at the new pole and the uniform velocity about DC, the axis TS will incessantly shift its position. Such exactly are the circumstances to which the earth is subject as to the production of the precession of the equinoxes. At the vernal equinox, for instance, a straight line drawn from the centre of the sun to that of the earth is in the plane of the equator, and therefore, as equal portions of the protuberant matter of the earth are above and below the ecliptic, the attractive power of the sun has no tendency to alter the position of the equator. But, in consequence of the earth's motion in its orbit, it very soon after the equinox presents a different position of the equator to the sun. The equilibrium of the protuberant parts of the earth, above and below the ecliptic, and towards the sun, is then done away, of the Equizoxes. 6 and the attractionr of the sun on that side, where the greatest quantity of protuberant matter is, tends to bring down the equator into the ecliptic, or to cause the earth to revolve about a diameter of the: equator. This attractive influence of the sun gradually increases& a little till the summer solstic; it then gradually decreases in the same degree till the autumnal equinox, when it Vanishes. From the autumnal equinox to the: winter solstice It again gradually increases a little; and it thenr gradually decreases in the same degree till the vernal equinox when, it :againr vanishes. This recurrence aand continuance of action is annually repeated. Similar observations apply to the attraction of the moon on the protuberant parts of the earth. When a straight line drawn from her centre to that of the earth is in the plane of the equ-ator, the attractive influence of the moon has no ten-v dency to change the: position of the equator, but in other situations, the attraction of the moon tends to bring the equator of the earth into the plane of the moon's orbit, or causes the earth to move round a diameter of the equator. The recurrences of the moon's action on the protuberant parts of the earth, and the tilmes of their continuing, are repeated every month. These efhects of the SUn and moon are to be considered, separately; and for the reasons already stated, each of the actions, combined with the diurnal revolution of the earth, may be considered aCs a particular case of compound rotatory motion. It is needless, however, after investigating the efficts of the sun's action, an1d expressing them in general formul'7 to go over the samee steps for ascertaining those of the moon, MDCCCVII. K 66 Mr. ROBERTSON on the Precession as they may be inferred from the former after making dte allowance for the different circumstances under which these two Tremote bodies act on the protuberant parts of the earth. I now proceed to estimate the force with which the sUTn tends to cause -the earth to revolve about a diameter -of the equator. Iit. Let S be the centre of the sun (Fig. 7.) C that of the earth.; P, L the -poles, PL the axis; and let a plane -passing through SC, PL cut the earth in the meridian PEAQB. Let EQ be the -diameter of the equator, and let IDF, the diameter of the spheroid in the plane SPCL, be .at right angles to SC.. Let SC cut tthe meridian EPQL in A, B. and G being supposed a particle of matter in this meridian, let GH parallel to SC meet DF i4l H, and let SG be drawn. Let M be the quantity -of matter in the sun, or its absolute attracting power, and M then sM is its force upon the particle G, in the direction SQ M. and is its force upon a particle at C, in the direction SC. But a force whose power and direction is as GS is equal to a force Whose power and direction is as GC, together with a force whose power and direction is as CS; and as the force whose power and direction is as GC, is directed to the centre it has no tendency to alter the position of the axis PL, and' therefore may be neglected in the present enquiry. Now, by Mechanics, SG.: SC:: . ~ Mx5C the force of the sun on S2SG' the particle G, in the direction CS or HG. Now as the distance of the sun from the earth is indefinitely great when compared to the diameter DF, its force on any particle in DF is equal to its force on, a particle at C, and therefore the sun's force on a particle at H is as SC Consequently, as the sun's -tf he Equioxesforce oi~ wrticle theMXSC force on the particle G, in the same direction, is as SG' the disturbing force of the Sun, by its action on the particle G is MXSEC M Mf X SC V M` or GHfor SG may be considered as equal to SC GH4. But as, SC is indefinitely great with reSC sp~ct to GHI, s VI by actal division may be considered as 3GHI equal to so + SC, and therefore the disturbing force on the 3M xGHI particle at G is 3 Let K be aparticle in the meridian, but on the opposite sideof DF to that on which. G is situated. Let KN, parallel to SC, Jmeet DF in N and Asup ose SK to be drawn. Then the force of the sun on K being I, for the same reasons as before, its force upon it in the direction of SC or KN is M K Sc SC +KNVP' and after a reduction similar to the foregoing, the sun's disMx KN turbing force on K is 3 Hence it is evident, supposing M and SC to be constant, that the disturbing force of the sun on any particle in the meridian PELQ is as the distance of the particle from DF; and that the sign of the force in the half DAF nearest to S is positive, but the sign of the force in the other half DBF is negative. This difference of the sigys indicates that the particles on the opposite sides of DF have a directly opposite tendency, as toI direction, in affecting the position of the axis PL, or equator EQ; and the samne is evident from the following considerations. As the disturbing force is as its distance from DF, it' has no effect on particles in DF, and therefore the inertia* of * By this expression that part of the inertia is ineant which opposes the disturbing force of the sun; and the same is to be understood in the follwing expressions. K2 68 Mr. ROBERTSON on the Precession particles in .DF may be considered as equal to the sun's dis9 turbing force, on the principle of action and reaction being, equal as to magnitude, but directly contrary as to direction;. But on the side of DF nearest to S the disturbing force is greater than the inertia of any particle G, and it therefore urges the particle from DF towards 5, by a pvessure whose direction and power is asHG. On the side of DF opposite to S the disturbing force is less than the inertia of any particle K, and therefore the inertia of K opposes the disturbing force of the sun by a pressure whose direction is from N towards K, and whose power is as NK. 1l2. As, by the nature of the spheroid PELQ is an ellipse, let GK be the diameter conjugate to DF, and let VI, parallel to DF, meet it in T, and AB in R.; and then VI is bisected in T. Let RI be bisected in v, and let w, q be two points in RI, equally distant fromn R and I respectively. Let a EC, and elm the disturbing force 'of the sun at the distance of EC from DF. Then by the preceding article, a: RC:: d xa RC. --the force at 11 or at any point in VI, as any two points in VI are equally distant from DF. Now it i's evident that the disturbing force on a particle at R, or on any particle in AG, has no power to turn the ellipse about C; but the force on a. particle at w tends to turn the ellipse about the centre, fbr it is applied at the end of the lever Rw. Consequently, by what has been already proved in this article, and by the property d of the lever, the force on , to turn the ellipse is x RC x Rw. For the same reasons,, the force on, q to turn the ellipse is. d x RC x Rq, and therefore the force on w and: q combined-, d to turn, thle ellipse,` I'S X RC x. RI, for Rw + Rq =RL.~ of the Equiwnoxos. 6 He-nce, as Rvor R2 expresses the number of particles in Rt or vI, it follows that the force of all the particles in RI, to turn the ellipse, 'is x RC x RI x -x RC x RIP. In the same way it may be proved that the force of all the particles d in VR, to turn the ellipse, is x RC x RV'. But the force of the particles in RI. tends to turn the ellipse upwards in the direction FAD, and the force of the particles in RV tends to turn it downwardsin the contrary direction DAF.R The force of all the particles in VI, therefore, to turn the ellipse, i, x RC x RV -RP. But as TV is half the sum of RV, RI, it follows that RT is half their difference, and therefore RV,R1 VI X 2RT. Consequently the force of the particles in VI, to turn the ellipse, is XRC x VI x 2RT-a X RC X VI x RT. '3. Let cCG, b-CDfGH) g= CH, y -CR, and x CT.

Hence, when x becomes equal to c, the force of all the particles in the semi-ellipse DGF, to turn; the ellipse, is equal to the semi-ellipse DGF x dfij x C tlthe semi-ellipse DGFx a X x g. By article i1, a C 4+therefore, the force of all the particles in the whole ellipse, which tend to turn it about the centre, is the whole ellipse PELQ x xg of tbe Equinozes. A. The -other circumstances as to the figure being the same as before, let the straight line GV (Fig. 8.) touch the ellipse in G, meet" QE in V and CM parallel to GH in M. Let GI be perpendic ular to QE and meet it in I, and let GHI meet EQ in T. Then, by a well known property of the ellipse, CI : IT: : EQ: its parameter; and therefore by the nature of a parmeter, or three proportionals, CI: IT:: CE2 : CP2, and C~xCP2 l X andby ITS= . Hence CT -CI-IT = CIl--*I& --%-L; n by CE2another well known property of the ellipse, CV . Consequently CT xCV CE, CP2. Now as MAC is part of the straight line drawn from the centre of the sun to that of the earth, the angle ACE is the sun's declination, and as DC is perpendicular to AC, the angle -ECD is the complement of the declination. Let m -the sine of the declination, and ni its cosine, and then, radius being 1, CT: CH: 1 : in, and CV : CM or (34. I.) its equal GH:: i : n.

Consequenty, using the samne notation as in the last article, and 2~~~~~~ putting e -CP, as; CT xCV co CP , we have a2_et :fg: :1 : nzn, and J a2-..t ex mnn. If therefore X denote the area of the ellipse PELQ, by the last article, the force of all the particles to turn the ellipse is tt X X as-e2 x X. -6. Let PELQ be the same ellipse in Fig. 9, as in the 7thl and 8th figures. Let the spheroid be cut by a plane parallel to PELQ, (Fig. 9,) and let the section be the ellipse HKNG; and let this ellipse be supposed to be above the plane of the paper on which PELQ is represented. Again, let the spheroid be cut by a plane passing through PL, and perpendicular to the plane PELQ, and let the line of common section of this 7 G Mr. ROBERTSON o7 the Precession plane with the ellipse HKNG be HN, and let this ellipse be cut by the plane, of the equator in the line KG. Then FIN (14. X.) is parallel to PL, and KG to EQ; and therefore (lo. XI) IHN, KG cut one another at right angles. Again, as the axis PL is perpendicular to the plane of the equator, the plane of the equator is perpendicular (i8. XI.) to the ellipse PELQ. T'he planes passing through thne centre of the spheroid and the lines HN, KG are therefore perpendicular to the ellipse PELQ, and consequently (19. XI.) the straight line passing through the centre of the spheroid, and the point in whic H FN, KG cut one another, is perpendicular to HN, KG and also to PL, EQ. Consequently as the equator is a circle, KG (3. III.) is bisected by HN; and as HN is parallel to PI it is a double ordinate to the diameter of the equator passing through the point in which FIN, KG cut oneanother, and is therefore bisected in this point. Hence, as by a well known property of the spheroid, the ellipses PELQ, HKNG are similar, it is evident that KG is the transverse, and FIN the conjugate axis of the ellipse HKNG. Let u = the distance of the centre of the ellipse HKNG fromn the centre of the speroid, and then as the points E, K, G, Q are in the circumference of the equator, a straight line drawn from the centre of the spheroid to K or G is equal to a, and half of the straight line KG =a2/_u2. Again, as the ellipses PELQ, HKNG are similar, a :'e :: va u a12 -half of HN; and a2: axuZ:: X: al x X = the area of the ellipse HKNG. Hen-ce, in order to find the disturbing force of the sun on the ellipse HKNG, instead of a, in the expression a x x at-e2 x X we are to put a-u , instead of of the Equinoxes. et we are to put a x al-dz, and instead of X we are to put a2-O d mut a-2X. These substitutions being made, we have x x a a 4al-el2 a-_uz x a -u x a X -for the sun's disturbing force on the ellipse HKNG, tending to turn the ellipse about an axis passing through C( and perpendicular to the plane PELQ. This expression for the force being multiplied by z?, gives the fluxion of the force on that part of the spheroid between the ellipses PELQ, H]KNG; and the fluent of this, when u bed mu az-e% 8a3 comes equal to a is a X T x a% x 5X. Consequently the double of this, ViZ. d x mn x aW-em x 4a X expresses the sur's I a~~~~~~~~I disturbing force on the whole spheroid. Hence if Z Q La X 3 which expresses the solid content of the spheroid, the force on the whole spheroid is d x ti x as-en x Z. Let this be called a 5 the librating force or pressure, or the force causing libration. 17. It is evident, from the manner in which the librating pressure is calculated, that the whole of the disturbing force is occasioned by the protuberance of the spheroid above the greatest inscribed sphere. For if PELQ were a sphere, as VI (Fig. 7.) is parallel to the diameter DF, and AC perpendicular to it, the straight line VI (3. III-) would be bisected in R; and therefore the disturbing forces, above and below AC would exactly counteract one another. Let DCF (Fig. 9.) denote a plane perpendicular to the straight line SC, then it is evident that the librating pressure tends to move the earth about that diameter of the equator, which is the common section of the equator and the plane DCE. For the sake of precision hereafter let this diameter oXf the equator be called the axis of Vibration MDcCCVIJ. L 74 Mr. ROBERTSON on the Precession The point E of the equator, nearest the sun, is at the distance of a quadrant from either extremity of the axis of libration. For, by hypothesis, SC is at right angles to the plane DCF, and therefore the axis of libration, which is in this plane, is at right angles to SC. Again as PC the axis of the earth is at right angles to the plane of the . equator, the axis of libration, which is also in the equator, is at right angles to CP. The axis of libration, therefore, being at right angles to Cs, CP in the plane PELQ, is at right angles to CE in the same plane. 18. Let ADDE (Fig. io.) be an oblate spheroid of which AB is the transverse axis, DIE the conjugate axis, and C the centre. Let AKMBLH be the equator of this spheroid and consequently at right angles to ADBE the generating ellipse. Let the spheroid, be cut through DCE by a plane DMEL. at right angles to ADBE, and let MCL be its common section with the equator. Then (19. XI.) MCL is at right angles: to ADBE, and therefore ACM is a right angle; and as -ACD is a right angle, AC is at right angles to the plane DMEL, and consequently at right angles to any plane parallel to it. Let the spheroid be cut by a plane parallel to :DMEL, and let the common section of this plane with the spheroid be the ellipse FKGII.Let this ellipse cut the plane ADBE in the straight line FrG, and the plane of the equator in KrH, the point r being the centre of this last formed ellipse, or that point in which it meets AB. Then, by a well known property of the spheroid, the ellipses DMEL, FKGH are similar, and the area of the first is to that of the other as CAl or its equal CM* to rKt. Put a -AC or CM, e = DC, x = Cr, and the force of each particle in the spheroid being as its distance from the of the Equinoxes. 75 plane DMEL, let v be the force of a particle at A.Let p = the area of a circle whose diameter is i. Then 4zp6 the area of the ellipse DMEL, and as a + x x a ax-X1 rK, A': at-x2:: 4pae: t x M-X = the area of the ellipse FIKGH. Again, v: x: : v the force of a particle at r; a and therefore t x a x--x' = the force of all the particles in the ellipse" FKGrH. Nowas this force acts at r, by the ,property of the lever, the power of the ellipse FKGHJ, to turn the spheroid, either about DE or -ML as an axis, is __ X a1 x2-?; and the fluxion of this force is X a2 X2XX4X. The fluent of this, when x becomes equal to a, is 8L5v and the double of thi.s, for the force of the whole spheriod, is i6pla3 ev Hence it is evident that if the force of each particle in the spheroid, to cause a revolution, be as its distance from the plane DMEL, the particles on one side of this plane having a tendency to cause a revolution in one direction, and the particles on the other side of the plane having an equal tendency to cause a revolution in the same direction, then the pressure with which the spheroid is urged to revolve, either about DE or ML, is as L.J This force is equal to av Z, if Z be put '5 5 equal to i6t3 e, the solid content of the spheroid. 3 d mn 2 2 19. As .the librating force d x T x a-e X Z, ascertained in article 16, and the force a Z, obtained in the last article, are calculated on the same hypothesis, viz. that the force of a particle is as its distance from the plane DCF in Fig. 9, or the plane DMEL in Fig. lo, if they produce equal angular velo,. cities, the spheroids in the two figures being equal in every L 2 76 Mr. ROBERTSO.Non the Precession respect, and all other circumstances being the same, the forces themselves must be. equal. Now at either of the equinoxes the other circumstances are exactly the same in the two figurese At the vernal equinox, for instance, the straight line SACB in Fig. 9. must be in the plane of the equator, and therefore the plane DCF, perpendicular to AB, at this time must pass through the poles P. L. At the equinox, therefore, the straight line SACB, and the plane DCF in Fig. g. are justly represented by ACB, and DMEL in Fig. lo. Hence the librating force x a -e' x Z at the commencement of its action, at the equinox, applies to Fig. ic, and at its commencement it is equally efficacious to cause revolution about DE or ML. We are therefore enabled to compare the effect of the librating force, or, the revolution it is capable of producing, at the equinox, about ML, with the diurnal revolution of the earth about DE, in the following manner. It being admitted that each of the two forces stated in the beginning of the article, produces the same angular velocity, then ad x-innxaire~ =aS Z, and therefore d x mn x a _e v. a 5 5V But if a constant force act for a given time i, and cause the body to move on which it acts, the velocity generated from the commencement of the motion is as the force. Consequently, as v denotes the force acting on a particle at A, during the given time i, and is the forces acting on the other particles of the spheroid are proportional to their distances from the plane DMEL; the angular velocity of A, acquired in the given time I, is also accurately expressed by v. If therefore the force Z Z cease to act at the end of the given time t, the point A, as the spheroid is in free space, will afterwards revolve of the Equinoxes. 77 with the uniform angularvelocity v; but by the doctrine of constant forces, the: angle described by A, during the action rav d a2. el of -FZ IS equal to 7=X 7mn x20. Let AB (Fig. 6.) represent that diameter of the equator' about which the librating force begins to cause revolution at the equinox.. Let G be the centre of the earth, and in GB let GV be taken equal to v , or X n x e Let w denote the angular diurnal velocity of the earth about its axis DC: and in GC let GW be taken equal to w. The points V, XV being joined, let TGS be drawn parallel to VW, and by article Gi TS is the axis about which the earth will now revolve, in consequence of the diurnal revolution being combined with the libration about AD. From T, a pole of this axis, let TK be drawn perpendicular to DG. Then by article 9 GW : GV:: GK: KT. But as the angle DGT is. extremely small, GK may be considered as equal to the radius, and the arc DT as equal to its sine. Consequently, using the notation alreadyd _ specified, anda considering a as radius, w: x mn x --: a: ad a_ X Mn X e=_ the angular velocity caused by the librating force. Our next object is to find the value of d in known terms. 21. If t be put for the time of the earth's diurnal: revolution round its axis,, and T be put for the earth's annual revolution 2 round the sun, then is equal to the centripetal force on a body revolving at the equator in the time t, with the velocity M~~~ w; and, using the notation of article 11, M is equal to the centripetal force of the sun onr the earth.

But, by article ii, the disk turbing force of the sun on a particle at G (Fig. 7.) is equal to 3Mx G-I; and at the distance a from DF the disturbing force 3Mxa fr is The foregoing value of M being substituted for it in this expression, we have 3W" Xt =d, the sun's disturbing force at the distance a from DF. 'This value of d being put for it in the expression at the .end of the last article, it follows that the angular velocity of libration, at its commencement at the equinox, is to the uni3W X 1" 2 form angular diurnal velocity as TIX mu x alle to w, or as 3 mun X a It to 1.

But as the product mn is the only variable quantity which enters into the value of the librating force, obtained in article 16, it is evident that 360 x x X mu x expresses the momentary angular velocity of Vibration at any time. We are now to consider this effect of the librating force in the direction in which the force is exerted, viz. in a meridian analogous to PEAQ in Figure 7. 22. Let FLGA (Fig. ii.) represent the ecliptic on the sphere, S the sun's place in it, L the first point of Libra and A that of Aries; LBA the position of the equator when the sun is at S, and SB the sun's declination. Let FBG be the position into which the equator is pressed in the time t, by a combination of the librating force and the diurnal of the Equinoxes. 79 revolution; or, which comes to the same, let the spherical angle FBL or ABG be equal to 60 X X mu x aX a,! e Let h 211 ~~a 4 a~e Then by'spherical Trigonometry, sin.

If FG be bisected in C, and the arc CE be perpendi-. cular to FG, meeting LBA in E, and FBG in D; then the arc CD is the measure of the angle at F. Also, as FL is extremely small, CE may be taken for the measure of the angle at L. Hence as BIDE is a right angle, radius : sin. BE or cos. BL:: sin. EBD-: sin. ED. Consequently as ED is extremely 3t t Cos. BL small, 36o x xlihmn x radiu ED, the momentary nutation, or the momentary change in the inclination of the equator to the ecliptic.

The obliquity of theecliptic has been assumed as equal to 230 27' 45", such being its ma nitude , very nearly, at the beginning of the year l8o7. From the general expression 6-o x Y Xb obtained in article 94, it is evident, that when the sun is in either of the equinoctial points, the nutation becomes equal to o. Supposing therefore the earth to be subject to -noother disturbing force than that of the sun, at each of the equinoxes the earth's diurnal revolution is made about its axis of figure, as PL in Fig. 9; but as at other times the disturbing force tends to cause a libration about a diameter Of the equator, it is ev-ident from article lo, that the axis about which it revolves deviates, by a quantity extremnelysmall, from its axis of figure. A similar deviation, of the axis of revolution from the axis of figure, is produced by the action of the moon; but a minute examination of these deviations is foreign to the present design. As the foregoing articles: extend beyond the supposed difficulty in the subject, it is deemed unnecessary either to add to their number, or to lengthen this Paper by such additional remarks, as may be met with in every respectable publication on Physical Astronomy. -~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~/s v G I /~~~~~~~~~~~~Ji/.
