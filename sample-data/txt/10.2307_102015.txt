(970) V. An Abstract of a Letter sent from Mr. Samuel Dale to Mr. John Houghton, S. R. S. concerning the making of Turnep-Bread in Essex. S I R, T H E dearness of all sorts of Corn hath occasioned many poor People to set their Wits, as it were, on Tenter-hooks, and to try many ways and methods of making Bread for the Sustenance of their Families, as in some places, of Pease, and frequently of Barley: so with us they have lately got a way of making it with Turneps, which not only for the novelty thereof, but also because it may be of general use and benefit to poor, mean and indigent people, I will beg your patience until I acquaint you with the way and manner of making it, which is this: They take pilled Turneps, and boyl them in Water until they are soft or tender; then pressing strongly out the Juice, they mix them, being beaten or pounded very fine and small, with their weight of Wheat-Meal. Then adding Salt q. s. and warm Water, they ~ it up as other Dough,or Paste,which having lain a little while to ferment, they order it, and bake it as common Bread. Of this Turnep-Bread (for so they call it) I have both seen and tasted, and can assure you, that to the Eye it's not to be distinguisht from common Wheaten or Houshold Bread, neither doth the Scent much betray it, especially when cold; only to dainty and nice Palates the Turneps are a little, and but a little, perceived.
