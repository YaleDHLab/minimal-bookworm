[766] A discourse concerning the effects of the great Frost, on Trees and other Plants Anno 1683. drawn from the answers to some Queries sent into divers Countries by Dr. Rob. Plot S.R.S. and from several Observations made at Oxford, by the skilful Botanist Mr. Jacob Bobart. THE Cold now approaching and threatning, easily puts us in mind of the rigour and severity of the last unparallel'd Winter; wherein Men, Beasts, Vegetables, and most part of what had any life in it, felt its cruel assaults: some proving able to withstand, and other forced to suffer under it's so unusual and rude a season; which extream cold and frost happening in our time, gave occasion of taking notice of some of it's extraordinary effects, which to ennumerate in the several parts of the Creation, and discourse of each subject and what operation it had upon each part thereof, might rather employ a large Volume, then a discourse, the present intention being only to give some relation of its working among Vegetables, and to incite others for the future to the consideration of the procedure of the cold, and how it operates upon such bodyes, that thereby we may, being fore-warned, be in some measure prepared for the better preservation and defence of many things in that nature in other winters, the mildest and best whereof, proves troublesome to many Plants, though in the general it does kindness to the Earth, and it's future product. In this rigid season nothing seemed more surprizing to us, nor more generally known to be true, then the cleaving or splitting of Trees in the time of the hard Frost: To endeavour therefore for what satisfaction could be obtained in this particular the Learned Dr. Plot sent these Queries following to several Persons of Quality [767] Quality living in different parts of the Nation, desiring their opinions and answers, that by comparison, some judgment might be made of so unusual destructive and unwelcome a matter, which especially bent its force against Oakes, as a stout enemy assaulting the strongest fort. 1. Whether other Trees were split besides Oakes? 2. Whether any did split with a noise? 3. Whether all Trees did split towards the same point of the compass? 4. Whether the splitting were more common in the trunke or in the boughs? 5. Whether any Ice were found since in any of the Vessels of the Wood? 6. Whether the Trees split, be any of them dead? 7. Whether any of the Trees split have closed since? 8. Whether they are split Through, or only on one side? 9. Whether the barke by splitting be loosened from the wood? 10. Whether the roots have been any wayes affected as well as the Bodies of the Trees? In answer to the first of these, 'tis too well known that other Timber-trees besides Oakes were also cleft, as Elmes by Mr. Langley's house the Minister of Tamworth, and Ashes of considerable bulk and value, designed for, and capable of diverse uses, as Windmill-posts, Dresserboards, and other necessary occasions. Also Walnut-trees in diverse places have suffered by this calamity, and proved extreamly cleft; tho indeed it hath been most frequent among Oakes, many of which have been divided to great detriment in England, some being so rent that a man may see through them, and that many times the Cracks came with so great noise (which may answer the 2d Querie) that as it is related from Needwood Forrest they made such a noise, that the Keepers there thought that the Deer were shot by the people of Z the [768] the Country, and that in several parts they were heard as loud as Guns, some having been cruelly affrighted, especially in the Evenings or Nights as they have passed within the hearing of this so unexpected and surprizing a noise. Which rifts or clefts were (as in answer to the third Querie) not only to the same point of the Compass, but sometimes on one side only, sometimes 2 and sometimes 3 and sometimes 4 several places, dividing or quartering the Tree, and sometimes quite through (as the eighth Querie seems to examine:) and these clefts not only in the bodies, but continued into the larger boughs and limbs of the Tree, in answer to the forth Querie, and sometimes descended into the superficial roots, answering to the I oth Querie, but not to those very deep in the Earth, the Frost though extream, not reaching considerably deep comparatively to the roots of Trees, and the hard binding of the Earth being so frozen would not easily admit of compressure, but several shallow roots so knotted and knurled not to be wrought upon with betle and wedges, are known to be cleft by the frost: But it is much to be doubted and suspected whether any such cloven trees were so perfectly sound and faithful Timber, if proved by the Saw and Axe, as they ought to be; for if so, all might equally suffer, the Air having impartial access to one as well as the other, but some being taken with this disease and other left untouch't, there certainly was some cause or defect in these liable to it, rather then the rest. What it was that might give occasion to some only, might prove a matter worthy of enquiry. A great part of the cause is supposed to be imperfection in such a Tree, and that generally from the too large sap-vessels and unnatural cavities therein, which some call Wind shaken, and some Lag d-trees, the cause whereof remains yet to be examined, whether the shaking of the Wind may not, with its great weight and force, taking the whole Tree with its boughs limbs and [769] and body, having one end firmly fixed in the Earth, at some age or other, as well work wrack and make splintering and stretched pores, passages, cavities and such like in a live and growing Tree, at some time of continuance of its force with its oft repeated beating, twisting, and pressing blasts; as well as the best chosen Mast of a Ship may suffer dammage by the same cause, even to total fraction. By some this is supposed to proceed from Earthquakes, but whether or not, is yet to be examined. But the opinion of some seems not to be extravagant who think it to be an original distemper in the Tree, and to proceed from the soil, or rather an innate disease from some tho undiscernable imperfection in the seed it self, and yet not so much but that they live many years, and grow to great bulk and stature, but are observed to bear lesser leaves and smaller Acornes, but whether the soil be concern'd may be urged? the Trees about Oxford Westward, being generally affected with this disease, and those from the East side prove excellent sound Timber, and the soiles seeming to resemble one another. But by what means soever this may come, it is certain that some Trees are much more sound then other, and that some prove full of inbred diseases and cavities, before they are cut down, which cavities and stretcht vessels being fill'd with too great a quantity of aqueous and undigested sap, as it were Hydropical (for it is thought that the genuine and natural sap of these our native Trees though undergoing condensation will remain secure and safe, as may be supposed from those that are well and firmly standing) are thereby rendred capable of not only condensation but glaciation also by the continuance and severity of the Aires frigefactive power; which being sufficiently known to employ more room being Ice than when formerly liquid, might probably cause these breaches, and if we consider the expansive motion and spring of the Aire included in the Z 2 cavities [770] cavities of the air vessel, suffering more pressure than they are patient of, from the coagulated and contiguous aqueou parts then congealed, may be induced to suppose these strepitous eruptions to proceed from thence. Bnt whether Mr. Hobb s Hypothesis will certainly hold, that the swelling is caused by the intrusion of the Air, is somewhat to be doubted. It need not prove troublesome to any to think the air to be able to tear the Oakes or other Trees, who shall consider the great force and elastick power thereof, whereof that most excellent and Curious Philosopher of our age Esq; Boyle hath in his History of Cold setforth several Experiments and Examples, as Vessels of several kinds of Mettals, being made strong on purpose and fill'd with water close stopped and exposed to the Cold, which being not capable of withstanding the expansive force of the inclosed Ice, have been found cleft and broken; as for instance a strong Barrel of a Gun close stopped, with water in it, and frozen, hath prov'd rent longwaies, and never a cross the Vessel, nor bodies of the trees we here mention: Another time a brass-vessel of a Cylindriacal form being made not more then 5 inches deep and not 2 diameter fill'd with Water and afterwards frozen, in one night lifted off the cover prepared and closely fitted, with a weight of 56 pounds that was laid upon it. Olearius, Secretary to the Duke of Holsteins Embassy into Russia, tells us that in the City of Mosco he observed (the cold being very intense) the Earth to be cleft many yards in length and a foot broad, which according to conjecture was occasioned by the heaving and swelling thereof to enlarge its roome, as here we see Ice crackt and cleft considerably long and broad according to its thickness along the ridge or turgid part thereof. And that the earth doth so rise when frozen is easily made manifest by little sticks or plants set into the ground against the approaching Winter, which being risen 2 or 3 inches [771] inches or more according to the depth and strength of the frost, and upon the thaw the Earth sinking to its former station leaves the unfixed Plants with their roots naked above ground, as it were spewed out. And not such moist bodies only, but Metals, as Brass, Iron, &c. have been swelled in the time of being frozen, as hath been proved by Clocks, Locks and other Instruments, and become laxed and plyant again upon the Thaw. Many more examples might be easily produced to induce us to the thoughts that the sap is not right and genuine in such ill disposed Trees, and that Ice might upon due examination be found in any such bursten bodies, as we are informed hath been found and observed by some, which may prove somewhat in answer to the 5th Querie: and if Ice, then pressure, and if pressure, then breaking and explosion. It may be doubted too, whether some of these Trees thus liable to the fury of the Frost have not been Coltie? a term commonly used among Timber-Merchants and by them avoided, which is towards the middle of the Tree, among the Annual Circles some one is much larger then the rest and the Sap Vessels there seem much extended beyond their fellows, and upon cleaving or sawing such a Tree, that inclosed or inward heart, part thereof where that Circle is, will slip and drop from the other part oftentimes without any force to divide it, as an Instrument out of a Case or Mould made fit for it. Some suppose that these Wind-shaken or Lagd-trees may be known or neerly guessed at by the outside when growing by the great Ribbs, 2, 3, or 4 in a Tree from the bottom to the branches, and that they have been affected somewhat considerably with this disease before, and perhaps cleft (tho not in so great a measure as now) and the fissures closed up again, as we see these to do quickly after the Frost, insomuch that it is scarce discernable already, and in answer to the 9th Querie, the [772] the barke having not been divided from the body, upon coming together again each turn and twist of the grain fitting its place prove fresh and vigorously growing, which may satisfie the 6th and 7th Queries, but that ever such Trees will prove whole and found doth scarcely consist with reason or our present thoughts. And this Calamity hath not been found in only Trees that were fresh and standing, but also in Trees cut down, as is affirmed by Mr. Shish the Master-builder in his Majesties Ship-yard at De~ford, and from divers others, but notwithstanding it is thought to be only among such diseased Trees as are before mentioned. But it is yet to be questioned whether Vines have proved cleft and crackt along the bodies by the same way and reason as Timber-trees, which decay is especially to be seen on Walls exposed to the Southern aspect, so that the Sun our accustomed Friend, now proved our great enemy, by thawing and relaxing the Sap every day, and then being frozen and made stiff again every night, which often repetition of bending and unbending, softening and hardening the vivid spirituous Juice being destroied, and Day and Night the drought vigorously acting, (the Sap being this Year disordered and surprized, not gradually seasoned, even before Michaelmas day, and the fresh Sap to supply its defects being wholly deteined from arising, there then being none or very little exhalations or evaporations arising out of the frozen and bound Earth) these poor slender bodies fill'd only with thin and not viscous Sap, have proved as great sufferers as if by amputation they had been deprived of their natural sustenance; for if they could have none from the Earth, and their own true juice mortified, and it be certain that omne siccum appetit humidum, it will follow that such branches will by the constancy and continuance of sueh severity (the Day being as bad as the Night) prove as dry as sticks cut off long before: whereas [773] as those of this kind and other sorts also growing in more shadowie parts and undergoing but one change have remained in good condition, especially among Red Grapes, which seem much more hardy then White ones. We see other Wall-fruits on the same position as Apricocks, Peaches, Plums, Cherryes, &c. not at all injur'd or prejudiced by the weather, which are of a more clammy viscous juice: These we see run sometimes and give gum; but the Leakage of Vines is as thin as Water, which different Juices and Saps in other Trees and the degrees thereof, as well those with deciduous leaves as evergreenes, may prove some cause of the weakness and decay of some, whilst that of another sort standing by remains fresh and vigorous, only stagnated, sedate, and quiet, waiting for the benign Suns beames to actuate, lenifie, and put its spirits in motion, and its comfortable refreshment to arise in due season; And perhaps according to the degtee of this qualification in Trees and Plants (some being much more sluggish then other) may be the cause of their earlier or later germination. But to rightly examine and consider the several and distinct Juices of Trees, every one certainly differing from each other, and the alteration so easily made by what salts or spirit each rejoices in, and their several commixtures, and the many Coates, Passages, Streyners, Vessels, and the different procedure of each, would prove a large task, though much facilitated by the Learned Malpighius, whose great curiosity hath been shewed on this subject. It is easily observed that in dry, Mountainous, Rocky, and barren Plantations, where Trees, Greens, and other Plants having been sparingly fed, and not pampered with such Luxuriance and freeness of Sap, as in the Valleyes,and richer Soils; have escaped tolerably well,and by this which in other Years proves their poverty and disease, now make them insult over those growing in the fatter Valleys proportional to the height of the Hills they grow on. We [774] We may observe Trees all the Winter while the sap remains condensed to be safe and well, but if a flattering too early glance happens in the Spring to set their parts in action, and the juices to become fluid, and a sudden mutation of that marmth to a fresh return of Winter, (which too frequently happens in England) that then we have not only out hopes of that years fruits blasted, but even the passages in the branches and boughs stopped, and the crude sap settleing commonly called bliting (tho there be many causes of the effects which go under that notion) becomes a disease in Trees equal to that of Child-blanes in juvenile blood, which sometimes takes whole trees, and sometimes branches only; Hence is supposed the decay of the Glastenbury Thorne, whose arising time being between Michaelmas and Christmas being sappily prepared by the beginning of the hard Frost, which hath almost affrighted it out of its life. Some Trees and Shrubs seem to have their Vessels and passages so streightened and as it were shrunk with cold, that they appear equal to a human body sinew-shrunk or paralytick, that is not without much trouble able to move or bear his decaying limbs; Thus we see Trees with their barke schriveled, with their passages half stopt, whose sap now only squeezing and difficultly passing, hath much ado to force its way through the dryed and narrow pores and passages of the body and branches, and sometimes this distemper is so prevalent that whole branches of a Tree are kill'd when the other part is indifferent well. Some Liquids such as Essential Oyles do rather shrink than encrease being frozen,and Empereumatical Oyles will hardly freeze but wast, which considerations may introduce the thoughts of what some Trees are made of, or do abound in, as Firrs, Pines, &c. which are capable of enduring the cold of Norway and other Countries. These and many other such considerations here, but some [775] some whereof hinted, may require and deserve farther and more particular examination and improvement, but at present having mentioned these things in general some or other hereof may perhaps suit with, and prove applicable to some or other of these particulars hereafter to be mentioned. What Timber-trees have suffered, are above specified, but diverse other of our native Trees and Shrubs have scarcely proved able to withstand the force of so rude an enemy. Yew and Holly (things whose tenderness was never suspected) were in some places quite kill d, and in many places so discouraged loosing their leaves, and blemishing the bark,that it is to be feared they will never take on their pristine Splendour and Verdure. The Furze in many places quite kill'd, and in most places cut down and spring again, but often the resurrection in vain expected; Common Broome proves a degree hardier; In some places the Sunny side of a Juniper bush proves scorch't between Sun and Cold, but that proves one of the most hardy of our native Greens; so that it is hard to say what is Winter-proofe, even among our Natives, except Box and Ivy which stand in defiance of all. And after this to look into the Gardens (which generally are Nurseries of Exoticks, and from warm Countries) and to think how great destruction hath there happened is directly renovare dolores, and this Calamity taking off the especial beauty thereof hath principally bent its force against Winter-greenes, such as Alaternus (commonly known by the name of Phillurea) and the true Phillurea also, which are generally kill'd, though some upon cutting down spring again. Also common Bayes seen in most places to be kill'd down, and Lawrell seldom proving impatient, is in some places kill'd, in some places half dead; Rosmary, Laurustine, Halimus, Arbutus, White Jasmine, and other which seldom fail, are generally kill'd through the whole Country. But of A all [786] all these and other such like, in Mountainous and dry places (as was before observed) there is brisk life and verdure yet remaining though rarely to be met with, but however enough to retain the several species among us. But if for the future in such times of extremity the superficies of the Ground, and bodyes of such things here recited and Fig-trees, were well covered with strawy matter to keep off the Frost, it might so preserve them as to spring out plentifully the Spring following, though their whole tops being too large and high, and thereby incapable of such covering, might loose their present leaves and beauty, which might from such respringing be easily repaired, and prove much more satisfactory, then to begin the world a new, as we are generally forc't to do for Cypresses, which were us'd to be excellent Ornaments both in Summer and Winter, now it proving a very rare thing to see one well alive; In some places there appears some lingering life, but scarcely sufficient to recover the whole, but in most places are quite dead, that have faced 40, 50, or 60 Winters before; After some Winters they appear somewhat scorch't and russet, upon which Esq; Evelyn directs the beating and thrashing them with a good tough Hazle wand, or such like, to ease them of their dead leafy parts, and admit the refreshing Air to the inward parts and branches, but this year their disease is beyond the power of such a remedy, but from Seed they will within few years be repaired. Also among those with deciduous leaves, divers have been sufferers, as Arbor-Judae, young Plane trees, though those of considerable stature have pretty well escaped, Paliurus, The Aleppo Ash, in some places the Locust Tree, and in most hedges the great common Bramble, and some other, which upon cutting do some or most of them spring again. But such Greens also as we receive from, and are the glory [787] glory of warmer Countries, and very rare, curious and pleasant with us, such as Oranges, Lemons, Myrtles, Pomegranates, the perfuming Jasmines, and divers other rarities which are usually kept in Pots and Cases for the convenience of removing them into Green-houses and conservatories, not being able to endure our milder winters, have in many places extreamly suffered, especially in houses of weaker defence, but where the skill, care and due management of their Keepers have met with the convenience of good warm Houses, with keeping constant fires (which is a matter to be regulated with great discretion) according to the proportion of which combining qualifications, the Plants have escaped, as in some places most of them are well, in some places half, and in some places all dead; but with additional care and secure keeping, as the enemy encreaseth, they even the most tender are to be kept and produced in the spring to our great satisfaction and pleasure. But indeed in the Spring, being flattered with some warme glances and refreshing daies, to the great danger, many are apt to expose their choise greens, which upon a suddain change to its former Cold, with sharp Eastern winds, proves more pernicious to such strangers as well abroad as out of houses, then all the former Winter, and seems to finish the destruction of what the former Cold hath spared, a matter too frequently seen among us, we enjoying no certain steady Summer till after the solstice; But these tender Exoticks loosing their leaves having received detriment, with their tops schriveled and the like, are oftentimes not capable of enduring the interposing scorching heat of the Sun, which sometimes happens by fits in the Spring, when the prudence and care of the Gardener is especially tried, gradually to help and recover his sick Patients, sometimes by due trimming, earthing with fresh sustenance, loosening the straite bound earth, and sometimes with the help of a warm bed, and A 2 gent [778] gentle watering and shadowing and the like, patiently and carefully waiting till the return of the bounty of the Heavens to help his endeavors. Among Plants, Herbs, and Flowers, there hath been great destruction also, and many of common use, as most of the Artichokes of England, and winter Coleflowers, Sage, Tyme, Mastick, Lavender, Laven-Cotton, and divers other were generally kill'd, except such as happened to be new planted that year, and so low that they had the enjoyment of the kind covering of a little Snow, which proves the most natural, feeding, and warm covering, of any thing to be mentioned; but what peeped its head above it seemed in great danger of being kill'd; And as we may see in the Corn-fields, that those sides of the Lands of Corn facing the South where the Snow was melted and the Corn deprived of its covering, the want proved deadly, and in many places Husbandmen were forced to begin again in the Spring to plough and sow other Grain; which may easily teach us rather to heap Snow upon our Herbs, and Flowers, then fancy it a cold unkind enemy. But in the Flower-Garden especial observance ought to be taken that the Choiser Roots of the Asian Ranunculi, Aulmoneys, Tender Narcissi and divers other of the like tenderness and strangers to such entertainments as Our Northern Countries afford, that if hard Frost should happen upon the Than and melting of such covering, should be securely covered and kept from the Frost if possible, till the too frigid moisture of the I arth be digested, which would prove pernicious even to the death and rottenness of many such Roots and Plants. But after all this repetition of sorrows we are to comfort our selves that such destruction and calamity happens but very rarely, the like having not been known in the memory of man, if ever before; And that with due care and observance the growing cold might be kept off from such things as are proved to be impatient of it; which are ] 779] are not all Greens in our Gardens, some being able to endure all the cold that ever came, as Firrs, Pines of divers forts, Cedars of Libanus and Virginia, (though that of Barmoodes proves tender) Arbor vitae, all the Savius, whereof the upright or Berry-bearing, is the best Succedaneum to Cypress, capable of finer cutting into Pyramids or other figures, or hedges, 6 or 8 foot high, and is one of the best of the Tonsile Shrubs; also the Pyracantha proves exceeding hardy, and makes good hedges. Divers others might be mentioned, and with additional care to help the weaker, some whereof are formerly spoken of, which perhaps may not feel such severity in our time nor many years after, we may not prove so pusilanimous as to be discouraged, but remain satisfied with the hopes that we may enjoy the pleasure and refreshing satisfaction in Gardens as heretofore. 3.
