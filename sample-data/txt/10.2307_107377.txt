XXIII. An essay towards the calculus of functions. By C. Babbage, Esq. Communicated by WV. H. Wollaston, M. D. Sec. R. S. Read June 15, i81X;. T HE term function has long been introduced into analysis with great advantage, for the purpose of designating the result of every operation that can be performed on quantity. This extent of signification has rendered it of essential use, but the various applications of which it admits, and the questions to which it gives rise, do not appear to have met with sufficient attention. I propose in the following paper to present an outline of a new calculus, which naturally results from it. It comprehends questions of the greatest generality and difficulty, and will probably require the invention of new methods for its improvement. Many of the calculations with which we are familiar, consist of two parts, a direct, and an inverse; thus, when we consider an exponent of a quantity: to raise any number to a given power, is the direct operation: to extract a given root of any number, is the inverse method. The differential calculus, which is a direct method, naturally gave rise to the integral, which is its inverse: the same remark is applicable to finite differences. In all these cases the inverse method is by far the most difficult, and it might perhaps be added, the most useful. 3o Mr. BABBAGE'S essay towards It is this inverse method with respect to functions, which I at present propose to consider. If an unknown quantity as x, be given by means of an equaation, it becomes a question how to determine its value; simic larly if an unknown function as 4', be given by means of any functional equation, it is required to assign its form. In the first case, it is quantity which is to be determined; inthesecond it is the form assumed by quantity, that becomes the subject of investigation. In the one case, the various powers of the unknown quantity enter into the equation; in the other, the different orders of the function are concerned. Before I proceed, it will be proper to explain the meaning of the order of a functional equation, and likewise to indicate the notation made use of; -, A, &c. are known functional characteristics; go X, 4A, are unknown ones. If in any function as 4x, instead of -x, the original function be substituted, it becomes 4 4 x or 42x: this is called the second finction of x} If the process be repeated, the result is NV 4Ax or X x, the third function of x; and similarly iV x, denotes the ntb function of x. Suppose Ax .. a + x then Vx x=a+a+x-2a+x and generally X x na + x A functional equation is said to be of the first order, when it contains only the first function of the unknown quantity ; as, for Instance, 4,ax +4 x 4-x x= o (4x+ 4,?' ~ ax + X2=No..M the calculus of fnctions. 391 If the second function enter, the equation rises to -the second order: thus, A(X + X) + (X ..-X)2 =o (4+ -2x~ X) =ax A function of two variables admits of two second functions: thus 4 (xy) becomes4l (I (x, y), y), and + (x, 4 (x, y)) or they might be thus expressed 4,I (xby) and 4'," (xZy). These express the second functions;, the first taken relative to x, the other relative to y. But besides these two there is another, which arises from taking the second function simultaneously relative to x, and y; it is 4{ (4, x,y), 4, (xy) }. This ought not to be written 4-2i2 (x, y) for it is not the second function first taken relative to x and then to y, nor is it the converse of this. In fact, the notation is defective ; some method is wanting of indicating the order in which the successive substitutions are made. I shall for the present lay aside the consideration of functional equatiGns, involving more than one variable. Those of the first order have long been known, but the method in which I have treated them, is, I believe, entirely new. Equations of the second and higher orders have never been even mentioned; it is these which present the most interesting speculations, and which are involved in the greatest difficulties. I shall first give some account of the enquiries which led me to this subject, and shall then treat of the varis ous orders of functional equations. Some few years since, while considering a problem mentioned by PAPPUs, relating -to the inscription of a number 390 Mr. BABBAGE'S essay towards of circles in a semicircle, the following question occurred to me. If in an hyperbola between its assymptotes a circle be in--scribed touching both asymptotes and the curve, and if another circle be inscribed touching the first circle, the curve, and one asymptote, and if this be continued as represented in the figure, what ratio does the area of the circles bear to that of the figure; and conversely, if this ratio is given, what is the nature of the curve ? I soon perceived the great difficulty of the subject, and that these and other problems similar to the latter of them, required the application of methods totally different from any with which I was then acquainted. Hopeless of success, I laid aside the subject until about two years after, when the same difficulty recurred under another form. I had proposed to myself the following problem: What must be the nature of the curve ABC, such that if C ,4 G ~ P D X any point C be taken, and the ordinate CD, thef' normal CE, and subnormal DE be drawn, and if the triangle CDE be turned into such a position that CD may become the base and DE the perpendicular, if DE coincide with some new ordinate as GB, then the norinal CE at the first point shall coincide with the normal BF at the second? the calculus offunctzons. 393 This latter question, of far less difficulty than the former, was readily solved, but I did not at first observe that they rested on similar principles; this, however, was pointed out by Mr. HERSCHEL, to whom I had mentioned the subject. Such was the origin of the following enquiries. The question, in its most general point of view, is the solution of functional equations of all orders. This, however, is a generality which I do not pretend to have attained. In the first part of this Paper the reader will find a new method of solving all functional equations of the first order; it depends on possessing their particular solutions. In the subsequent part, I have given various methods of solving functional equations of the second and higher orders: some of these possess considerable generality ; and if we consider only those in which the nt6 and inferior orders enter simply, such as F { 4x, 4,2 x,. 4 }n I have pointed out the means of obtaining their solutions. The determination of functions from given conditions most probably took its rise from the integration of equations of partial di erentials; and we accordingly finld that the authors of this calculus were soon engaged in the new problem to which it gave birth. D'ALEMJBEPT was the first who occupied him-. self with this subject: he was soon followed by EULER and LAGRANGE ; but it is to MONGE that 'we are indebted for the most general view of the subject. His enquiries were directed to the determination of two functions from given conditions; they are contained in the fifth volume of the Melanges de Turin, and in two Papers in the seventh volume of the Met moires des Savans Etrangers, 1773. MDCCCXV. 3 E S3942 ~Mr. BABDAGE's essay towards In the first of these he explains the solution of several functional equations by means of curves of double curvature, and by curve surfaces. In the second Paper, the question is treated in a more anal lytical method, and he endeavours to reduce it to the solution of equations of differences. "J Je me propose," observes MONGE, "de faire voir que la determination des fonctions arbitraires qui se trouvent dans 1' in tegrale d'une equation aux differences partielles, depend en general, dans les cas que je n'ai pas encore trait6s, de lintegrale d'une ou de plusieurs equations aux differences finies, dans lesquelles le rapport de la variable principale a sa difference finie est donne' soit qu'il soit variable soit qu'il soit constant." In the same volume is a paper of LAPLACE on this subject, which he views ill the same light, and endeavours to reduce functional equations of the first order to those of finite differences. This skilful analyst first solved the functional equation F {X x,, p ax,} o. The method he made use of is peculiarly elegant ; he converted it into an equation of finite differences in which the difference was constant. Still, however, it appeared by no means the most direct method to make use of such an expedient, nor was it even known that all equations of the first order admitted of its application. This latter objection was, however, removed by Mr. HERSCHEL, who in an excellent paper on functional equations, has extended the method made use of by LAPLACE to the solution of all equations of the first order'. His solution is equally elegant and general; it leaves nothing to be regretted, but the narrow limits of our knowledge respecting the integration of equations of finite differences. From this and other causes, I anm still the calculus offunctions4 9 inclined to think that the solution of functional equations most be sought by methods peculiarly their own, There are some other researches on this difficult subject of which I am unable to give any account, from the possibility of procuring the works in v hich they are contained; among these is the paper of ARBOGAST, which gained the prize of the Academy of Petersburg in the year 1790. For the sake of convenience, I shall call any solution of a functional equation which contains one or more arbitrary functions, a general solution ; but if the solution of such an equation only contains arbitrary constants, I shall call it a particular solution, With respect to the number of arbitrary functions that may enter into any solution, I shall make some observations at the conclusion of this paper. PROBLEM I. Required the general solution of the functional equation, 4, -4' x supposing we are acquainted with one particular solution. Let the particular solution be x Aofa x X then take 4 3 > being an arbitrary function. It is evident that this value of 4, will satisfy the original equation, and that Ofa Pa is identical, becausef =-f a xX Example, let the equation be A,(x) = (x) and the particular solution be f xthe general solution is ,X Cq@(x2) which evidently answers the conditions. 3 E X 396 Mr. BABBAGE'S essay towards As I shall have frequent occasion to make use of symmetrical functions of two or more quantities, I shall for the sake of brevity denote this by putting a line over the functional characteristic; thus p (xay) represents a symmetrical function of x and y, which it is well known possesses the folb lowing property, As we are only considering functional equations of one variable, this will be sufficient for the present purpose; it might perhaps otherwise be more advisable to put the line over the quantities relative to which the function is symmetrical; thus {x, Y, z, v } is symmetrical relative to z and v, but it is not so in respect to the other variables. This would possess the advantage of readily designating a function symmetrical relative to two quantities in one wtay, and likewise symmetrical with respect to two others, but in a different manner,* thus I I 9 { X, Y, v> Z a particular case of this 'is v3z -3_ax Y which is symmetrical in one sense relative to x and y, and in a different sense with respect to v and z; but these belong to other enquiries. PROBLEM I1. Required a general solution of the equation 4 x a X4 having given a particular solution off x =f M x 0 This is not a mere imaginary refinementI have constantly had occasion to make use of functions of many variables which were symimetrical by pairs, when iaestigating the nature of functionral equations of more than ome variable. the calculus offunctions. 7 Assume 4 x = {xsfx } then it becomes ., ~~~~~~~~~I l I this equation will be satisfied if we determinef andf, so that thle following equations may be fulfilled. f a x f = x andfa x f x from these resultfe x =f a x _fx I but we have by hypothesis a particular solution off f x therefore the general solution of 4 x, ' x is If the function a should be of such a nature that x =x, or even if l x -x, f x will then become x. for example, suppose 4, x + ( x -then since iz a.t (a-x . . _ X a -i and we have x-+ {x } a particular case of this is when a = o, -(x) = , (x), its solution is 4,xwz {x x}= x2) the same as in the last Problem; as another example take tw=?

I} if we make y = x + L, it becomes yx _x = , an eqLtation to the hyperbola. PROBLEM III. Required the general solution of 4' x = A x x 4 0 x; having a particular solution, and also one of 4ix = e4' Assume 'x =fx x (p {ffx} 1 2 making this substitution in the original equation, it becomes fx X x tfxfx}=A x xfc xp tfccxfccx } makefa x -zfx, and 1 Z 2 2 I facx =fx, from this it results thatfx =fwcc x of which we posI 2 I I sess a particular solution, divide both sides by p {fxjfa} then we have fx _ Ax xf acx; this is nothing more than the original equation of which, and ofJfr f2x, we have by hypothesis particular solutions: the calculus offunctions. therefore Its general solution is, 4, x =9 f X O{fxJfax The same equation may be solved differently, if we are .acquainted with particular solutions of the equations 4.x x, and+X= Ax x 4 x. Assume 4, x _f x x x, 'it becomes fz~cp=Azxfczxxqzx letfx be the particular solution of the original equation, then fx Ax xfcax, and by division but of this also we have given a particular solution, call itfx, therefore the general expression of 4,x, is %Px =fxX of X. Let us take for example the equation X e 4,x= 4, 2X + Z the particular value of 4 x is fx I + XI and the particular case of 4X, 4 $. is f, from these considerations the general solution is X = ' + X) q t' which will on. trial be found to satisfy the equation.* * Another particular solution of X 'is X-0Cos. log (X_ t) -this gives for the general solution of I-ZX X I +2 400 Mr. BABBAGE's essay towards As another example, take x x the particular solutions are, that of the equation itself fX-I and that of 4 x 4 I is known to be (x ), hence the general solution is which, as is readily seen, fulfills the condition, PROBLEM IV.

III, and we thence obm tain the general solution of the given equation. From this may readily be deduced the solution of the folk lowing equations: 4 ((eY) ? (e-Y) = Ay supposef is a particular solution, take {,y -=fy 4 y, the equation becomes f (y) +-f (-Y) + X (e) ? X (s-)-Ay, but we have from the particular solution f (ay) ?f ( .Y) -Ay: the calculus offunctions. 401 this subtracted from the former, leaves x (el) ? X (e'Y)O Let us first consider the upper sign, then a particular solution of X (eY) = _ ( is X (y) -(log. y)Zfl+I. If we take the lower sign, then a solution of X (EY) ( x 63 is x (y (ogo ) . From these considerations it appears, that the general solutions of the given equations are -Y =-fy + { (log.y)+} and 4y -fy 4 ^ {(log.y)"} according as the upper or under sign is used. The equation Just solved was not constructed as an example to this particular rule, but is selected because it has actually occurred. It is used by Mr. HERSCHIEL in the Philosophical Transactions, 1814, for the purpose of assigning the sums of several very curious series. fie there observes, that when the upper sign is used 2ttL (i +y), and when the lower takes place 2%+ L (i + y, are particular solutions, these may therefore be generalized by the introduction of an arbitrary function If GU-Y +4, e-Y = a rational function ofy containing only even powers, or if, e -4, e-+ a rational function of y containing only odd powers, they admit of the following solutions, in the first case, let a + ay9, + a y4+& ay9, 0 1 2 f lMDCCCXV, F 402 Mr. BABBAGE'S essay t ards assulme 4y=A+A (log.y) +&c.+ A (log.y)tn O I n 4is'becomes A+A+A y4+ &c.+Ay e-'becomesA + Ay +Ayj + &;c. + Ay2 By comparing the coefficients, A-va A=va, &c.

When from a functional equation of the first order, we determine the form of the unknown function, one or more constant quantities are generally introduced; these as I have shown in a preceding Problem, may be changed into arbitrary functions of the unknown quantity which fulfil certain prescribed conditions.', A question naturally arises as to the number of these arbitrary functions, and how many any given equation admits of in its most general solution. The-train of reasoning usually made use of to prove, that a differential equation of the ntb order, requires 'in its complete -integral n, arbitrary constants may be pursued on the present occasion, though from several reasons, it would perhaps be desirable to have a proof resting on a different principle; as I have not been successful in discovering any other, I shall give the only one I am at present possessed of.

I 2 X But this is too hasty a conclusion, for it is evident, that we should equally have arrived at equation (A), if each of the constant quantities in (o) habd been changed into a function of x so constituted that it should not alter by the substitution of ax, gX, &C. vX, It would now appear, that putting such values for the cons stant quantities, the result would be the general solution of (A). This reasoning is certainly plausible, and such a solution is undoubtedly a very general one; still, however, there are reasons which incline me to believe, that other solutions exist of a yet more general nature. Onfunctional equations of the second and higher orders. When we consider functional equations of an order super rior to the first, new difficulties present themselves; the artfices which were used with success in the preceding part of this paper, are no longer of any avail.

With respect to the function f it is arbitrary, there are however, some observations respecting it, which require notice; as without an attention to them we might fall into error. In the first place, it is evident,, that we must not MDCCCXV. H S8 Mr. BABBAGE's assay towards -make/v equal to x, for in this ease we at once determine Ax to be equal to x, which is not always true. The same observation may be made with respect to making x =x, for in this casehV XX iX XI IX= A54 &? and we in fact by assuming this value for f determine 4 fromn the equation F {S. 4'X, x, , Xi &c }The same objection does not hold when we make f3x-x, though this considerably limits the generality of the solution; apparently the most eligible mode of determiningf is from the equation fn+l x x, for in this case supposing we are acquainted with a particular solution of (a) containing any number of arbitrary constants, such as -xA {a, a, bcc, &c.} we may substitute for each of these constants an arbitrary functions such as X {x, fX , X PIfX for it 'i evident this function does not change when I we substitute f'x forx. But this form off is not always correct, it may be inconsistent with the original equations In fact, the only value we can assign tof which shall not in some measure limit the generality of the Problem, is to suppose a particular solution of the given equation. As an example of this method take the following problem.

With respect to the number of arbitrary functions which enter into the complete solution of functional equations of higher orders than the first, I have little at present to offer; the difficulty of the subject, and the wide extent of the enquiries the calculus of functzons. 42 l to which it would lead, induce me to postpone it until I have more time for the consideration. The following remarks may suffice for the present to point out some of its difficulties and the mode of enquiry. If 4't=f {ta~b,&c.} (i) ifx=f x, a, b, &c. 2 . > 4 X{, a, b, &c. (3) .J() 3 &c. &c. X X, { a. ab,&c.} (n) n From this by eliminating n of the arbitrary constants a, b, &c. we have an equation of the form F Em, Act, to a .. An Z} = o (a) and it might possibly be concluded that equation (1) containing n-1 arbitrary constants is the general solution of this last equation: but this is by no means the case. In the first place between the two equations (i) and (2), more than one arbitrary constant may be eliminated, thus let i -bx from which we find the two quantities a and b have been eliminated, and it is possible to select a value of Ax, between which and 2 x an infinite number of arbitrary constants could be eliminated. But waving this objection let us consider the case of (a) which is deduced from the elimination of n-1 arbitrary functions. We have seen in Problem VI. that a function of the first 422 Mr. BABBAGEIS essay towards order may satisfy any number of conditions (which are not contradictory) simultaneously; and there appears no reason for denying this property to those of higher orders. If now we consider the symmetrical functipn X {x, X, 4' x,. ,' X V x} and if Av+ I -x. It is evident this function will not change by the substitution of 4' x, 't x, &c. or Xn x and consequently that a different function similarly constituted may be substituted for each of the arbitrary quantities a, b, C. &c. in (1) which is the solution of the equation F ;x,4 x,4'Ax, . x }=o (a) The number denoted by u is arbitrary (it may, however, become determined from some particular circumstances of the equation (a). Thus we have introduced into an equation of the nth order, an unlimited number of arbitrary functions, each of which contains the function whose determination was sought with all its different orders to an undefined extent. If we take the particular case of '_ a U must beunity, and a general solution is Ant-_XX ~AZ-X taking another solution 4'~~~~bae and A I -X 7 (X+~X) if Xn X _a? 1, and supposing 4x =f (x, a, b, &c.) any particular solution we have for the general one the calculus of functions. \ f X,/ % (x Air tInt), x (xr, -'P Xm, X~la) &c. from which equation of the n-.-ith degree 4 must be found. When we apply these considerations to functional equations of many variables, other and even greater difficulties present them-nselves, the first step in that direction must be an improvement in the notation. Since the above was written, I have bestowed some attention on functional equations involving two or more variables, and I have met with considerable success: I am in possession of methods which give the general solution of equations of all orders) and even of those which contain symmetrical functions. I have also discovered a new and direct method of treating functional equations of the first order, and of any number of variables, and this new method I have applied tothe solution of diffierential and even of partial differential functional equations.
