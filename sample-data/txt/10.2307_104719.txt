[619] XII. To Mr. H. Baker F. R. S. of extraordinary Heat in Feb. and of the same Earthquake. Dear Sir, T H E Temperature of the Air was found to be warmer by my Thermometer (abroad) several Days of the last Month at 2h p. m. than I had observed it to be some Days in June last, at the same Hour; but, on Thursday Feb. 22. at 2h p. m. it stood at near 63; and soon after rose to 63 full; which is higher, as appears from my Register, than it was at the same Time of Day, 18 Days in the Month of June. And I find, by an Account sent me from Mr. Canton, of SpitalSquare, that his Thermometer was at the same Degree at 2h p. m. t e same Day. Read March 8. 1749 50. This perhaps may be thought not unworthy to be register'd in the meteorological Accounts in the Phil. Trans. but is submitted to the Judgment of the Royal Society, by Your and their most obedient, Tooting, March 8. 1749-50. humble Servant, H. Miles. P. S. I was this Morning, at 5h 40~ surprised with a violent Shock in my Study, which shook the Doots of my Book-Presses exceedingly: It was felt all over this Town and the next. I have not Time for further Particulars, nor am I able to say as yet, whether it was caused by the blowing up of a Powder-Mill, or by an Earthquake. K k k k 2 XIII.
