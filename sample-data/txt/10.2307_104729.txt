Observations on the Earthquake, March 8. 1749. by C. Mortimer, M.D. Secr. R. S. Devonshire-street, near Queen's-Square. ON Thursday Morning, March 8. 1749. I awaked a little after Five; I open'd my Curtains, and observed the Sky hazy: I drank a Draught of Water, and,looking, on my Watch, found it to be but half an Hour past 5; and therefore was going to lie down again in my Bed; when, leaning upon my right Elbow, I first felt a Shock, as if the whole House was violently pushed from the N W to the S E and then, with equal Force, pushed back again from S E to N W between which Shocks I heard a dull Noise; as if something heavy, but soft, rolled to and-fro' in the Garret over my Head. I saw the Cornice and Ceiling of the Room sensibly move, and then perceived a third and fourth Shock, so slow as to give me Time to reflect what might be the Event; and then a fifth and sixth, which I own began to frighten me; the Strokes seeming to be exceeding strong; not at all like a qu king or tremulous Motion, but like a forcible Shoving backwards and forwards; much resembling the Rocking of a Coach, when crossing the Rutts, or giving Way to another Carriage.

[639] what was the Matter? saying, the Wainscot Partition between the 2 Rooms seem'd as if rending asunder. The Whole seem'd to have lasted about 3 Seconds. I find that a Post, which supports the above-mentioned Partition close to the Door-case, has given way a little; the Paint being fresh<inferred>Crack</inferred>'d; and a Crack in a Wall upon the Stairs is grown something wider. The Door between the two Rooms, which shuts with a Fall-Latch, that was unlatched'd by the first Earthquake, and flapp'd to and fro' three or four times, was not unlatch'd by this last; which I think is an Argument, that by the first the House was lifted up, and that it was not so by the last, but only rock'd from Side to
