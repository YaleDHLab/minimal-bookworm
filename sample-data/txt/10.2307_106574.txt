[20] V. Extract of a Letter from Edward Pigott, Esq. to M. de Magellan, F. R. S.; containing the Discovery of a Comet. Read November 27, 1783. S I R, I HAVE the pleasure of informing you, that I discovered a comet on the 19th instant, and have made the following observations on it. York, Nov. 22, 1783. Date. R. A. North Decl. 1783 h. ' o ' o ' Nov 19 11 15 41 0 3 10 20 10 54 40 0 4 32 Nov. 21. This night I saw the comet where I expected it, according to the above determinations; but could not observe it with an instrument. The comet looks like a nebula, with a diameter of about two minutes of a degree. The nucleus being very faint, is seen with some difficulty, when the wires of the instrument are illuminated. It is not visible with an opera glass.
