III. An Account of some Eclipses of the Sun and Moon, observed by Mr Tho. Brattle, at Cambridge, about four miles from Boston in New-England, whence the Difference of Longitude between Cambridge and London is determin'd, from an Observation made of one of them at London. By J. Hodgson. ON the 12th of June 1694. in the morning I went to the Colledge at Cambridge, about 4 miles from Boston, and observed, with the Brass Quadrant there, with Tellescopick Sights, the Rays of the Sun being transmitted through one of the said Sights, on a clean Paper, pasted on a plain piece of Board, and fastned at right angles at about a foot distance from the said Sight, on which Paper I had drawn a Circle between 2 and 3 Inches Diameter equal to the Suns disk, and within that several Concentrick Circles dividing the Diameter into 24 equal (1631) equal parts, whereby I could observe to 1/2 a digit,the room in which the Observation was made was darkened with Blankets, and in order to render the Observation the more Exact (Mr Henry Newman assisting me all the while) I took the Altitude of the Sun with the <inferred>aforesaid</inferred> Quadrant, as followeth. Observations made of the Suns Altitude before the Eclipse began, in order to rectifie the Watch. By the Watch Comp. Altit.

So (1633) So that the Eclipse h Began at 9 14 Mane. Ended at 0 38 P. M. Lasting in all 3 24. Note, that in the Calculation, the Latitude of Boston was allowed to be 42. 2~5. The second is of a Lunar Eclipse, that happen'd Feb. the 11th, 1700, in the evening, as follows. The Moon rose eclipsed, and the Horizon was so overcast, that I dispair'd of having any observation; but at 1/2 an hour past 6 she came from under the Cloud, and at 6 h 25~ I had just a sight of her, and judge her eclips'd about 5 digits, at h 6 29 The Section equidistant from M. AEtna & Horminius. 32 Palus Maraeotis begins to be seen. 34 1/2 Palus Maraeotis and Mons Apollonius 1/2 out. 37 1/2 Palus Maraeotis quite free, and Palus Maraeotis and Palus Maeotis in the perpendicular. 42 3/4 The Shadow near an Inch from Palus Maraeotis, Mons Horminius and Mons Hercules. 46 1/4 Palus Maraeotis in the Nadir, and that part of Palus Maeotis to my right hand in the Prime Vertical. 57 The upper part of the Section is now, and has been for a long time in Insula Major in Mare Caspio (and the Section now perpendicular) and the lower part wheeling about from Palus Maraeotis. 7 20 Mount Sinai first appears at 22~ wholly free. 25 1/2 Palus Maraeotis and Mons Horminius near perpendicular. 43 The Eclipse over in the Telescope, and at 49 to to the naked Eye. My Clock was set by my Ring-Dial about 9 a Clock in the morning, as exactly as I could judge, and the obY y y y y y y y y servation (1634) servation was made with my 4 1/2 foot Telescope, with all four Glasses in it. The Observation of the Eclipse of the Sun on the 27th of November 1703, was as follows. At half an hour past 8 in the morning, I set my Clock exactly by my~ Ring-Dial, and at half an hour past 9 they nicely agreed, at h 10 00 The Sun was not touch'd. 06 The Moon enter'd on the S S W Point as near as I could judge. 15 The Eclipse was considerably advanc'd. 20 seem'd to be about half a digit eclipsed, rather more than less, and the Section to be a small matter more Westwardly. 10 25 Much the same, and near the same point. 30 seem'd to be less. 33 1/2 The middle of the Section nearer the S W, and the Diameter of the Section less every way. 37 ~ Much less and nearer the West. 44 ~ It ended, and was just over, going off near the S W, so that all the while it was within a point or two of the place where it first came on, or between the S S W and the S W. I judg'd when it was at the height, that the Chord of the eclipsed part was nearest equal to the side of an inscrib'd Decagon, or subtended about 1/10 of the Periphery of the Sun's Disk. I observ'd this Eclipse with a Telescope of one joynt, 4 foot and a half in length, and had only 2 Glasses, so that it inverted the object; and I had a red Glass which suited it, so that I could screw it in just before the EyeGlass, and was not fain to hold it in my hand, as when I ob(1635) I observ'd the Sun's Altitude with the brass Quadrant, which was a great convenience. The last is an Observation of the Eclipse of the Moon on December the 12, 1703 in the morning. Time by the Clock. h ~ 11 45 That part of the Moon's Disk near ~Alabastrinus, looks somewhat duskish, and the Eclipse beginning to enter between Palus Maraeotis and M. Porphyritis. 11 53 The true Shadow was well entred. 58 M. Porphyritis just cover'd. 12 03 1/2 near 3 digits darkened. 7 1/2 Mount AEtna begins. 9 1/2 quite covered. 14 1/2 Lacus Niger major and M. Sinai almost equidistant from the Section of the Shadow, Lacus Niger Major, being somewhat the nearer of the two. 18 ~ Lacus Niger Major begins 19 1/2 quite covered. 21 3/4 Mount Sinai begins. 21 3/4 Quite covered and the Moon about 6 digits eclipsed. 12 24 ~ Besbicus begins. 26 Quite covered. 28 3/4 Bysantium begins. 29 1/2 Covered and Mount Horminius begins. 32 Apollonia begins. 33 Covered. 37 The Shadow equidistant from M. Corax and Mount Paropamisus, or somewhat nearer to Mr Corax. 39 ~ between 9 and 10 digits eclipsed. 43 M.Corax begins. Y y y y y y y y y 2 44 (1636) h 12 44 ~ Palus Maeotis begins, and at 45 3/4 the inner of M. Paropamisus begins. 50 Palus Maeotis quite covered. 51 1/2 The Moon not quite eclipsed. 52 Nor yet. 53 Nor yet. 54 Scarce. 54 1/2 Quite Immerg'd and the ~ begins. 14 39 Precisely, she Emerg'd between Palus Maraeotis and Mons Porphyritis. 42 Palus Maraeotis begins. 43 Quite clear. 47 M. Porphyritis quite clear. 55 About 3 digits restor'd. 59 Mount AEtna begins. 15 02 That and Lacus Niger Major at the same time clear. 8 1/2 Mount Sinai about half free. 9 1/2 Quite free, and about 6 digits restored. 15 Besbicus free 19 1/4 Bysantium free. 29 1/2 About 9 digits seem'd to be restor'd. 30 1/4 Mons Herculis free. 32 3/4 Palus Maeotis begins. 38 1/2 Quite free. 41 1/2 Insula Major in Mare Caspio free, and in the middle of the Section. 42 1/2 Not yet wholly clear. 45 Fully over in the Telescope, tho a kind of a Smoak remained some little after to the naked Eye. In order to the adjusting of the time, I set my Clock with the greatest exactness I could the morning preceding, both from my Ring-Dial and the rising of the Sun, which I very narrowly watch'd and observed, and found it to agree (1637) agree with the Sun's setting the following evening; so that it went all the time the Eclipse was, very steadily and regularly; but for the greater Certainty and Satisfaction, I took the Altitudes of the following Stars with the Brass Quadrant with Telescope Sights out of my Chamber window, the lowness whereof would not permit me to take them, when they were at all higher elevated. in dextro humero Orionis. ~By the Watch Comp.

This is all the account that can be given at present, by Sir, Your Humble Servant, T. B I had the good fortune (by the assistance of some ingenious Friends in Pinch-Lane, near the Exchange) to make some few observations of the last, of December the 11th, 1704 (of which I gave an account to this Honourable Society some time since) as follows. The Heavens being cloudy most part of the night, it was 35~ after 4 in the morning following, before I could (1638) could perceive that the Moon was eclipsed, and then as near as I could judge, she had been so about 3 or 4 minutes at most, from whence we may conclude it began at London about 31 or 32 minutes after 4 the same morning. Mr Brattle found, that at 44 minutes after 11 at Night, part of the Moon's Disk look'd somewhat duskish, and that at 52 minutes, the Shadow was well entred, so that from hence, as well as from a Comparison of the Ingress and Egress of the principol Spots, it probably began there about 49 minutes after 11, whence it follows, that Cambridge in New England lies 4h 4~ 2 1/2, or 70 37~ to the Westward of the Meridian of London. I happen'd to see the Moon the same morning at 35 minutes after 5, when she wanted at most but 3 minutes of being totally eclipsed; so that at London she immerg'd at 38 minutes past 5. Mr Brattle saw her immerge exactly at 54 minutes after 12, whence it follows,that the difference of the Meridians found by comparing these observations,is 4 h 43~ 1/2, or 70~ 52~ agreeing very well with the former; so that by taking a mean between them, the difference of Longitude of the 2 Places is 4 h 43~, or 70~ 45~. I saw no more of the Eclipse that morning, and should be very glad to meet with some other observations to confirm these, but their mutual agreement gives great reason to believe that the Deductions are good, and may be rely'd upon.
