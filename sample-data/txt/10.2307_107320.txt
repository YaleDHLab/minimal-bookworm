XVI. Of the Attraction of such Solids as are teteminated by P1aneS and of Solids of greatest Attraction, By Thomas Knight, Esq, communicated by Sir FH. Davy, LL. D. Sec. R. S. Read March 19, 1812. JATHENUATICIANS in treating of the attraction of bodies, have confined their attention, almost entirely, to those solids which are bounded by continuous curve surfaces; and Mr. PLAYF AlI if I do not mistake, is' the only writer, who has given any example of that kind of invquiry, which is the chief object of the present paper. This learned mrathematician has found expressions * for the action of a parallelopiped; -and of an isosceles pyramid, with a rectangular base, on a point at its vertex ; and observes, on occasion of the first mentioned problem, that what he has there done, cc gives some hopes of 'being able to determine generally the attraction of solids "bounded by any planes whatever.' It is this general problem, that I venture to attempt thd solution of, in what follows viz, any7 solid, regular or irregular, termin"ated by plane surfaces, bein g given, to find, both in quantity and direction, its action on a point, given in position, either within or without it.* Ed. Trans. VOl. VI. P. 228 to 243. It is proper however to observe, that Mr. PLAYFAIR'S expression, at p. 4z, for the action of a parallelopiped, requires to have its sign changed ; being, as it stands at present, negative, from the imanner of correcting the flu ent.K k 2 248 Mr. KNIGHT on the Attraction of such Solids Nor has the matter any difficulty, as far as theory* onlv ia concerned; although, actually to find the attraction, of a body of very complicated figure, may, no doubt, be exceedingly laborious and troublesome: for no one, I suppose, will conceive, that it can be done in any other manner, than by a previous partition into more simple forms, each of which must have its action found separately. Having completed this part of my subject in the three first sections, I next apply the formulas, given in ?. 1, to find the attraction of certain complex bodies, which, though not bounded by planes, have yet a natural connexiol with the preceding part of the paper. Finally, the fifth section treats, pretty fully,, of solids of greatest attraction, under various circumstances ; and I do not know, that any one of the problems there given has been before considered by mathematicians; whilst, on the other hand, the results of former writers are easily derived as corollaries. For the sake of perspicuity, I have divided the paper into, propositions, and shall terminate this short introduction by .xpressing a hope, that I may not be chargeable with unner cessary prolixity. Of the Attraction of Planes bounded by right Lines. As all such figures may be divided into triangles, it seems natural to begin with these.* It is usual, I think, with mathematicians, to consider a thing as done, when it can be pointed out how it may be done. Thus M. LAGRAN GEA, in his excellent work Ad De la Re'solution des Equations nume'riques," says (p. 43) "cette methode ne laisse, "Ce me semble, rien a desirer .' where, of course, he can only mean, as far as relatas to theory. as are terminated by Planes, &C. 249 Prop. I. Let rvm, fig. i, be a triangle, right angled at r, and pm a right line, perpendicular to the plane of the triangle, at the angular point m; it is required to find the attraction of the triangle, on the point p, both in quantity and direction. Conceive a plane to pass through the point p, parallel to the plane of the triangle, and, in it, the lines pg, po, respectively parallel to rm, rv. The problem will be solved, if we find the actions of the triangle, in the directions of the three rectangular co-ordinates pm, pg, po. Draw ks parallel to rv, and put a pmn, b =rm, T= ink, t=kq; then pq = s/a2 + i' + to. Let r = tang. vmr, then ks r x kin. The element of the plane at q is T x t, and its action, on p, ti in the direction pq, is ,-at; by resolving which, and putting A, B, C for the actions of the triangle, in the directions Pm, p po,, we get A=j a' t _; B=f 2LL C-ff T??

If, whilst r remains constant, b and a are supposed to vary, but so as to preserve the same ratio to each other, the 2b M , KIGHT an the Attrc!tzit of such $Qlids partial forces A, B, C will remain unchanged, as, consequently, will the total force, both in quantity and direction. For, if we put in x a for b, the expressions of the forces become ~ (t, nt, r) arc (tang. i), (imr-), 4(irr); which are independent of the absolute values of a and b. It is scarcely necessary to, observe, that arc (targ. a_-) is the arc, to the radius unity, corresponding to the angle rvM. Cor. 2. When r becomes infinite, the triangle rmv is changed into a parallelogram, infinitely extended in the direction rv; in which case, the expressions of the forces become verysimple, viz. A arc (tang. +)! B -L. CVaz?z c CL b+ Va2+ bz a Prop. 2. Let vmu, fig. 2, be any triangle whatever, pm a line perpendicular to the plane of the triangle, at the angular point m: from whence, let fall the perpendicular mnr on the opposite side uv; moreover, let pg, po, be respectively parallel to rnr, vu. It is required to find the actions of the triangle vmu on the point p, in the directiot's pmn, Pg, pO. If we keep the same, denomirinations as before, and put, besides, r'= tang. umr, it is plain from the last proposition, and because the action of the whole must necessarily equal the sum of the actions of its parts, that VA @(a~br-)+ up(a~br')arc (tang. r)arc (tang.-r B=X(a,br)+X(abr'); C (a, b,r) (a,b,r'). When umnv is a right anglel, we shall evidently have arc as are terminated by Planes, &c. 25 (tang. +) + arc (tang. = being the number 3,1415, &c.: this makes the expression for A somewhat sims pier, in that case. If it is the triangle vmu' whose attraction we seek, we have, putting r' = tang. u'mr, A-q(ab,r)-cp(a,b,r')arc(tang.=I)+arc(tang.-==~) B-=X(anbnr)-X(a~bnr1); C b (abfr)-JJ(a.-,ber'). Cor. i. As a rhombus may be divided, from its centre, into four-eqUal triangles, like that in fig. a, but right angled at m, the angle lying at the centre; 'if b represent a perpendicular from the centre of a rhombus on one of its sides, and r and r' the tangents of the angles, that this perpendicular makes, at the centre, with the semi-diameters of the figure, we shall have for the action of the rhombus, on a point situated perpendicularly over its centre, at the distance a, A -q4 q (a, b, r) + 4a (a, b, r') 2r. Cor. 2. As any plane, terminated by right lines, may be divided into triangles fromn a point within it, we may find, by means of this proposition, the attraction of such a plane, on a point above it, both in quantity and direction. Let, for example, uvu'v'u, fig. 6, be the plane, p the attracted point; let fall the perpendicular pm on the plane, and from m draw right lines to the angles U, v, u', v'; the plane will thus be divided into triangles, situated, with respect to the point p, like that in the proposition. The attraction may still be found, if the perpendicular should fall without the figure; as in MDCCCXII, L I 2S4 Mr. KNIGHT on the Attraction of such Solids Prop. 3. To find the attraction of a triangle umv, fig. 3, on a point p any how situated. Let fall from p the perpendicular P-M', on the plane of the triangle ; join mn'm, m LI, mrv. Find, by the last Prop. the attractions of the triangles m'uV, m'um, m'vm, on the poinft p; and resolve them into others in the directions of any three rectangular co-ordinates: and, when thus resolved, let the actions of FU <1 FA B ,C~ m'u lI in the directions of these I ' ' ilm' vmj co-ordienates be LA", B"', Ca1 It is plain, that thie actions of the triangle u'mv, Oin p, in the directions of the same cd-ordinates, will be A -A'-All; B B' B"; C --C C". There may be other cases of this proposition, in which the triangle and point are placed dififerently, with respect to each other, from what I have represented in fig. 3 but the reader, who understands the case that has been considered, will have no difficulty in any other that may occur. Though the preceding propositions contain every thing that is necessary, for finding the attraction, both in quantity and dircction, of any plane bounded by right lines; yet there are some cases worthy of a particular notice: as Prop. 4. To find the attraction of a rectangle mrvr', fig. 4, on a point p sitiated perpendicularly over one of its corners as m. Draw pg, po, parallel to mr, mr', the sides of the rectangle; put b = rm, b' r'm, r _ tang. rmv, r' = tang. r'mv: then, if as are terminated by Planes, &c. A, B, C represent the actions of the rectangl-e, in the directions pM, pg, po, we find, by means of Proposition 1, A= p(a,b,r) + q (a,b 'r')27 B X(a, b, r) + (a,b',r'); C-(ab, r) + X (a, Y, r). We may eliminate r and r', from these expressions, by bt b means of their values bb and T, and thus we may put A under a very simple form. It becomes, at first, A _ arc (tang, 7 x a + arc (tang.

In a similar -manner, might the expressions for B and C be simplified: but it is perhaps easier to find new forms, ab mnia, Thus we may get B immediately, from the double integral B-fJ j^+ z+,)T 'if the fluent, with respect to t, be taken froai t o to t _ b'; and, with respect to T, from T o to T_ b. The first integration gives B = , OZ+ and, by the second., T2 a"+bA + b' Va2z+b2-A/b a -A L 1 2 Mr. KNIGHT Onf the Attraction of such Solids It is plain that, to find C, we need only change b into b', and the reverse, in the last expression, whence A f+bA+ b Va-f+bz4 Yz + b C =-L. lb+ b L. ---b -b b a Ob ProP. 5 To find the attraction of a regular polygon, on a point Situated perpendicularly over its centre. As this figure is composed of isosceles triangles, if we put b for the perpendicular from the centre on one of the sides, ,and r for the tangent of half the angle at the centre, subtended by one of those sides, we have, by Prop. 1, for a polygon of n sidCes A = -2n arc (tang. =r-/I + al 2g arc (tang. which, because the last term (n 2) At, by Euclid 1.3, Cor. 1, is I _ A 2n arc (tang. .

This is only a particular case of the last proposition, when n is infinitely great and r infinitely small. It is easy to see, that the arc whose tangent is + / + L+!r? bm ra~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~2 will have for its cosine ra if we keep only the first power -of r; consequently we may put it under the form 7 -arc ra ra sine = ~very nearly, thismuiW as are terminated by Planes, &c. to pried by 2n is nr n-V by putting r for nr. If we substitute this value in the expression for a regular polygon, it becomes A -i { ia the well known expression of NEWTON. Of the Attraction of Pyramids, and generally of any Solids wuhati ever that are bounded by Planes. The sinpiest case of the attraction of such bodies as we are to consider, is that of a pyramid with the attracted point at the vertex: and it fortunately happens, that on this simple case the action of any body whatever may be made to depend; which is the reason of my placing the general problem in this section, though I afterwards treat separately of prisms. This facility, in the case of pyramids, results from what was shewn in Cor. t. Prop. i, viz. that if we put x for a and mx for b, in the functions p (a, b, r), X (a, b, r), 4 (a, b, r), they -will become 1 ( , m, r), X ( i, m, r) i (i, m, r), into which x does not enter. Prop. -7. Let figure 5 represent a pyramid with a triangular base umv, the vertex p of the solid being in a line pm, perpendicular to the triangle at the angular point m. It is required to find the action of the pyramid on, a point at that vertex. Draw the perpendicular mr, also pg, po parallel to mr, rv. Join pr, and let r'nV be parallel -to rm. Call pm', x, r'm' y; then y mx, nm being the tangent of the angle rpm. The attraction of a triangular section of the solid, made by a plane, MS8 ~r. KNrGHT on the Attraction of such Solids passing through r'm', parallel to the base, will be found by Pro/p 2, if we put x for a, and mnx for b; and is in the respec. tive directions pm, pg, po. A = p (i, m, r) + A (i, m, r') arc (tang. arc, (tang. ' l3=( ir, r) Ha (1,fr') Cin(imr) O ,r) If we multiply these by X' and take the fluents, the actiols. of the pyramid are foundI to be A = x(m, n,r) + xp (,m, r') > x arc (tang.x + arc (1:ang,. ~ ~ ~ ~ an-, rrn (tang. r= B -x (xx1, m, r) + X (i, m, t'); C 4a (i,m, r)x (i, m, r'). If the pyramid, whose action we were seeking, had been that whose is u'mv, we must have used the other values of A, B, C given in Pt*p. 2. Prop.80 Let fig. 6 represent any pyramid whatever, whose base uvu'v'u is terminated by right lines; to find its attraction, on a point at the vertex p, both in quantity and direction. Let a perpendicular from p meet the base at m, and draw lines from this point to all the angles u, v, &c. of the base. It is plain, that the solid will thus be divided into such pyramids as were considered in the last proposition; so that the prosblem is already solved. Cor. We may apply this to the pyramid whose base is a rhombus, and the vertex placed perpendicularly over its centre. By proceeding -as in the proposition, it will be divided as are terminated by Planes, &c. 259 into four equal triangular pyramids; and, using for each of them the notation of Prop. 7, we have for the action of the whole rhomboidal pyramid, o n a point at its vertex, A 4P (I. m, r) + 4Ax (i, m, r') 2VX. The other attractions evidently destroy each other. It is not necessary, in the above proposition, that the perk pencdicular pm should fall within the base; if it falls without, we shall however Ihave occasion for the following problem. Prop. 9. Let umv, fig. g, be any triangle whatever, p a point any how situated with respect to it; join pm, pu, pv.* It is required to find the attraction of the oblique pyramid pumv, whose base is the triangle umv, on a point at the vertex p. Let fall, from p, the perpendicular pm' on the plane of the base umnv, draw the lines m'm, nm'u, m'v. Find, by Prop. 7, the attractions of the pyramids pm'uv, pm'um, pm'vm, whose bases are m'uv, mIum, m'vr, and their common vertex p. Resolve these attractions into others in the directions of any rectangular co-ordinates, and when thus resolved let the ace tions -of the pyramids I pmtutnl in the directions of these [A , B , C l PM'uM,>nA B IC 1Lpm vmj co-ordinates be CLA 1 C"j It is plain, that the actions of the pyramid pumv, on the point p, in the directions of the same co-ordinates, will be A _ A'. A"'; B-B' B"; C -C '.--C". * I have not actually drawvn the lines, to avoid coiifusion in the figure. 260 Mr. KNIGHT on the Attraction of such Solids Prop. 10. Let fig. 4 represent, in every respect, the same as it did IF Prop. 4; join pr, pv, pr'; it is required to find the attractioi of the square pyramid pmrvr', on the point p at its vertex. If we proceed as in Prop. 7, but make use of the expressions, for the action of the rectangle mrvr', found in Prop. 4, and put x for a, -mx for b, m'x for b', (where m = tang. rpm, mf," tang. r'pmn) there will result A xp (1,m,r) r+xq (1,m',r') B = xZ (i, m, r) +4x4 (i, im, r'); Cx(l, ir) 4, x (1 m', r') But it will be better to make use of the more simple express sions, that were given in Prop. 4, by which means, we get A = arc (tang.

Let the base of the pyramid be a regular polygon; the vertex situated perpendicularly over the centre of the base; the attracted point at the vertex. By making use of the expression in Proposition 5, putting x for a, and mx for b (m being the tangent of the angle, at the vertex, formed by the axis of the pyramid and a line drawn from the vertex to the middle of one of the sides of the base, we get as are terminied by Planes, &C. A = Fax arc (tang. V1 i ( 1r1t) n') (n _ 2) rX. Hitherto, I have considered the action of a pyramid, only ,on a point at its vertex; the case which next presents itself, is that of the attraction on a point p' (fig. 5 and 6) any where in the produced axis Dpp'. It would be easy to give a direct solution to this problem, but I choose rather to make it depend on the propositions that have been already established: and to shew that the functions (a, b, r) X (a, b, r) A (a, b, r), of which so much use has been made, in the preceding invest tigations, are sufficient in all casey of the attraction of bodies bounded by planes. Prop. 12. Let pumv (fig. t) represent the same pyramid as in Prop. 7; to find its attraction on a point p' in the produced axis. Suppose p'u, p'v joined, the attraction of the pyramid pumv, on the point p', is the difference of the attractions of the pyra. id~s p'umv, plupv on the same point,; which point being at the common vertex of these two pyramids, their attractions are found by Propositions 7 and 9; and the problem is solved. Pro!. 1.X8 'Let it nowv be the action of -the pyramid pumv, fig. 7,,(where tlhe plane of the base umv is not perpendicular to the line rnpp') oon ti e point p', that is required. The attraction sought for wviil still be the difference of the actions of the two pyramids p'umv, p'upv, but these nust now both be found by Prop. q. MDO Lt .M la 2~.62 Mr. KNIGHT on the Attraction of sutch Solids Prop. 14. Figure 6 representing, in every respect, the same as in Prop. 8, it is required to find the action of the pyramid, on the point pt, in the produced axis. As this solid may' be divided into others, situated, with re-pect to pI, like that in Prop. 1 , the problem is solved by what wvias shewn there. If the attracted point was not in the line p'pm, perpendicular to the base, but in some other line ppi, passing through the vertex, and meeting the base in It; draw lines from p to all the angles of the base, and the1 solid will btedivide'd in Such pyramids as were treated of in Prop. 13. ProP -i . Let pumv, fig. 7, be any triangular pyramid whatever, and let it be any how cut by a plane, whose intersection with the pyramid is the triangle Fly; it is required to determine the action of the portion OArvum (which is cut off by the plane) on a point at p. The attraction, of the solid in question, is the difference of the actions of 'the pyrarnids pumv and pagy, which actions are found by Pro,,p. 9. Prop. 16, or general Problem. To find the action of a'ry solid, bounded by planes, on a point either witIhin or without it. It is plain, that by drawing lines, from the attracted point through the solid, this may always be divided, either into such pyranmids (with the point at the vertex) as were considered in as are ternihiated by Planes, &c. 2!63 Prop. 9, or into portions of pyramids, like that treated of ini Prop. i ; and consequently the solution of the problem may be obtained by me ns of these propositions. ?.

The attraction of any other right pris , i1 the direct o; of it&. length, depends on the same function F (b, r, x); as in Prop. 18. To find the attraction of a right prism,, wbose base is a rect-anwgle, on a point in the produced axis. We saw in Prop. 4, that the action of a rectanrgle, on a point situated' perpendicularly over its centre is A AP (a, b, r) + V (a b, 14) -2r where b and 1/ are the halves of the sides of the rectangle, and r and r' the tangents of the angles, formed respectively by those sides and the diagonal. By changing a into x, and muultiplying by , we have, for the prism, A = 4fxq, (x, b, r) + 4fx (x, b', rt) _ 2iX whencQ. by what was done in the last proposition, A = 4F (b, r, x) + 4F (b', r", x) 2'xx + corr..

Prop. 20. Let pr'v'vrm, fig. 8, be a right prism, whose base is the triangle vrm right angled at r. It is requdr to determine its attraction on a point at p, in the directions pm, pr', po; Po being parallel to r'v'. If we wvish to obtain a solution by means of what has been already done, we may conceive the solid under consideration to be divided into twvo pyramids; viz. the pyramid pmrv with the triangular base mrv; and tdie other pyramid pr'vlvr, whose base is the rectangle r'v'vr; the polint p being at the comnmon vertex of both. Put pm x, mr = pr t-x'; conceive the diagonal vr' to . be drawn, and put tang. rmv = tang. r'pv' = r; tang. v'rr r'; tang. vr'v' = r"; tang. rpm =n's tang. rpr' =n'. We get immediately, from propositions 7 and io (putting A, B. C for the respective actions itn the directions pm, pr', po) A-xp (1, n, r) x arc (tang. +) 4x' (1in"r') + x'{ (1, r, r"); B xx ( 1, ?', r); + 4./ (i,', r)^ + X'p ( i, r, r) -x' ; C x ( 1, m, r) + x't.

In finding them e values, the first expressions of Prop. 10 were made use of; if we take tlhe others, there w 'ill result th-e simpler forms A-xp( 1, mr).-xarc(tang. ) +-'{L.(V+A/ +r) rm B = xX ( 1 , r) . x' arc (tang. .66 Mr. KNIGHT of te Attraction of sucb Solids C =X (i, in, r) X'{L , (Vi + n' + in') _ L Vj+ml'+rz + ml These are, perhaps, as simple expressions as can be hcad in this case; we m ay however find others; nor is it necessary to conceive the solid divided into pyramids. Thus we may obtain the value of the force A, by the me. thod of the preceding propoitionsi . a triangular section of the prism, parallel to the end r'pv', and at a distance x from that end, will have its action on p expressed by D (x, x', r) -arc (tang. = 4-), using the same notation as before ; therefore, the action of the pyraImid, in the direction pm, is A .=fxg (x, x', r) _ x arc (tang. -) F (x', r, x) -x arc (tang. = 4-) + corr. Another Way ofjinding theforce B. Drawv ks parallel to r'v'; call pk, x'; then ks = r x x'.

I have dwelt the longer on this proposition, because the atl traction of right prisms, ill all cases, may be made to depend on it. Cor. i. It is in the first place evident, that by means of this proposition, we may find, by parts, the force, both in quantity and direction, with which a point q, any where on the edge pm of the scalene prism represented by fig. 9, is attracted. The same may be said of the action on p' any where in the produced axis ; this will be the difference of the actions of two prisms, like that in the figures Cor. 2.Moreover, if, instead of the prism in fig. 9, the poin-t q was placed any where on the edge of a prism whose base is the triangle quv, fig. 10, the action may still be found; for it will now depend on the difference of the action of such prisms, as were treated of in the Proposition; that is to say, the action of the prism whose base is quv as the difference of the actions of those whose bases are qvr, qur, qr being a perpendicular eon vU produced. 68 Mir. KNIGHT ont the Atitaction of such Solids Prop. -u To find the quantity and direction of the attraction of a right prism, whose base is any triangle whatever, on a point any where on its surface. Let the triangle uyvu' fig. ii, be a section of the prism pa. rallel to its base, and through the attracted point p. Let fall the perpendiculars pi', pr', on the opposite sides: and the solid may be divided into four prisms, whose bases are the right angled triangles pur, prv, pvr', pr'u', and the attraction of each of these, both in quantity and direction, is givern by Prop. 20. It is plain that there may be other cases of this problem besides the one here considered; for instance, one of the perpendiculars may fall 'beyond the base; but it would be endless, in a subject of this kind, to consider every particular case, and in none cam the intelligent reader find the smallest difficulty, Prop. 22. To findthe attiracIion of any prism, fig. 12, whose base is a convex polygon uvu'v, on a point q any where within it. As such a solid may be divided into triangular prisms, like those in Prop. 2o and its corollaries, with the attracted point on the common edge pm, the problem is already solved. If the point, be at p', in the line mp produced, the action on it may stilltbe found, being the difference of the actions of two prisms, like that in the figure. Prop. 23. 'Let vuv', fig. 13, be the section of an isosceles prism; pv a lile passing through the vertex v perpendicularly on the as are terminated by Plane, &c. 269 mwiddle of the base It is required to find the action of the prism on any point p in the line pv. This action is equal to the action of the prism whose base is the triangle v'pu (given by Prop. 2o), less the actions of the prisms whose bases, or sections, are the triangles v'vp, uvp, which are found by Cor. 2, Prop. 0o. Scholium. I considered here only an isosceles prism; but the solution is just the same, if the section of the prism is any triangle whatever, as v'uv fig. 14, and tie action on a point p, (situated in the line uv produced) is required. For the attraction wanted will be the difference of attractions of the two prisms whose bases are the triangles v'up, v'vp, and these are given by Cor. 2, Prop, 20.o Suppose the base of the prism, whose attraction is required, to be the trapezium v'u,3, fig. 14, the action of this on p, being the difference of the actions of the triangular prisms, whose bases are VI'v, jxv, is found by the case just now considered. In this manner, might cases be multiplied without end; but I think it is sufficiently plain, that by means of the preceding propositions and scholium, we may find the action of any prism whatever, on a point either within or Without it. ?. IV. Of the Attraction of certain Solids not terminated by Planes. The expressions, arrived at in the first section, are useful in finding the attraction, not only of such solids as are bounded by planes, but of a great variety of others; viz. of such as MDCCCXII. N n e7O Mr KNIGHT on the Attraction of suck Solids have th-eir sections in one direction continuous curves, whilst1 being cut in a different way, there results, from their intersection with a plane, a polygon, or rectangle, or some other right lined figure. As no o one that I know of, has considered the actions of stich bodlies, I shall offer no -apoloffy for givring a few ex, Let -u v'u', fig. i,5, represent inye regular polygon, whose plane is perpendicular to the line pm, and its centre in that line: moreover, let this polygon be variable in magnitude, and move parallel to itself -in the direction pm, in such a manner, that the m-iddle point r of each of its sides uv, may describe a given curve pr. Prop. 24. Let it be required to find the attraction of the solid thus generated by the polygon, when the curve pr is a circle, an'd the attracted point at the vertex p of the solid. The attraction of a regular polygon was found in Prop S and it will be adapted to our present purpose, by putting xe for at, and 2kX-x' for bt, where k is the radius of the circle pr: and we have, for the attraction of the solid, A nf-ncarc (taiig. =r/ t +2(2kx -X2)-n ) r or A = 2nfy arc (tang. -r V2k (YT-P2) X-r~x2) (nx2)t That part of A, under the sign of integration, equals 2nX arc (tang. 2V(1+i') X-72X) 2nfx arc (tang, rx~~~~x f =W V o(1+,te )xis a lb Wg\e may, not 'improperly, term tliis solid a Polygonal spbereO as are terminated by Plines, &c. and, -if we put zz _ x, the last term becomes 2flfz arc (tang. /2k( 1 + r) z') 7z~~~2 _____ , -k i-; = n ;this fluent is ~~~~~~~~~~I + , r L ~ sirl 4 r V 2k(L + ') r'ze V~//J'(izr) r 2n are ~(sine or by putting its value for z, n ( arc (siner) ._. i arc) (0 Vz k e i (+ r)2 Collecting all the parts of A, we have at length A -2fx arc (tang. 2/7k (1 + r2) x-tx2) __________ znk (I+r') rV7 V2k (+ + r )x-rx+ Jr arc (sine (n 2) vrx + corr.

This will appear to be an expression of great simplicity, if we reflect what very different solids it belongs to, from that whose rection is a triangle, to the sphere whose section is a circle. N n s Mr. KNIGHT onl the Attraction Of such Solids In the latter case n is infinitely great and r infinitely smallw r is also the tangent of n = if we reject the other terms of the expansion, on account of their smallness. The expression for A may then, in this case, be put into the form 2 kr 2nk r + r3tnow r{3 =(q .p) r{ +?' r } ( +3+ j whence the second term of the last number is changed into 2j 2kfl (iZijI r. 2kn .znk X i+4 -) r r 3 r 3kvi by r( + f 3 putting v for nr: and, by substituting this value, we have at last A = + kvr; which is the well known expression for the 3 attraction of a sphere on a point at its surface.

Let r' be infinite, then ro, and the solid becomes an infinitely long circular cylinder; and it is easy to see that the value of A is reduced to 2k7r, as we found before in a different manner. The foregoing problems, which I have chosen fromn a great oSMr. L{NYfGIT on the Attraction of such Solids varicty that occurred to me, are sufficient to shew the use that mnay be mi de of the expressions given in the first section. The attractions of certain infinitely long cylinders, which were derived, as corollaries, from some of the preceding pro. positions, present us with several curious relations; with these I shall terminate the present division of my subject. Let p o u t, fig. 1 S, represent the base, or section, of a circular cylinder, infinitely extended both above and below the plane of the figure. Let p be an attracted point in the circumference of the section. Draw the diameter pu, and, at right angles to it, the diameter ot. By Cor. 1, Prop. 27, the action of the whole cylinder on the point p is 2k7r (k being the radius of the circular section); the action of that half of the cylinder, whose base is the semi. circle opto, is 2k (7w -1 ); the action of the other half of the cylinder, which is furthest from p, is 2k: therefore, i. The attraction of a sphere is to that of an infinite circular cylinder of the same diameter (on a point at the surface of each) as to i, which is the ratio of the solidity of a sphere to that of its circumscribing cylinder. v. The attraction of the whole infinite cylinder, on p, is to the attraction of that half which is furthest from that point, as the circumference of a circle is to its diameter. S. Consequently, the attraction of the nearest half, is to that of the furthest half, as the difference between the circumference and diameter of a circle is to the diameter; or nearly as 2 to 1. 4. In the circle optu, fig. <8, inscribe 'the parabola owpvt, whose equation is kx = y, so that its vertex may be at p, and its axis coincide with pu: this parabola will plainly cut the as are terminated by Planes, &c. 283 circle at the quadrantal points o and t ; and, I say, that the action, on the point p, of the infinitely long cylinder, whose base is the parabolic area owpvtco, is to the attraction of the furthest half of the infinite circular cylinder, exactly as 2 to i. For the latter action has been shewn to be 2k; and if in the expression, obtained in Corm 2, Prop. 27, we make and x both k, it is reduced to A 4k. A.In fig. i8, draw fug perpendicular to pu at u; and from p, through o and t, the lines pof, ptg. The attraction, on the point p, of the infinitely long prism whose base is the triangle pfg, is equal to the attraction of the infinitely long circular cylinder. For the action of the prism is 4 x Pu x arc. fpu (by Prop. so) 8k x 4 2kvr; and this has been already shevn 4 to be the attraction of the circular solid. ?.V. Of Solids of greatest Aqttraction, The subject of this section has occupied the attention of Mr. PLAYFAIR,* in the same paper I have before noticed ; it had previously been treated of by SILVABELLE. TRISI also, in the third volume of his works, gives a solution of the same pro. blem as that which is first considered by Mr. PLAYFAIR, but his result is an erroneous one. None of these writers have pursued the fiatter any further than what relates to the figure of a homogeneous solid of revolution. My manner of treat* The problems which Tinvestigate are similar to tIe first of Mr. PLAYFAIR'S& where the equation of a curve, is sought; nor do I at all meddle with that other class of problems which he treats of in the subsequent part of the paper. 284 Mr. KNIGHT on the Attraction of sucb Solids ing the subject connects it intimately with the preceding parts of this paper; otherwise I should not have given the following problems a place here. Prop. 3m, Suppose that a given quantity of matter is to be formed into a right cylinder of the length .d; what must be the figure of its base, so that it shall attract, with the greatest force pose sible, a point in its surface, and in the middle with respect to its two ends ? Let fig. 19 represent a section of the cylinder, at the attracted point p, parallel to its base. It is plain enough, that, whatever is the nature of the curve pab, we may draw a line pb from p, which shall divide the area into two equal and similar portions pabp, pcbp. Put the absciss pd -_ x, the ordinate ad = y: the mass of the cylinder is 4dfyx; and, by Prop. 4, its attraction on p is 4fx arc (tang. , dy X-d-z+x.y-zJY2 Let C be a constant quantity, and we have only to make the fluxion of the following expression, with respect to y, equal to nothing,* viz. Arc (tang. dy + Cdy: this gives ( ' )d 7X+ C = O. or x'-C )3+yt)2 (d2+x'+y') _ for the equation of the curve pab. Make y = o, and let a be the corresponding value of x; the equation becomes iCa2 (d2+ a2) = o, whence C = m (da'+a) by substitutingE LER (I "Methodus, &c." p. 4z and 185-6-7. as are termibtated by Planes, &Ao, which value in the equation of the curve, it is uldawtely a4 (d+ at-) xI (x'+y1)1( d' + x+y) -_ o. It is proper to remark, that though, in theenunciation, I. spoke of the point as being in the surface of the cylinder, yet there is nothing in the above method of investigation that supposes it to be in contact with the solid: if there is to be a given distance between them, the nature of the curve will be the same. Cor. 1. If we make d infinitely small, there results as'%xz xz +752)3-o for the equation of the curve bounding t~e plane of greatest attraction; and it is evident, that, by the revolution of this curve about its axis, will be generated the solid of greatest attraction, when it is sought for without any such conditions or restrictions as entered into the pereeding problem. This exactly agrees with the conclusion arrived at by SILVABELLE and Mr. PLAYFAIR. Cor. 2. If, on the other hand, we make d infinitely great, the. equation is reduced toy = ax w', which is that of a circle whose diameter is a, the attracted point being in the circumference. Therefore,-of all iifinitely long cylinders, having the areas of their bases, or transverse sections, equal, that which has a circlefor the circumferetice of the said base, shall exert the greatest action on a point at its surface. P-rop. 3 . Let a given quantity of matter be fashioned into such a solid as was treated of at the beginning of the last section (in Proposition1s 24, 25, 26), viz. having its section perpendicular to the axis a regular polygon. The polygon being given in MDCCCXII. P P 286 Mr. KNIGHT on the Attraction of such Solids species, it is required to determine the nature of the curve pr, fig.

Prop. 33. Let the last proposition be again proposed, but with this diffqrence, that the solid, instead of being homogeneous, is to be formed of polygonal prismatic elements, having such a law of density as in the preceding lemmas. By proceeding as before, we shall have for the equation of the curve pr, fig. 15, 2nxr f (x, y)y ---I-As ~+ C2nrf (.T,y)y o, (X+y2) va+( * )y o(x+y2) v+ + r)y C = o; which is exactly the same equation as when the solid was supposed to be homogeneous. When r o we have, as before, adf= ( +Y)3 which shews that the result of Mr. PLAYFAIR extends to an infinity of cases besides that of homogeneity. When, as in our last supposition, r o, and the mass is a solid of revolution, the function f (a, T) expressing the density, is a function of the perpendicular let fall from any particle on the axis of the solid, and of the distance between the foot of that perpendicular and the attracted point. as are terminated by Planes, &cu Scholium. If the preceding lemmas, had been treated on the supposition that the density was variable along the line ks, fig. I, (which is the same as making the density f (t), or more generally f (a, T, t) a function of a, T, and t) their application to the problem we have been considering, would give an indefinite number of different equations, for the curve pr, fig. 15 according to the nature of the assumed function f (a, T, t) every one of which equations will, however, have this peculiarity, that if we make row o, it will become afx2= (x2+y5)3. Fur when r = o, t = o, and f (a, T. t) becomes a function of a and T only, and the case enters into Prop. 33 just now considered. It may be worth while to see an example of this; we should have had, In general, for the action of the polygonal prismatic element of the solid, by Prop.

These must be, integrated, with respect to t, from t o to t = rT: which cannot be done till we assign a form for the function f (a, T, t).

I shall just remark here, that, as the results of Prop 32, are not altered by conceiving the density any function of a and T, such is also the case with respect to Problem 31, if T there represent the distance of any particle from a plane passing through the attracted point and the axis of the cylinder. This the reader may easily convince himself of. The proposition just mentioned (31) is only a particular case of the following very general one. Prop 34. Let uvv'u', fig. 15, be a rectangle, whose plane is perpent. dicular to the line pm, and its centre in that line. Let this rectangle move parallel to itself, in the direction pm, and vary in such a manner, that the middle points r and r' of its sides may continually touch two different curves, as are terminated by Planes, &c. 291 The quantity of matter in the solid so generated being given, and the nature of one of the curves as pr', to find what must be the other curve pr, so that the action of the solid, on a point at its vertex p, may be the greatest possible. Put x for the absciss prn,y' and y for the ordinates mr', mr; then by Prop. 4, the action of the solid will be 4f arc (tang. -; and its mass is 4Ay'X. But y' is a given function of x, suppose f (x). The quantity Arc (tang. = yf(x) XVX2.+yl+ f(x)4 + Cf() is therefore to have its fluxion, with respect toy, made o: and this gives, for the equation of the curve pr, x .--+ CO or x2 C2 (X2+y2)2 (x2+yS + f (X)2) =0. Ex. i. Let f (x) = ax, or pr' be a straight line, the equation of pr must be 2 -C2(s2+y)Y{ (1+ a2) X+y} = 0.O Ex. 2. Let pr' be a circle, or f (x)2 = 2kx -x*, k being the radius, then Xs C2 (x2 +y3)2 (2kx +y2) -o, is the equation of the other curve. Ex. A. If pr' is a parabola, or f (x )2ax, the equation of pr is xI C, (xI +y)2 (ax + X2 +y2) 0. Scholiuzm. In Prop. 27, after having found the action of the solid there treated of, we derived, as corollaries, the action of parabolic and circular cylinders of infinite length, by separately making infltiite the diameter of the circle and the parameter of the parabola. Perhaps it might therefore be supposed, that if we made k infinite in the second of the preceding exampiles, or a, 29.2 -AfKNT. GIT 0' ? tr 1 A tra ton of 4 SolidX infinite in the third, the result would be the equation of the base of the infinitely long Cylinder of greatest attraction which however is by no means the case; for that was found to be a circle, whereas the equation we get here is x C' (Xs+ye) -= and if we make a infinitely great in the first example, the equation becomes C' x*+y or the line pr is a circle with its centre at the attracted polint. We might resolve this problem, on a variety of hypotheses respecting the density; or we might add other conditions of a different kind; foinstance, not only the mass of the solid, but the area of the section, passing through the required curve pr and axis pm, might be supposed constant. But I pass on to other suppositions respecting the force of attraction; which will be treated with as much brevity as possible. Lemma 3.

Nor is this observation to be confined to that particular case when the density is as t: if we had solved the problem on the supposition of any function of x, T, and t, for the density, it is easy to see that thouogh diflerent functions will give diflerent results when d is finite, yet when the solid becomes a plane, and d = o, ti e equation will always be reduced to rn+i a J (X + Y%)2* Hence we may conclude, that, the solid Qf revolution which shall exercise the greatest attraction on a point in its axis, w hei the force s inversely as the mth powaer of the di.5tance, and the density either uniform, or anyfunction whatever of x and T ( T being the perpendicular let fall from any particle to the axis of the solid, and x the distance between thefoot of that perpendicular and the attracted point) will have,-for the equation of its generating cu ve. amx _ (a's +y'Y) 2 Cor. 2.

Numberless other interesting questions might be proposed, relating to solids of greatest attraction; for instance, we may inquire what must be the curve bounding the base of a cylinder of given mass and length so that it shall exercise the greatest action in a direction parallel to its axis. But as this kind of inquiry proceeds exactly in the same way as the other (only we must use the attraction B, instead of A, in Prop. i.), it is unnecessary to lengthen a paper which has already been extended too far.

When x a, the first arc in the above expression becomes simply arc (tang. =(a) , and we have for the action r 2 H of the whole so/id, A = 4 i sn 4 representing p after a has been put for x. In like manner, inay the action of the solid be found when as are terminated by Planes, &c. 307 the guiding curve is an hyperbola; the only difference-between that case, and the one we have just considered, being in the value of7, which must be taken + 1 instead of1. Scholium to Cor. 3, Prop. 7, page 278. If the variable rectangle is given in species, and the touching curves are conic sections; that is, if y=(A X+ rx),y" t2(Ax+rx), we shall have, for the action of the generated solid, on a point at its vertex by Prop. 4, A =4fi arc (tang. + + 4fx arc (tang.

This is the action of an inf nitely long cylznder on a point at the vertex of its transverse section, the equation of the said section being y== o' ( Ax + yx2). Ex. If the base, or transverse section, is an ellipsis, or if 79 37ab (ax -x'), we have = -, /3=a, ry 1 ; and A=4 (x + _ arc (tang. = V Vax x7) + 4 arc V -X 2zab7, (sine -. r. When x = a, this expression is reduced to 2ab a+b Scholium to Cor. 2, Prop. 3o, page 28.1. If we would have a general expression for the attraction of such solids as the one we considered in the proposition, when the guiding curve is any conic section, or when = -a'e (Ax + 7X'), there arises at first (from the formula for the action of a rhombus) A=4frarc (tang.=I Vx'?
