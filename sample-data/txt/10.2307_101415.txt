An Extract of a Letter, containing some Observations, made in the ordering of Silk-worms, communicated by that known Vertuoso, Mr. Dudley Palmer,from the ingenuous Mr.Edward Digges. I herewith offer to your Society a small parcel of my Virginian silk. What I have observed in the ordering of Silk-worms,contrary to the received opinion, is: 1. That I have kept leaves 24. hours after they are gathered, and flung water upon them to keep them from withering; yet when (without wiping the leaves) I fed the worms, I observed, they did as well as those fresh gathered. 2. I never observed, that the smell of Tobacco, or smels that are rank, did any waies annoy the worm. 3. Our Country of Virginia is very much subject to Thunders: and it hath thundered exceedingly when I have had worms of all sorts, some newly hatched; some half way in their feeding; others spinning their Silk; yet I found none of them concern'd in the Thunder, but kept to their business, as if there had been no such thing. 4. I have made many bottoms of the Brooms (wherein hundreds of worms spun) of Holly; and the prickles were so far from hurting them,that even from those prickles they first began to make their bottoms. I did hope with this to have given you assurance, that by retarding the hatching of seed,two crops of Silk or more might (27) might be made in a Summer: but my servants have been remiss in what was ordered, I must crave your patience till next year.
