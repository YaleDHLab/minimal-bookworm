U49 On the Expansion of any Functions of Multinonualsa. By Thomas Knight, Esq. fCommunicated by Hu1mphry Davy, Esq. LL. D. Sec. . S. Read June 7th, 181o. TF HE expansion of multinomnial functions has, of late, been so ably and fully treated by M. ARBOGAST, in his learned work 'D u Calcul des Derivations,' that it may appear, perhaps, scarcely necessqry to add any thing to what has been xwritten, o n the subject, by that excellent geot eter. Nevertheless, as lhe is the onlv oVne that has hitherto cultivated this part of analysis with any great success ; and as it is agreeable, I lbelieve, to nost persons, to be oresented with various solutions to mathermatical Iroblems, I hope it will not be thought superfluous if I show how the same things may be accomplished in a very driff~ent manner. By the procedure here made use of, we shall also be enabled to arrive at many nlew and remarkable theorems (both for direct and zinverse derivation), which could 'not, I imagine, be very easily found by M. ARBOGAST'S method-Is. For a function of one simple rnuiuinomial, I give (amongst others) the same rules of 'irect dIerzvaii,, as that a'uthor ; but when there are manv, and in the nere difficult cases of double and triple multinomials, &c. or funczions of any number of these, I ofer n(ew and expeditious methods; whicha are demnonstrated with the less trouble, from the analogy which MDoCCCX. I 50 IV, r. KNIGHT on the Expansion reigns throughout, in this manner of treating the subject; and the regulari-y with which we proceed from the easy to the more complex cases. By means of this analogy also, the reader may without difficulty keep all the rules in his mnemory. 2. I shall begin with the expansion of any function of a simple multinomial. First method.* Iff (c + z) represent any function of c + z, and the fluxions be taken., separately, with respect to c and ,, the fluxional coefficient is the same in both cases: or (7 ( c+z)~ whence it follows; that fQ ,z)~ J~f ) z f(c + Z).

I represent by strokes over the f the fluxional coefficients of f ( ); the number of strokes mnarking the order. Though this is a complete solution of the problem, it affords by no mieans an easy way of calculating the coefficients; on which account I shall not troublethe reader with examnples. It will be shewn presently that the inethod of derivation in M. ARBoGAS Ts first section is easily obtained from this. . Second Method. I here, as in the former case, consider the quantity c + c x + c x, + c 34to be a binomial, and take the fluxional coefficient of the function with respect to C; but n ultiply by the partial fluxion c x, instead of C + 4 2 C X X 4 &c.; we find, by this wtay of proceedingfB lc for the sUM of all those terms in B that are multiplied by the powers 6e Mr. KNIGHT 0o the Expanszon of c. In like cnrwJ11 C will be the sum of all those terms, in the sarne coeflicient, that contain c and its powers, and, in general. Bc * the sum of those that have for factors 'I..jn the powers of c Hence is derived an easy method of finding any coefficient, when we know those that precede it: for if these partial values be united, there arises BfX +f,7U2 +J1_C 3 , &c. .......

Let it be required, for an example, to find the coefficient of 7 from that of x5 given in article 3.

To find BZ from equation (7) requires the use of both fluxYions and fluents; in (8) we are without the fluxional process; but, in its place, have the trouble of observing the numeral coefficients of each term: there is, however, a way of avoiding the mention of fluents, and the necessity of paying attention to these coefficients. If we con sider equation (j) and the mode of expansion derived from it, it wvill be evid ent, I i I llt that when-ever we have any power (as the mth) of c or c or c or &c. it must be divided by the product .3.4-....m. Thiis follows from the manner of finding the fluent of such a qUantity 'in as c c,( and the consideration that we cannot arrive at c with1 out having passed through all the lower powers, and repeated the fluential process at each. Hence results the following (z) (3) rule; (where by , 53 &c. I mean these quantities after we have neglected in each of them the terms that have been already specified). Omitting all the deno minators, multiPy nB by c; by c; , iii (3) fl by c; p by c; and so on: add these products to0 ether, and wherever 1 11 there is any power of c, C &c. as the nith,put the prdduct 2.34....nm for a denominzator, 6e.

We may, however, instead of proceeding according to the above given direction, omit the superfluous terms at last; and then the rule ,4llI be as follows B Bf, B Tofirnd take the fluxion ofn with renpect to c, c, c, &C. and after changing, every where, c iznto c , take thefluent with rspect to '1 ilst; observing to keep only once ihe same combination J] lettdrs.

I 58 Mr. KNIGHT onf the Expansion c C c X Ccj (where c is either tlhelast factor, with respect to the number of strokes, or the last but one, accordingly as q is equal to or greater than one); if B"...(rI) we make this term vary, with respect to c , we shall have the combination marked (a) over again. Let us next consider when it will be necessary to make c vary. In the termf (c) x P x c (,B), if we make c v "*?.~~~~~~~~(n+ i) , .mp vary, there arises the combination f (c) x c x P x kc); but the same coefficient (as B) that contains ( 3), will also r + ) /r ~(M m l) |".$.M P. m\p contain f (c) xc x P xX c x c which when we make it vary with respect to c gives also f (c) x c X P x Ic). Now c was here the last quantity or the last but one. We may then affirm, in general, that, if we ,make every term in B vary with respect to the last quantity, i-t and the last but one also, when this immediately precedes the last, not in place only, but in the number of its strokes, we shall get all the terms we ought to have, any firther varia tion only giving the same over again. From equation (9) we have then the following Rule, Tofind B take thefluxion of B with respect to the last of the n n -I quantities c, c, c, &c. in each term, and the last but one also, fit ?mmnediately precede the last in the nzumber of strokes. of any Functions of Multinomials. 9 "...m "...(m+ ) Change every' where c i into c and take thefluent with respect to this last. This is exactly the same rule as that given by M. ARBOGAST in p. 25 of his work. 7. The method pursued in this paper, has a remarkable advantage over M. ARBOGAST's in what he calls inverse derivation ; which I shall shew hereafter to be extremely useful in the expansion of double and triple, &cG multinomials.

To complete the theory of the expansion of any functioi of a simple multinomial, there remains, for us to solve, the follo wing Problem, It is required to find B without knowing. any of the coftcients that precede or follow it.

I shall take no notice of any numbers, which divide the different terms, till the end of the operation; havilig shewn, 'n Article 5, that it will be sui cient thlen to place the product 2.3.4...-.1 under every pth po10vr. There can be no difficulty in perceivng, hat all the cwn-i binations in 4may be der ved fo-m those terms in vA that are multiplied by the powers of c, in the following la rg ner. First, diminish the exponeAt of c by one. Tfen, dimi nish the exponent of one of the other quantities by one, and multiply by the qtantity that has the next greater number of strokes. For, if c P x ( V I be one of the combinatiolS in 4 , there must necessarily be in the comnhination I {I'*..r~a...4($-I) l"Xsbl V X (YC raX P X C X ( (':&) ; and from thlis the 1ormer one is derived, in the mnanneT above-mentionedl, by taking away the c and changing c into c We will next see if there be any quantities that it would be superfluous to manke vary.

All the combinations being thus formed, put the product '.23e4.-..1. under every 1.th power. The reader may compare this rule with that given by M. ARBOGAST, P. 36.

There remains the important Problem, Tofind B without knowzng any of the other coecients.. r It will be plain to any one, who in the least considers the methods that have been employed, that B must contain all the; r possible combinations of c, c, c, &c. e, e, e, &c. d, d, d, &c. &c. that can be formed with this condition, that the number of strokes be r.

The only difficulty then is to find these combinations (without the possibility of missing any, or the trouble of finding the same more than once) by some regular process of derivation. A rule was given in Art. 8, when we were considering the similar problem in the case of one multinoimial, for deriving all the combinations in1 B, in which the sum of the strokes is r r, from c' as origin of derivations The s'ame rule will apply here, butt instead of the one origin C, we have, in the case of two multinomials, the oriins Ir Ir--z ' CYr X~2 tIG r-sIe-X C$c e, qe,. e..... ce e.

The above expreosions if considered not only in themselves, but with respect to the fosrmulas that are im nediately deduf cible from their developemuent and combination, in the manner that will presently be shewn, appear to be the most general and important in this branch of analysis. 16.

If the function to be expanded contains functions of many double niultinomials, all the formulas, and rules, that have been given for o ne, may be extended to this case, by means of equations (%) Lind (x); in the same manner as a like extension was made in treating of simple multinomials.

It is scarclv necessary to observe that, when we have got a few of the higher terms, by this rule, the preceding ones may be found from t e equaton B~~5 M17 as in the case of one double multinomial. To find any coefficient, w ithout a knoviedge of the rest, when the function contains more -than one double multinomial, we must combine the rule in the last article, with what was shewn in article 14* e2. Thus we have a complete and simple theory of the expansion of functions of double multinomials; and from equations (z) and (x) a precisely similar theory nmay be derived for multinomials of higher kinds. But it is wholly unnecessary to enter into furvher details; we are able, without any more trouble, to see what must be the solution of the following General Problem. It is required, in the expansion of anyfun'ction of a multiniomial of any kind, tofind B the cocient of xm y' 2r uS vt &c. m,.n, r,s, s, &c. from B that of xm'+1 y rI m u" Vt & m -i,) r-.irst,&c. * ee Note 11. g/ y lzchons ofJ Multlomials. 83 Rule.

It will not be an improper termination of this pa-per, to state what are the peculiar advantages of the method pursued in it. To many, I have no doubt, its brevity will be a recommre-nd ation ; and that it requires no notation diffierent fromt tL.ai in common use. For though I have represented .some of thle fluxioal coeffiof any Functions of Multinomials. 8S C cients in an unusual manner, as ( I) by ( ) the doing C4. so was not necessary; but it appeared advisable to make a distin ctin between the taking the fluxion with respect to c, and the same operation with respect to c, c, &c. which cnter into the c (eicien Ms in a manner dihErent from the first. Tbhe uiforitv of the procedure is such, that, w uen we bave arrived at the rules for one simple multi omial, a person of any skill in this kind'of inquiry might easily divine those for the more difficult cases. But the most important circumstance is the perfection given to inverse derivation, and the facility with which z7e may, by that means, find any large number of terms in thex cxpansion of the higher kinds of multinoniials, as has been shvwn in article i8 and 19. The last advantage I shall notice is, that the same rtules of derivation serve equally tfor the expansion of a ft.rnction of one or of a thousand multinonials : whereas, from M. ARBOGAST'S nethods, it woukd not, I agime, be very easy to give a ruli in words for the expanasion of a function of five or six. 86 .19Zz7;nt KG-HT 011 t-e Exlansion fvi N c IT EI ExS i Note 1. the rule in article 8 may be differently enunciated thus.

If the last quantity but one be that which J precedes the last in the number of strokes make it vary in the same manner and take thefluent. Thiis simpler than the rule in a"rticle 8, and more conformable to th. miode of expression made use of in other parts of the paper. Note .T. In looking back on whiat I have written, I am. apprehensive it may be thought that I have affected too great brevity in the last paragraph of ar.'cle zi. That the reader may have no difficulty, the following problem is added, to illustrate what was said in, the passage alluded to. Problem. To nd at once B in the expansion of a fnctio of two functions of double zultino. mgn mials. It is plain that B must contain all the possible combinations of c's and e's (see the m,n1 notation of article zi) that can be forted with this condition ; that the number of left haad strokes be m; the number of right hand strokes n. Every rth power must be di vded by the product . Aid the fiuxional coe~fcient q , that multiplies each term, will lxve, for the left h.and figure and over it, the sum of the exponents of th c's in that term ; for thn right han d figure 13 the sum of thre exponents of the e's. Now to get all the combigations of the hind menitioned above, with their proper divisors, we must plainly take, for origins. of derivation, ill the terms of the followingb product, when actually multipHieic C f e m-1 c e + c'm 1e 2 ( e nml 0 kzo) + k x0o) [o .O) 1 1 ,0 I 0) taz.3..m 2.3 _(i I) 23...

If we wanted to find immediately B in a function of two multinomiails of a m, n, r, &c. still higher kind, the method would be exactly similar. Note IlLo In the preceding pages, I have considered the expansion of multinomial functions genetally a'nd abstained from giving particular examples, that tihe paper might not be extended to an unreasonable length. There are, however, some cases, -wbthen the function is a wbole positive power.-which require a sepa rate notice. The method of direct derivatton given in article 5, and a similar one at the end of article i I Will befil . I indeed is of no consequence, as the rules in article 6 and I2 are both easiCr than tfne former, and applicable to every case, But it will be necessary to give new methods of inverse derivation; for if we consider those in the paper, in article 7 for example, it will easily appear, that though they are true generally for the mth power, the case is very different when we give to this letter the particular valu1s s, z -, &c. The reason of which is that the fluxional coefficients off (c), a-er the first, or^ the second, ,or the th ird, &c. vanish; and these functions may be said not improperly, when compared with the general form, to give defective erpansions; anyy rules, therefore, whch depend on the depression of the fluxional coefficients olff (c) w11l be of no use here. The, fovlowing very extensive rule is the reverse of that, for direct derivation, in article z. It agrees, in its simplest case, with that of IAa OGAST in fli articde 36.

Similar rules for multinomnials of higher orders are formed with equal case; being the reverse of those that have been given for direct derivation.
