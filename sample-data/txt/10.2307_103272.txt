(371) IV. An Account of an Experiment touching the Propagation of Sound through Water. By Mr. Fr. Hauksbee, F. R. S. AN Experiment that I made some time since, shewing that actual Sound could not be trasmitted through a Vacuum, gave me an Inclination to try what would be the effect, to surround the Receiver that contain'd the sounding Body, with so dense a Medium as Water. Accordingly, as in the former Experiment, the Receiver which contain'd the Bell was screw'd down to a Brassplate, with a Leather between; This Receiver with its Bell, was suspended in a large GlassVessel, by Four Twine-threads to the top, and as many to the bottom: whereby it remain'd in the middle between both. Concluding likewise, that these Threads would so absorbe the Water when it should come to be put in, that there could be no Apprehension, that any Sound shou'd be convey'd by them from the sounding Body, any more than if they were intirely Water. Thus provided, the Clapper was made to strike the Bell, whose Sound was something less by the Interposition of the Glass, than it would be, had it been made in the open Air; however it was very audible, and might be heard at a considerable distance: It appear'd to the Ear to be very harsh, in respect to the Tone it afforded us. But now, when the Water came to be pour'd in, and the inward Receiver surrounded by it, at least an Inch and an half from the nearest part of the outward Glass, the Clapper again was made to ~ give the Sound; which it did, seemingly, very little less, In (372) in respect to its Audibility; but much more mellow, sweet, and grave at least two or three Notes deeper than it was before; as was observed by some of the Society then present.
