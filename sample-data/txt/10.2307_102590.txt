(47) V. An Account of what Rain fell at Townly in Lancashire, in the Years 1697, and 1698. with some other Observations on the Weather; being part of a Letter of the 12th of Jan. 1698. from Richard Towneley Esq; to Mr. William Derham. 1697 1698 January 5 13 6 47 February 7 17 5 88 March 4 93 20 16 April 4 12 20 95 May 11 88 8 95 June 8 92 6 45 July 13 50 10 37 August 40 25 21 50 September 46 90 21 79 October 27 60 22 26 November 10 72 24 72 December 24 50 20 42 Sums 205,70 189,92 These doubled 41,040 37,984 In the Table of the Observations I have only set the Quantity of Rain in Pounds and Centesimals, which if double, you will have them to answer to those Numbers formerly printed in the Philosophical Transactions giving the Numbers of half Pounds, and (near enough) the height of the Water also. So the last Year there sell G 2 189.92 (48) 189.92 Pounds Troy, which-doubled make 37,984 Inches, the Inches the Water would have filled any Cylindrical Vessel. As far as I have learn'd, the Mercury rises and falls much after the same measure in most parts of our Island, and of this you may better judge by some Observations I have here transcribed and sent you of the very low Stations, Dec. 28. about Three of the Clock Mercury 28,17. on the 29th about 2 h. 1/2 28,18. and Jan. 2. about the same Hour 28,05. and this time it hardly rise before I went to bed; and on the 6th still about 3 h. 28,19.but this time before 9 at Night it was got to 29,28. what I note is, that though once I saw it lower many Years ago, yet never since I kept my Observations, did the Quick-silver descend so often to those Pitches; or when it was found very low, did it ever continue so for any considerable time, as it hath done this Year, during which it hath never been very high, and as I remember, generally much lower than other Years. This hath proved very unseasonable here, and so backward, that I thought I had never known the like; but examining my Observations, I find that of 1673. much what as late, though the Consequence proved not so fatal to these Parts or all Europe, as this.
