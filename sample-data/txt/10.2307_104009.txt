(220) II. Mr. Stephen Gray, F. R. S. his last Letter to Granville Wheler, Esq; F. R. S. concerning the Revolutions which small pendulous Bodies will, by Electricity, make round larger ones from West to East as the Planets do round the Sun. I H A V E lately made several new Experiments upon the projectile and pendulous Motion of small Bodies by Electricity, by which small Bodies may be made to move about larger ones, either in Circles or Ellipses, and that either concentrical or excentrical to the Center of the larger Bodies about which they move, so as to make many Revolutions about them; and this Motion will be constantly the same Way that the Planets move about the Sun, viz. from the Right to the Left, or from West to East: But these little Planets, if I may so call them, move much faster in their Apogeon, then in the Perigeon Parts of their Orbits; which is, as you very well know, directly contrary to the Motion of the Planets about the Sun. I have not yet communicated these Experiments to the Royal Society, being in hopes of making some farther Discovery, or at least of shewing them after somewhat more elegant a manner than I make them at present, when you may expect to hear a farther Account of them from S I R, London, Feb. 6th, Your most Obedient 173~. Humble Servant, Stephen Gray.
