[ 517 ] XXIV. On the Calculus of Symbols.-Third Memoir. By W. H. L. RUSSELL, Esq., A.B. Communticated by A. CAYLEY, F.R.S. Received May 15,-Read May 21, 1863. IN my second Memoir " On the Calculus of Symbols," I worked out the general case of multiplication according to one of the two systems of combination of non-commutative symbols previously given. In the present paper I propose to investigate the general case of multiplication according to the other system. I commence with the Binomial Theorem, to which the second system gives rise. In my previous researches I obtained the general term of the binomial theorem when the symbols combine according to the first system by equating symbolical coefficients; here, on the other hand, I consider the nature of the combinations which arise from the symbolical multiplication, and obtain the general term by summation. I next proceed to the multiplication of binomial factors. Here the general term is obtained by considering the alteration of weight undergone by certain symbols in the process of multiplication. The multinomial theorem according to the second system is next considered and its general term calculated. I conclude the memoir with some applications of the calculus of symbols to successive differentiation. This paper completes the investigation of symbolical multiplication and division according to the two systems of combination, the general case of division having been worked out by Mr. SPOTTISWOODE in a very beautiful memoir recently published in the Transactions of this Society. I shall commence with expanding the binomial (zr+ ( ))n in terms of 'r. d a-1 ____-_+_1 I shall put in place of the symbol d and write a,, for a,-a2 , a-2,. a-al+il Now (5r+ )2 =2 + dg .

And by giving (r) the successive values 0, 1, 2, 3 .. . n, we obtain the entire product, and may write ( 7+O0 g) (7; +02g )(7; + 03).****(r+og <+$3s7>+1l9gr +6g2l97 Or + where Vgr'e', &c. are the groups we have just considered. 4 A 2 520 MR.

From this expression, by putting nm-(P+21y+3rf.. )s+ the symbolical coefficient of ery in the expression of the given multinomial may be immediately deduced. There are certain methods of expressing the differential coefficients of implicit functions by means of symbolical notation which I notice in this place, as the method of summation employed for that purpose is similar to some of the symbolical summations we have already considered in this paper. 522 iMR.

I shall not, however, enter upon these higher coefficients, my object being principally to call attention to the use of symbolical expressions in expansions of this nature. The subject of implicit differentiation has been treated by Mr. GEORGE SCOTT of Trinity College, Dublin, in a very elegant paper in the Quarterly Journal of Mathematics, vol. iv. p. 77. His results have great generality, but do not appear to include the above.
