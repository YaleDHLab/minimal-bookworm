A Letter from Sir Tho. Mostyn, Bart. to Roger Jones, M. D. F. R. S. concerning a golden Torques found in England. S I R, Gloddeth, Dec. 27. 1741. I Have received the Favour of your Letter, wherein you desire to be informed of the Particulars of my Torques. I wish I were able to give you a better Account, but have never seen nor heard of any Remarks made upon it, or any Account where it was found, but I think it was in this County. It is a Wreath of Gold, weighing, as near as I can judge, nine Ounces. I believe it is without Alloy, being very pliable; it answers exactly Virgil's Description, AEn. V. 558. and 559. Read Jan. 28. 1741 2. Pars leves humero pharetras: it pectore summo Flexilis obtorti per collum circulus auri. It being joined here with the Pharetra, and being very proper for carrying a Quiver, inclines me to think, that the Gauls, from whom the Romans took it, used it for that Purpose; but among the latter it seems to have been worn as an Ornament, rather than a thing of Use. There are several Passages in the Histo[25] Historians, which mention its being given as a Reward for military Service. It is sometimes described as a Chain consisting of several Links; but mine is all one Piece, without any Link or Joints, and takes its Flexibility from the Pureness of the Metal. I doubt not there are many Gentlemen of the S O C I E T Y, who can give a better Account of the Torques than I can. If, for your own Satisfaction, you have a mind to be further informed of the Use of it among the Antients, you may, I believe, find it in a Treatise written by one John Schefferus, de Antiquorum Torquibus, which is printed in Graevius's Collections, but I have not the Book here. I have not forgot the Oil or Scum which floats on the Sea about Midsummer, and will endeavour to have some saved the next Season. I am, Sir, Your most humble Servant, Tho. Mostyn. IX.
