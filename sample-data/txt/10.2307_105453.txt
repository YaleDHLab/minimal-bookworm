XVIII. Observations for settling the Proportion, which the Decrease of Heat bears to the Height of Situation. Extracted from a Letter of Thomas Heberden, M. D. F. R. S. to William Heberden, M. D. F. R. S. T H E remarkable transition from heat to cold in all seasons in proportion as we ascend the mountains here, induced me to make the following observations, with intention to discover if there subsists any regularity between the difference of heat and the elevation of situation. In order thereto, besides several observations made at different times, without any remarkable variation, I took the opportunity of a journey of some English gentlemen in October last, whose curiosity led them to ascend the mountain, called here Pico Ruivo, being the highest land on this island, the perpendicular height of which above the sea's surface is, according to Mr. de la Luc's method of mensuration by the barometer and thermometer, 5141 8/10 English feet. Being supplied by me with the proper instruments, 4 and Read March 28, 1765. [127] and their watch adjusted by my regulator, they carefully remarked the hour and minute each observation was made, which on their return was compared with the height of the thermometer and barometer in my study at the time of the observation, of which I had kept an exact account during the journey. From which observations I have formed the following table, supposing the descent of the barometer 1/10 of an inch for every 90 feet.

N. B. The thermometers were Fahrenheit's. Although the different degrees of heat in different places must depend greatly on the accident of situation, with regard to mountains, valleys, and to the different soils, &c. yet there is so much regularity in the above observations, that, perhaps, we shall not err [128] err much in computing (where the soil and surface are tolerably uniform) `` the decrease of heat (by `` Fahrenheit's thermometer) in the proportion of `` one degree for near 190 feet of elevation on this `` island.''
