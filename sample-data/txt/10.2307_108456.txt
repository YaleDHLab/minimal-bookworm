[ 651 1 XXXII. Contributions to the Chemistry of the Urine.-Paper IV. On so-called Chihylous Urine. By HENRY BENCE JONES,MlU.D.,M.A.Cantab.,F.R.S.,Physician to St. George's Hospital. Received January 2 1,-Read March 14, 1850. URINE white fromn the suspension of a quantity of fatty matter in it, has been called chylous urine, and the albumen and fibrin which escape from the blood with the fat have been considered to belong to the chyle and not to the blood. An opportunity of observing a case of this disease having occurred to me, I was led to make the following experiments. The conclusions therefrom are,1st. That the fat on which the white colour of the urine depends does indeed appear in the urine after the chyle is absorbed, but the albumen, fibrin, blood-globules and alkaline salts, may be found in the urine previous to any food being taken, and these substances can be made to appear in, or disappear from the urine according as the circulation is hurried by motion or quieted by rest. 2nd. That the disease consists in some slight alteration in the structure of the kidney, by which, when the circulation is most active, one or more of the constituents of the blood passing through the filter escape from the vessels into the urine. The supposition that the disease consists in an accumulation of fat in the blood which is thrown out by the kidneys carrying with it albumen, fibrin, blood-globules and salts is altogether disproved, both by actual analysis of the blood itself, and by the frequent occurrence of a large jelly-like coagulun in the urine, when no white fatty matter can be seen to be present. For an account of the patient and for the treatment and its ultimate effect in stopping the escape of the white water, which he had passed more or less frequently for nine months previous to my seeing him, I must refer to the Medico-Chirurgical Transactions for 1850. On the 19th of October hie camne to me, having taken food last at 11 A.M. Trre water passed at 2 P.M. solidified like blanc mange in ten minutes. It contained, when passed from the bladder, some clots ready-formed. It was very feebly acid to testpaper. Thrown on a filter., a very small quantity of reddish streaked fibrin remained on it. riThe filtered fluid, at 600 FAHR., had a specific gravity 1015. It coagulated by heat and acid. In appearance it was quite milky, but became clear when agitated with a considerable excess of ether. Some perfectly healthy blood-globules were seen with the microscope, and the granules of fat were so small as scarcely to be resolvable by a high power. 4 o2 652 DR.

Urine passed before breakfast, cloudy = 1022 6 = 18.38 Healthy urine free from albumen, precipitated by} 1 0202 =215 alcohol in excess. Second experiment.= 1021P2 = 3'48 The precipitate chiefly consisted of sulphates and a little phosphate of litne, and no uric acid. These experiments show most clearly the influence of rest and the effect of rising, (and even of waking) in causing the albumen to appear in the urine. The comparison, of the 5th day with the 7th or 9th, and the great difference between the 11th and 10th days is quite conclusive. In other experiments I frequently determined before-hand whether the urine before breakfast should be albuminous or not, by directing the patient to get up and move about early or to keep very quiet in; bed. And by keeping in bed all the day the urine throughout the whole day was very slightly albuminous. MDCCCL. 4 p 658 DR. BENCE JONES ON CHYLOUS URINE. It appeared to me to be very desirable to see whether the blood was milky. Mr. WILSON, of Tavistock Street, through whose kindness the patient came to me, bled him for me. The veins were filled with blood rather longer than usual before the opening was made; the blood came in a tolerable stream. The dinner, at 1h 30m P.M., consisted of a mutton chop with vegetables and bread. The blood was taken at 4h 30m P.M. into a thin wide mouth bottle. It was left to stand fourteen hours. There was no appearance of buff or cupping. The serum was opalescent, but not at all milky; and when agitated with ether it did not become clear, and the quantity of fat dissolved in the ether was very small. Blood . . . -1216 2 grs. (1.)

That so-called chylous urine may contain fat, albumen, fibrin and healthy blood-globules. 2ndly. That although the fat passes off in the urine after food is taken, yet the albumen and fibrin and blood-globules are thrown out before any food has been taken. During perfect rest the albumen ceases to be excreted, and it does not appear in quantity in the urine even after food is taken, provided there is perfect rest. A short time after rising early the urine may coagulate spontaneously, although no fat is present in perceptible quantity, and this may happen previous to any food. 3rdly. Though the urine made just before and a short time after bleeding was as milky as it usually was at that period of the day, yet the serum of the blood was--not milky. It did not contain a larger quantity of fat than healthy blood does. In other 4 P2 660 DR. BENCE JONES ON CHYLOUS URINE. respects, excepting in the diminution of the solids in the serum, the analysis of the blood corresponds with that of a case of cerebral congestion given by ANDRAL.

That the most important changes in the urine take place independently of the influence of digestion. 2ndly. That the urine in one respect only resembles chyle, and that is in containing, after digestion, a large quantity of fat in a very fine state of division; but the excess of fat in the urine is not caused by any excess of fat in the blood, for no excess of fat was found there. 3rdly. It appears that some change is produced in the kidney by which fibrin, albumen, globules and salts are allowed to pass out whenever the circulation through the kidney is increased: if, at the satme time, fat is present in the blood, it escapes also into the urine. That this change of structure is not visible to the naked eye on post mortem examination of the kidneys, Dr. PROUT long since demonstrated; and in a case of this disease, which was in St. George's Hospital, and was examined at Plymouth, no disease of the kidney was observed. From the total absence of fibrinous casts of the tubes from this urine, it is not improbable that by the microscope a difference may be detected in the structure of the mammary processes rather than in that of the cortical part of the kidney.
