[_ 311 ] XVII1. Researches on the Geometrical Properties of Elliptic Integrals. By the Rev. JAMES BOOTH, LL.D., F.R.S. Jc. Received November 17, 1851,-Read January 22, 1852. SECTION Ls I. IN placing before the Royal Society the following researches on the geometrical types of elliptic integrals, which nearly complete my investigations on this interesting subject, I may be permitted briefly to advert to what had already been effected in this department of geometrical research. LEGENDRE, to whom this important branch of mathematical science owes so much, devised a plane curve, whose rectification might be effected by an elliptic integral of the first order. Since that time many other geometers have followed his example, in contriving similar curves, to represent, either by their quadrature or rectification, elliptic functions. Of those who have been most successful in devising curves which should possess the required properties, may be mentioned M. GUDERMANN, M. VERHULST of Brussels, and M. SERRET of Paris. These geometers however have succeeded in deriving from those curves scarcely any of the properties of elliptic integrals, even the most elementary. This barrenness in results was doubtless owing to the very artificial character of the genesis of those curves, devised, as they were, solely to satisfy one condition only of the general problem *. In 1841 a step was taken in the right direction. MM. CATALAN and GUDERMANN, in the journals of Liouville and Crelle, showed how the arcs of spherical conic sections might be represented by elliptic integrals of the third order and circular form. They did not, however, extend their investigations to the case of elliptic integrals of the third order and logarithmic form; nor even to that of the first order. These cases still remained, without any analogous geometrical representative, a blemish to the theory. Some years ago, when engaged in the discussion of the problem of the rotation of a rigid body round a fixed point, by the'help of an auxiliary ellipsoid, I had continually brought under my notice, in the course of my investigations, the sections of a sphere by a concentric cone, or as they now are generally named, spherical conic* LEGENDRE a cherche 'a reprdsenter en general, la fonction dig.

BOOTH ON THE GEOMETRICAL PROPERTIES OF ELLIPTIC INTEGRALS. sections. It accordingly became necessary that I should give especial attention to the nature of those curves. I succeeded in showing that the elliptic integral of the first order, which is merely a particular case of the circular form of elliptic integrals of the third order, represents a spherical conic section whose principal arcs have a certain relation to each other. Besides, I was so fortunate as to hit upon the true geometrical representative of an elliptic integral of the third order and logarithmic form. I discovered it to be the curve of intersection of a right elliptic cylinder by a paraboloid of revolution having its axis coincident with that of the cylinder. These researches were published in the early part of the present year*. There still remained, without investigation, the case when the parameter is negative and greater than l. The geometrical representative of this peculiar form, I announced to be a curve, which I called the Logarithmic hyperbola. In the Theory of Elliptic Integrals, p. 1.59, I have said, " If a right cylinder standing on a plane hyperbola as a base, be substituted for the elliptic cylinder, the curve of intersection may be named the logarithmic hyperbola. It will have four infinite branches, whose asymptote will be the infinite arcs of two equal plane parabolas. This curve, and not the spherical ellipse, is the true analogue of the conmmon hyperbola." No demonstration, however, of these properties was given in that treatise. The main object of the following paper is to prove, that Elliptic Integrals of every order, the parameter taking any value whatever between positive and negative infinity, 'represent the intersections of surfaces of the second order. To these curves may be given the appropriate name of Hyperconic sections. These surfaces divide themselves into two classes, of which the sphere and the paraboloid of revolution are the respective types; from the one arise the circular functions, from the other the logarithmic and exponential. The circular integral of the third order is derived from the sphere, while the logarithmic function of the same order is founded on the paraboloid of revolution. Although in the following pages I have, for the sake of simplicity, derived the properties of those curves, or of the integrals which represent them, from the intersections of these normal surfaces, the sphere and the paraboloid,-with certain cylindrical surfaces; yet the intersections so produced may be considered as the intersections of these normal, surfaces with various other surfaces of the second order. Let UNDO be the equation of the sphere or paraboloid, and V=O the equation of the cylinder. The simultaneous equations U=0, V=O give the equations of the curve of intersection. Let f be any abstract number whatever then U+f V=o is the equation of another surface of the second order passing through the curve of intersection, Let U=O be the equation of a sphere, for example. Accordingly as we assign suitable values to the numberf, we may make the equation U+fV=O represent any central surface of the second order. But we cannot, by any substitution or* The Theory of Elliptic Integrals, and the Properties of Surfaces of the Second Order, applied to the inVestigation of the motion of a body round a fixed point. London: G. BELL, 1851. DR. BOOTH ON THE GEOMETRICAL PROPERTIES OF ELLIPTIC INTEGRALS. 313 rational transformation, make the equation U+fJV=O represent a non-central surface instead of a central one, or vice versd. Although a remarkable relation exists between the areas and lengths of some of these hyperconics, such as the circle and the spherical ellipse, yet more distinctly to show the analogy which pervades all those curves, I have not had recourse in any case to the method of " elliptic quadratures," as it is termed*. We cannot admit such a violation of the law of geometrical continuity as to suppose, that while a function in one state represents a curve line, in another, immediately succeeding, it must express an area. Such can only be taken as a conventional explanation, until the real one, characterized by the simplicity of truth, shall present itself. In the course of these investigations, it will be shown that the formulk for the comparison of elliptic integrals, which are given by LEGENDRE and other writers on this subject, follow simply as geometrical inferences from the fundamental properties of those curves; and that the ordinary conic sections are merely particular cases of those more general curves above referred to, under the name of hyperconic sections. It will doubtless appear not a little singular, that the principal properties of those functions, their classification, their transformations, the comparison of integrals of the third order, with conjugate or reciprocal parameters, were all investigated and developed before geometers had any idea of the true geometrical origin of those functions. It is as if the formule of trigonometry had been derived from an algebraical definition, before the geometrical conception of the circle had been admitted. As trigonometry may be defined, the development of the properties of circular arcs, whether described on a plane or on the surface of a sphere; so this higher trigonometry, or the theory of elliptic integrals, may best be interpreted as the development of the relations which exist between the arcs of hyperconic sections. Indeed it may with truth be asserted, that nearly all the principal functions, on which the resources of analysis have chiefly been exhausted, whether they be circular, logarithmic, exponential or elliptic, arise out of the solution of this one general problem, to determine the length of an arc of a hyperconic section. It may be said, we cannot by this method derive any properties of elliptic integrals which may not algebraically be deduced from the fundamental expressions appropriately assumed. But surely no one will assert that the properties of curve lines should be algebraically developed, without any reference to their geometrical types. We might from algebraical expressions suitably chosen, derive every known property of curve lines, without having in any instance a conception of the geometrical types* En considdrant les fonctions elliptiques comme des secteurs, dont 1angle est pr6cisnment 6gal 'a 1amplitude p, nous avons en I'avantage de justifier la denomination d'amplitude appliquee 'a 1angle 9; et me'me celli de fonctions elliptiques, en g6neral, puisque les courbes algdbraiques par lesquelles nous avons representes ces transcendantes, se construisent avec facilit6 au moyen des rayons vecteurs d'une ou de deux ellipses donn Us -VERxRULST, T aite den Fonction Eliptiques, p. 295.2 s 2 314 DR.

The theory of elliptic integrals was developed by a method the inverse of that pursued in establishing the formulae of common trigonometry. In the latter case, the geometrical type was given-the circle-to determine the algebraical relations of its arcs. In the theory of elliptic integrals, the relations of the arcs of unknown curves are given, to determine the curves themselves. This is briefly the object of the present paper. The true geometrical basis of this theory would doubtless long since have been developed, had not geometers sought to discover the types of those functions among plane curves. They were beguiled into this course by observing, that in one casethat of the second order-the representative curve is obviously a plane ellipse. -Hence they were led by a seeming analogy to search for the types of the other integrals among plane curves also. The author hopes in a future communication to the Royal Society, the present having grown under his hands beyond the limits he anticipated, to extend his researches to elliptic integrals with imaginary parameters, and to show the true geometrical meaning of such expressions. It has long been known, that, by the aid of the imaginary transformation sin p=v-7I tang4, we may pass from the logarithmic to the circular type, and conversely; but it has not, however,, been observed that this transformation enables us to effect this transition, because it changes the algebraic expression for the arc of a parabola into that for a circular arc or area, and conversely. The striking analogies developed between the formulae of the trigonometry of the circle and that of the parabola will be found very curious and instructive. I have attempted thus to place on its true geometrical basis, a somewhat abstruse department of analysis, and to clear up the elementary notions from which it may, with the utmost simplicity, be developed. It is only in the maturity of a science, that the relations which bind together its cardinal ideas become simplified. An author, whot has himself contributed much to the progress of mathematical science, well observes,-" qui il est bien rare qu'une th6orie sorte sous sa forme la plus simple des mains de son premier auteur. Nous pensons qu'on sert peut-etre plus encore la science en siMplifiant, de la sorte, des theories djaj connues, qu'en l'enrichissant de theories nouvelles, et c'est 1 un sujet auquel on ne saurait s'appliquer avec trop de soin."-GERGONNE, Annales des Mathknatiques, tom. xix. p. 338. II. I have ventured to make some alterations in the established notation of elliptic integrals, I have written i for the modulus, instead of c; andj for its complement instead of b; so that i2+j2= 1. The symbol c, used by writers on this subject to designate the modulus, was adopted by analogy from the formula for the rectification of a plane elliptic arc by an integral of the second order. Although in the circular forms of the third order it still signifies a certain ellipticity, yet it has no longer the same signification in the usual formn of the first order, or in the logarithmic form of the third. DR. BOOTH ON THE GEOMETRICAL PROPERTIES OF ELLIPTIC INTEGRALS. 315 Instead of the usual symbol, A=0/1 c2 sin2p=V1 -i2 sinkp, s/ has been substituted, when i is the mlodulus. Should it become necessary to designate the ampli. tude, the expression may be written VIN, or V/L. For the elliptic integrals of the first and second orders, which are usually written F,(p) and Ej(p), I have substituted ('and fdv/J. The surface of revolution may be named the generating surface, while the intersecting surface is always a cylindrical surface. The parameter, of which p is the general symbol, we shall suppose to vary from positive to negative infinity, and to pass through all intermediate states of magnitude. The nature of the representative curve will depend on the value assigned to the parameter p in the expression K . The modulus we shall assume [+P mn A] V 1-P son to be invariable and less than 1. In this progress from +so to oo, the parameter passes through thirteen distinct values, each of which will cause a variation in the species or properties of the hyperconic section, the representative curve of the given elliptic integral. In the following Table we may observe that the generating surface in passing from a sphere to a paraboloid, in its state of transition, becomes a plane. It is somewhat remarkable, that the common form of the elliptic integral of the first order does not appear in the Table, although it is implicitly contained in cases II. and VIII.; for in the circular form of the third order, when the parameter is equal to the modulus i, we can reduce the third order to the first. The reason why the first form of elliptic integral does not appear in the Table is this; in the thirteen cases given, the origin is placed at the centre, or symmetrically with respect to the represented curve. When the' elliptic integral of the first order is given in the usual form, without a parameter, it represents a spherical parabola, but the origin is nonsymmetrical, that is, the origin is placed at a focus. See Theory of Elliptical Integrals, p. 33. Instead of p, the general symbol for the parameter, we may substitute for it particular values, such as 1, m, or n, as the case may require. The quantities 1, m, n, i and are connected by the following equations i2+j2=I, bn=i2, and m-n+mn=i2, in the circular form, 1 i2+j2=] In=i2, and m+n-mn=i '2 in the logarithmic formf (1) m and n may be called conjugate parameters; while I and m, or I and n may be termed reciprocal parameters. These thirteen cases are exhibited in the following Table. 316 DR. BOOTH ON THE GEOMETRICAL PROPERTIES OF ELLIPTIC INTEGRALS. TABLE. Case. Sign. Parameter. Generating surface. Cylindrical surface.

When the generating surface is a sphere, we get the spherical hyperconic sections; when a paraboloid, the logarithmic hyperconic sections result. SECTION I.-On the Spherical Ellipse. III. A spherical ellipse inay be defined as the curve of intersection of a cone of the second degree with a concentric sphere. In the spherical ellipse there are two points analogous to the foci of the plane ellipse, such that the sum of the arcs of the great circles drawn from those points to any point on the curve is constant. Let rz and 03 be the principal semiangles of the cone; 2V, and 2(3 are therefore the principal arcs of the spherical ellipse. Let two right lines be drawn from the vertex of the cone in the plane of the angle 2a, making with the internal axe of the cone equal angles a, such that COS * * COS* (2.) These lines are usually called focals, or thefocal lines of the cone. The points in DR. BOOTH ON THE GEOMETRICAL PROPERTIES OF ELLIPTIC INTEGRALS. 317 which they meet the surface of the sphere are termed the foci of the spherical ellipse. IV. Every umbilical surface of the second order has two concentric circular sections, whose planes, in the case of cones, pass through the greater of the external axes. Perpendiculars drawn to the planes of those sections passing through the vertex,they may be called the CYCLIC AXES of the cone-make with the internal axis of the cone in, the plane of 2( 3the plane passing through the internal and the lesser external axvis-equal angles a, such that sin3 Cos .= Sina .(3.) Let a series of planes be drawn through the vertex, and perpendicular to the successive sides of the cone. This series of planes will envelope a second cone, which usually is called the supplemental cone to the former. The cones are so related, that the planes of the circular sections of the one are perpendicular to the focals of the other, and conversely. V. The equation of the spherical ellipse may be found as follows, from simple geometrical considerations. Let 2a and 2 be the greatest and least vertical angles of the cone; the origin of coordinates being placed at the common centre of the sphere and cone. Let the internal axis of the cone meet the surface of the sphere in the point Z, which may be taken as the pole. Let p be an arc of a great circle drawn from the point Z to any point Q on the curve. 4 being the angle which the plane of this circle makes with the plane of 2ac, we shall have for the polar equation of the spherical ellipse, 1 cos2,+ sin24+ tankp ~tank + tanki3 Tro show this, through the point Z let a tangent plane be drawn to the sphere. This plane will intersect the cone in an ellipse. This ellipse may be called the plane base of the cone, while the portion of the surface of the sphere within the cone may be termed the spherical base of the cone. The plane of the great circle passing through Z and Q will cut the plane base of the cone in the radius vector R; and if we write A and B for the semniaxes of this ellipse, whose plane touches the sphere, we shall have, for the common polar equation of this ellipse, the centre being the pole, 1 cos2if sink4 RI A2+ B Now the radius of the sphere being k, and p, a, it, the angles subtended at the centre by R, A, B, we shall clearly have R==ktanp, A=k tang, Bktanf; . . . e . . . .

VI. If in the major principal arc 2a of the spherical ellipse, we assume two points equidistant from the centre, the distance s being determn'ed by the condition COS 9= Cos as in (2.), the sum of the arcs of the great circles drawn from these points -the foci-to any point on the spherical ellipse is constant, and equal to the principal arc 2a. For a proof of this well-known property, the reader is referred to the Theory of Elliptical Integrals, p. 12. VII.

In the foregoing expressions (17.) and (28.) for the rectification of an arc of a spherical ellipse, the elliptic integrals are of the third order and circular form, with negative parameters. We shahl now proceed to show that the same arc may be expressed by an elliptic integral of the third order and circular form, having a positive parameter. It is shown in most elementary treatises on the integral calculus, in its application to the rectification of plane curves, that if p the perpendicular let fall from a fixed point as pole on a tangent to the curve, makes the angle x with a fixed right line drawn through, the pole, t being the intercept of the tangent between the point of contact and the foot of the perpendicular, we shall have dp ?s =Jpd +~ PI dp.... * .. v * * * * v (31.) and t= dx J The signs of s to be taken as the curve is concave or convex to the pole. XII. To investigate an analogous formula for the rectification of a spherical curve, the intersection of a cone of any order with a concentric sphere. Let a point Z be assumed on the surface of the sphere Fig. 3. as pole, and through this point a tangent plane ZAQB, or (0), to the sphere being drawn, the cone whose vertex is at 0, the centre of the sphere, and which passes through the given spherical curve, will cut this tangent plane (0) in a plane curve AQB, whose rectification may be effected, when possible, by (31.). Now a tangent plane OQP, or (T), may be conceived as drawn touching ...\ the cone, and cutting the tangent plane (0) in a right a line QP or t, which will be a tangent to the plane curve A..... . . in (0). It will also cut the sphere in an are of a great .........2 circle (zzm) which will touch the spherical curve in x. Let Q the distance QO of the point of contact of the line t with the plane curve from the centre of the sphere be R. Through the centre of the sphere let a plane OZP, or (1I), be drawn at right angles to the straight line t. Now this plane, as it is perpendicular to t, must be perpendicular to the planes (0) and (T) which pass through t. As the plane (LI) is perpendicular to the plane (0), it must pass through (Z) the point of contact of this plane with the sphere, and cut the plane DR. BOOTH ON THE GEOMETRICAL PROPERTIES OF ELLIPTIC INTEGRALS. 323 of the curve AQB in a right line ZP, or p, which passes through the pole, the point of contact of (0) with the sphere. This line p being in (II) must be perpendicular to t. The plane (H) will also cut the sphere in an arc of a great circle ZZU -=, perpendicular to x-, the tangent arc to the spherical curve; for these arcs must be at right angles to each other, since the planes in which they lie, (H) and (T), are at right angles. Let P be the distance OP of the point, in which the plane (HI) cuts the right line t, from the centre of the sphere; r the distance ZQ of the pole of the plane curve to the point in which t touches it, 7 being the angle which t subtends at the centre of the sphere, and k its radius, R2= k2+r2, P2= k2+p25 t2=r2_p =R2-P2 p=k sin-s, t=P tanr 7 is the angle between OQ and OP.

This definition is the more necessary, as the protangent will continually occur in the following investigations. The term is not inappropriate, as the pro-tangent is the projection of the radius vector on the tangent. XIII. To apply the formula (33.) to the rectification of the spherical ellipse. Let, as before, A and B be the semiaxes of the plane elliptic base of the cone, r the central radius vector drawn to the point of contact of the tangent t, p the perpendicular from the centre on this tangent, t the intercept of the tangent to the plane ellipse between the point of contact and the foot of the perpendicular, x the angle between p and A. Let as, P, p, ir, r be the angles subtended at the centre of the sphere, whose radius is 1, by the lines A, B. r, p, t, we shall consequently have A=ktan, 13=k tang, r--ktanp, p=ktanzir, and t= /k2+p2tan-r. .

In an ellipse, if 4' and X are the angles which a central radius vector, and a perpendicular from the centre, on the tangent drawn through its extremity, make with B2 tan2I3 the major axis, we know that tan =2tanx= tan tanx.

These circular forms arise from treating the element of the spherical conic either as the hypothenuse of an infinitesimal right-angled triangle, or as an element of a circular arc, having the same curvature. When we adopt the former principle, we obtain for the arc an elliptic integral of the third order, circular form and negative parameter, When we choose the latter, we get a circular form of the same order, with a positive parameter. Equating these expressions for the same arc of the curve, the resulting relation is LEGENDRE'S theorem. We thus see how an elliptic integral with a positive parameter may be made to depend on another with a negative parameter less than 1 and greater than i2. XVI. We must not confound the angle x in the preFig. 4. ceding article with the angle x in Art. (X.). Marking the latter X by a trait thusx,, to distinguish it from the former, we shall investigate the relation between them. Through ZO the axis of the cylinder, let a plane be drawn making the angle 4, with the plane ZOAa.

We may thus, by thie help of the foregoing theorems, show that when any elliptic integral of the third order and circular form is given, whether the parameter be positive or negative, we may always obtain the elements of the spherical ellipse, of whose arc the given function is the representative.

It remains now to exhibit a class of spherical conic sections whose rectification may be effected by elliptic integrals of the first order. The curve which is the gnomonic projection of a plane parabola on the surface of a sphere, the focus being the pole, may be rectified by an elliptic integral of the first order. DR. BOOTH ON THE GEOMETRICAL PROPERTIES OF ELLIPTIC INTEGRALS. 329 Let a sphere be described touching the plane of the parabola at its focus. The spherical curve which is the intersection of the sphere with a cone, whose vertex is at its centre, and whose base is the parabola, may be called the spherical parabola. To find the polar equation of this curve. The polar equation of the parabola, the focus being the pole, is r42_g being the parameter of the parabola. Let y be the angle which g subtends at the centre of the sphere, and p the angle subtended by r, then 2 tany tanp coSW Let p be the perpendicular from the focus on a tangent to the parabola, 1 the angle which this perpendicular makes with the axis of the parabola; p g Whence in the spherical curve, as p==k tans, g=k tanr, tanv=r tany ntcosts Qe**** o siny w hence si -(57 Introduce this expression into the general form for spherical rectification, =fsinMdp, +s given in (32.), we use the positive sign with a, since t= Now as r, z and p are the sides and an angle of a rightFig. 5. angled spherical triangle, since 2pj,=&, we get, by NAPIER'S rules, tanr=sinvtany., whence, by substitution, ~~~~d sin+ian' y~ tari7P ff-sm2 s/lcosty sininp an /-CO82,y sin 2p,.

When, on the other hand, the sphere becomes indefinitely small compared with the parabola, r approximates to a right angle, and (58.) becomes s=p + tan-'(tanp) 2p, as it should be, since 2p is the angle which the radius vector p makes with the axis. We shall find the notice of these extreme cases useful. XXI. Although we have called this curve the spherical parabola, as indicating its mode of generation, it is in fact a closed curve, like all other curves which are the intersections of cones of the second degree with concentric spheres. It is a spherical ellipse, and we shall now proceed to determine its principal arcs. Let ADG be a parabola, F its focus, 0 being Fig. 6. the centre of the sphere which touches the plane of the parabola at F. and being also the vertex of the obtuse-angled cone, of which the parabola ADG is a section parallel to the side of the cone OB.

Write x for tano, y for tang, and eliminate siny froin the preceding equations, tans -tan's=x2-y'=1,.. . . (59= ) the equation of an equilateral hyperbola. We thus obtain the following theorem:Any spherical conic section, the tangents of whose principal semiarcs can be the ordinates of an equilateral hyperbola, whose transverse semi-axis is 1, may be rect/fied by an elliptic integral of thefirst order. XXII. When we take the complete function, and integrate between the limits O and we get, not the length of a quadrant of the spherical parabola, as we do when we take the centre as origin, but the length of two quadrants or half the ellipse. We derive also this other remarkable result, that when p is a right angle, the spherical triangle whose sides are the radius vector, the perpendicular arc on the tangent, and the intercept of the tangent arc between the point of contact and the foot of the perpendicular, is a quadrantal equilateral triangle. For when =_ P 2' t 2' T 2 ~ ~ ~ i 2 It may also easily be shown, that the arc of a great circle which touches the spherical parabola, intercepted between the perpendicular arcs let fall upon it fromr the foci, is in every position constant, and equal to a quadrant. See Theory of Elliptic Integrals, p. 35. Hence the spherical parabola is the envelope of a quadrantal arc of a great circle, which always has its extremities on two fixed great circles of the sphere, the angle between the planes of these circles being +Y. Resuming the equations given in (59.), which express the tangents of the principal semiarcs of the spherical parabola in terms of siny, namely, I1?siny 2 siny tan2-s= +siny' tan2j3 =1 Sin' writing i for cosy, andj for sinry, we get 1-j 2-. _ tan21 e2= +J sin + whence tan2s=e2 =sinm=cos231. (60.) Now n=tan2s, m=e2; hence n=m=i. J XXIII. We shall now proceed to the rectification of an arc of the spherical para.bola, the centre being the pole. By this method we shall obtain certain geometrical results which have hitherto appeared as mere analytical expressions.

A geometrical interpretation of LAGRANGE'S theorem tan(4 ) siny tanD mesay be given by the aid of the spherical parabola. Let DRB be the great circle, the base of the Fig. 7. hemisphere, whose pole is F. Let BQA be a spherical parabola, touching the great circle at B, and baving one of its foci at F the pole of the hemisphere whose base is the circle DRJB. Let RQ be an arc of a great circle, a tangent to the curve at Q. From A F V ' B F let fall upon it the perpendicular arc FR. The point R is in the great circle AR which touches the curve at its vertex A. The pole of this circle is the 7 second focus F,; for AF,=FB=2. Let the arcs RF, RF, make the angles p and v with the transverse arc AB. Hence ARYv. In the spherical triangle FAR, right-angled at A, we have sinAF~tany cots. Now as AF=-, sinAF=siny=j; and if p=,x+>, v=p-p, or reducing, tan(p-p) j tants ; whence we infer that while the original amplitude is the angle p at the focus F, the derived amplitude p is the sum of the angles p and v at the foci F and F,. When the function is complete, orp4r, R will coincide with R, the pole of the great circle AB, whence v is also =2, and as p=p-+j, p=z. This shows, that when the function is complete, or the amplitude is a right angle, the amplitude of the derived function will be two right angles. When the spherical parabola approximates to a great circle of the sphere, the second focus F, will approach to F the irnmnoveable focus. The arc RF, will, therefore, approach to coincidence with the arc RF, or the angle v will approximate to fi', so that p.p+P=2p nearly. This is the geometrical explanation of the analytical fact observed in this theory, that when the modulus diminishes, or the spherical parabola approximates to a great circle of the sphere, the ratio of any two successive amplitudes approximates to that of two to one. When the transverse arc of the spherical parabola is a right angle and a half, siny7, and if C be its circumference, C= -+sr. But two quadrants 2s, or the loop of a lemniscate, are = /2. Hence 2s_(C-z. 334 DR. BOOTH ON THE GEOMETRICAL PROPERTIES OF ELLIPTIC INTEGRALS. Or the loop of a lemniscate is equal to the difference between the circumference of 371the spherical parabola whose transverse arc is 2, and a semicircle. When a quadrant of the spherical parabola is taken or when the point of contact Q coincides with the extremity of the principal minor arc of the curve, we shall have Since in this case RQ=PQ, FV=FV, therefore Fig. 8. p=OFV=OFV, orRFV=P+v.

Let the successive amplitudes p, ., X of the derived functions, be connected by the equations tanp p)=j tang, tan(4+-A p) =j, tan@, tan(z)=j,, tan,. . . .. (97.) We may imagine a series of confocal parabolas having Fig. 9. a common axis, described on a plane in contact with a sphere at their common focus. These parabolas will generate a series of confocal spherical parabolas on the / surface of the sphere, BCA, BC'A', 13C"A", BC"'A"', which will all mutually touch at the vertex B remote from the common focus F. Let the distances between the common focus F and the vertices of the plane parabolas subtend at the centre of the sphere, angles ty ry, r' &c*, whose cosines i, I,, It, &c. are connected by the equations 4/ 1 ~~ii + V/1i 2 r I /i-i 2)rrs it is plain that at-FA, y=FA', 7"FA", It/FA"', &c. We may repeat this construction successively, until the parameter of the last of the applied tangent plane parabolas shall become so indefinitely small, compared wIith the radius of the sphere, that it may ultimnately be taken to coincide with its projection. We shall in this way reduce, at least geometrically, the calculation of an elliptic integral of the first order to the rectification of an arc of a parabola, that is, to a logarithm, as in XX. If, on the contrary, the inoduli i, i,, ills &c. proceed in a descending series, the angles 7, ye r1,, continually increase, the magnitudes of the confocal applied parabolas increase, till at length their parameters become so large, compared with the radius of the sphere, that their central projections pass into great circles of the sphere. The evaluation of the elliptic integral will therefore ultimately be reduced to the rectification of a circular arc. These are the well-known results of the modular transformation of LAGRANGE. The formulae established in (58.) for the rectification of the spherical parabola, give r dp -1 sinytanF o.=sinySJ 1 9 i Coysin+ LP1-cos2y j or writing i for cosfyj for sine, and V/ for s/l-i' sins o1 and r' being the corresponding quantities for the next derived spherical parabola, 0!_T 340 DR.

Thus a simple ratio exists between the arcs, diminished by the protangents, of two consecutive confocal spherical parabolas. When the functions are complete, p is taken between 0 and 2; p therefore, as in article XXIV., must be taken between 0 and r; but when the amplitude is taken between 0 and X the function is doubled. Moreover, when the functions are comnplete, the point Q coincides with B; so that in this case the complete function represents, not one, but two quadrants of the spherical parabola, the focus being the pole. Hence as T= i=-Z. Whence putting C, ct, C"I C"', &c. for the circumferences of the successive confocal spherical parabolas, derived by the preceding law, we may write * ~~~~C z =I(Cwv) C,-7r=Vi1 (CII-X) I C 7r?= (X) . . . . . . . . .

(101.) Now we may extend this series, until the last of the derived spherical parabolas shall differ as little as we please from a great circle of the sphere. Let the circumference of this last derived spherical parabola be C,. Then C0=2-r and (101.) becomes (102.) Hence'calculating the quantity Q', we may express the circumference of a spherical parabola by the circumference of a circle.

It may not be out of place here to show, although the investigation mrore properly belongs to another part of the subject, that the arc of a spherical parabola may be represented as the sum of two elliptic integrals of the third order, having imaginary parameters; or in other words, that every elliptic integral of the ,frst order may be exhibited as the sum of two elliptic integrals of the third order, hav7inc imaginary reciprocal parameters.

Now the numerator is equivalent to 2j(1 -2 sin2@), and the denominator may be written in the form I -2i sin2s+i'Sin4 . But 2=i2(i2+j=), hence this last expression may be put under the form 1-i2 sin' +i4sin4p+i 2sin4 . This expression is tlhe sum of two squares. Resolving this sum into its constituent factors, we get d1 [1-i(i+, V-i) sino:p [1-i iV-) sin '] V1i=,2*n 342 DR. BOOTH ON THE GEOMETRICAL PROPERTIES OF ELLIPTIC INTEGRALS. Now this product may be resolved into the sum of two terms.

Integrating (c.), we get -i(i+j i) sin2 /I -P sin2 i(/1-i2sin 108.) Now if we multiply together the imaginary parameters (i2+ijV -l) and (i2J-jV ), their product is i2, or the parameters are reciprocal. Since the parameters are each affected with a negative sign, and one is equal to i2 + a certain quantity, while the other is equal to i2a certain quantity, the former parameter is of the circular form, while the other is of the logarithmic form. It is very remarkable, that although the spherical parabola is a spherical conic, the imaginary parameters satisfy the criterion of conjugation which belongs to the logarithmic form, and not that which belongs to the circular form. Let m i i(i-iV21), n=i(i+jV _T). These values of m and n satisfy the equation of logarithmic conjugation, m+nmnil and not nn-n+mnn-i2, the equation of circular conjugation.

This value of k agrees with that found for k in (96.), or, in other words, when the two spheres coincide, the section of the elliptic cylinder by the sphere is a spherical parabola.

XXXVII. When the cylinder and the paraboloid are given, we may determine the parameter, modulus and constants of the functions which represent the curve of intersection of these surfaces, in the terms of the constants a, b and k. The modulus parameter, coefficients and criterion of sphericity may be expressed, as linear products of constants, having simple relations with those of the given surfaces.

XXXVIII. In the preceding investigations the element Fig. 14. of the curve has been taken as a side of a limiting rectilinear polygon inscribed within it. We may however effect the rectification of the curve, starting from other VI elementary principles. Let APB be the plane base of the x elliptic cylinder, and let a series of normal planes PP'Yv' ss'vv' be drawn to the cylinder, indefinitely near to each other, and parallel to its axis. We may conceive of every element Pw of this plane ellipse between the normal planes as the projection of the corresponding element sw' of the logarithmic ellipse. LetX be the inclination of the ,A_______ element dE of the logarithmic ellipse to the corresponding element ds of the plane ellipse.

Accordingly let P'+Q' sin2X+R' sin4X=( +( sin2x)(r-0 sin2A). (149.) Writing z, 3, y instead of A, B, C, and following step by step the investigation in Art.

As cy=a2k2, P3=a2-b2,andy--a=a2_b2-k2, (151.) we shall have the following relations between the constants an, 3, y, m, in and A, B, C, n, i, in (150.) and (128.), P=B, a=C-B, yrA+B, z+7=A+C, I y-j=A, m+f3=C, y-cx-P+C-A-B=0,.(152.) ~(c4+ey) B(A+C) *2 * B i,-7^(a+p)-(A+B)CIor i,=z, m~+ C Hence the moduli are the same in the two forms of integration, and the parameters m and n will be found to be connected by the equation m+n-mn=i2; . . (153.) m and n are, therefore, conjugate parameters, as they fulfil the condition assumed in (1.). The amplitudes p and 4' are equal.

(159.) If we now make SA=, and subtract the two latter equations, one from the other, the resulting equation will become :S-E-S. . (160.) But this integral is, we know, the expression for an arc of a common parabola, whose semi-parameter is k, measured from the vertex of the curve, to a point on it, where its tangent makes the angle l with the ordinate. Thus the difference between two elliptic arcs measured from the vertices of the curve, which in the plane ellipse may, as we know, be expressed by a right line; and in the spherical ellipse by an arc of a circle, as shown in Art. XV.; will in the logarithmic ellipse be expressed by an arc of a parabola. As a parabolic arc can be rectified only by a logarithm, we may hence see the propriety of the term logarithmic, by which this function is designated. XXXIX. If from the vertex A of a paraboloid, an arc of a parabola be drawn, at right angles to a parabolic section of the paraboloid, it will meet this parabolic section at its vertex. Let the arc AQ be drawn at right angles Fig. 15. to the parabolic section Qv of the paraboloid, the point Q is the vertex of the parabola Qv. A Draw QT and Qt tangents to the arcs QA and Qv. Then QT and Qt are at right angles. As QT is a tangent to a principal section passing through the axis of the paraboloid, it will meet this axis in a point T;. and as Qt is a tangent to' the surface of the paraboloid, it will be perpendicular to the \ normal to the surface QN. Now as Qt is perpendicular to QT and to QN, it is perpendicular to the plane QTN which passes through them, and therefore to every line in this 7? plane, and therefore to the axis AN, or to any line parallel to it, as the diameter Qn. Hence, as the tangent Qt to the parabola Qv is perpendicular to the diameter Qn, Q is the vertex of the parabola. Hence in the logarithmic ellipse, one extremity of the protangent arc is always the vertex of the parabola which touches the logarithmic ellipse at its other extremity. DR. BOOTH ON THE GEOMETRICAL PROPERTIES OF ELLIPTIC INTEGRALS. 353 This is a very important theorem, as the protangents are arcs of equal parabolas, all measured from the vertices of the parabolas. Hence also the length of the protangent arc depends solelv on its normal angle. As an arc of a circle may be expressed by the notation s=sin '(), y being the ordi-. nate and k the radius, so in like manner an arc of a parabola may be designated by the form s-tan Q'); y being the ordinate and k the semiparameter. To distinguish the parabolic arc from the circular arc, the former may be written s=,rm'l(). Again, as we say, in the case of the circle, the angle w and the arc kw, w being the angle contained between the normals to the curve at the extremities of the arc: so in the parabola, we may write o for the angle between the normals, and (k.o) for the corresponding parabolic arc. In the case of the parabola the are is always supposed to be measured from the vertex; in the circle the arc may be measured from any point, as every point is a vertex. XL. Resuming the equation (157.), O= d7VP+lsi'+R'sin4-k2 We shall now proceed to develope the first integral of the second side of this equation. As the integral is precisely the same in form as (123.), and the amplitude +-=P as also the modulus i,=i-, we may substitute ot, 3, y for A, B, C, m for n, (D. for O., retaining the modulus and amplitude, which continue unchanged, as we have established in (152.) and (154.); or substituting for a, P, y their values in m and i, we get 2 [i2 + 2m] E; _ [i2 + mo-2m] c d_ 1 A/M(j2_M)(l-m) km m J-1SiA2<] /l-2 Sin2,g (6 [i2-m] dp 2 [i2+m_-2m]2 ('ch-J -4 +Un Vm(i2_ m)(1-m)ico&T) If we eliminate i from the coefficients of (133.) and (161.), putting M for (1 -im sin2p), and N for (1-n sin2p), as also jT for Vii2sn (133.) will becoen 2(nz-m) , +(I-n)(n-m)f d; m d r Vn(X n + N VT+n(1_) nS I+Sd/In . .

This is case IV. of the Table, p. 316. We cannot arrive at this limiting expression by making e2=m=O in (53.) for this supposition would render i=O, which, throughout these investigations, is assumed to be invariable. XLIII. If, as in the case of the spherical parabola, we make n=m, or n=1/1the values of a and k become infinite. What, then, is the meaning of the elliptic integral of the logarithmic form of the third order, when n=m, or n= I1i2? In the circular form of the third order, when m=n, n=i, and the spherical ellipse becomes the spherical parabola, which, as we know, may be rectified by an elliptic 0 ~~~~~~~b integral of the first order. Not only do the ratios la k become infinite, but they beh2 1-n come equal, for I= 1, when m=n. What, then, does the integral in this case signify? It does not become imaginary or change its species.

This is the expression for the length of an arc of a logarithmic ellipse, the intersection of a cylinder, now become circular, with a paraboloid whose semiparameter k=0 therefore the dimensions of the paraboloid being indefinitely diminished in magnitude, this intersection of a finite circular cylinder by a paraboloid indefinitely attenuated, must take place at an infinite altitude. We naturally should suppose that the section of a cylinder which indefinitely approaches in its limit to a circular cylinder, by a paraboloid of revolution, would be a circle; yet the fact is not so. The intersection of these surfaces, instead of being a circle, is a logarithmic ellipse, whose rectification may be effected by an elliptic integral of the second order, as we shall now proceed to show. In the first place let us conceive the paraboloid as of definite magnitude, and the cylinder to be elliptical; its semiaxes as before being a and b. Then as a and b are the ordinates of a parabola, at the points where the elliptic cylinder meets the paraboloid, at its greatest and least distances from the axis of the surfaces, we shall have a2-=2kz' b2=2kz ".(178.) Hence a2-b2=2k(z'-z"). Let z'-z"=h, then h is the thickness or height of that portion of the cylinder within which the logarithmic ellipse is contained. k2mn kmn Now (171.) gives a -b =nm, *2hn=X_ and we have also ad V4/mn(l -in), hence h=a */inn n-m 2 /1-rM Now when n=m, a=b, k=0, while we get for h a n h=a2.X(179.) We thus arrive at this most remarkable result, that though the cylinder changes from elliptic to circular, while the parameter of the paraboloid approximates to its limiting value 0, yet the thickness of the zone, that is k, does not also indefinitely diminish, but assumes the limiting value given above. Now if we cut this circular cylinder, the radius of whose base is a, by a plane DR.

Accordingly, in the two forms of the third order, when the conjugate parameters are equal, or m=n, the representative curves of those forms become the spherical parabola, and the circular logarithmic ellipse. This is Case V. in the Table, p. 316. The results of the preceding investigation will reappear in the d emonstration of the theorem, that quadrants of the spherical or logarithmic ellipse may be expressed by the help of integrals of the first and second orders.

The Logarithmic hyperbola may be defined as the curve of symmetrical intersection of a paraboloid of revolution with a right cylinder standing on a plane hyperbola as a base. Let Oxx, be a paraboloid of revoluFig. 16. tion, whose vertex is at 0, and whose z axis is OZ. Let ACB be an hyperbola in the plane of xy, whose vertex is at A, whose asymptots are the lines OX, ' OY, and whose axis is the right line \ OAD. Let the planes ZOX, ZOD, \\ ZOY cut the paraboloid in the plane parabolas Ox, Od, Gy, and let cab be the curve on the surface of the para-> boloid whose orthogonal projection on _____x the plane of xsy is the plane hyperbola ABC. Then acb is the logarithmic hyperbola. As OX is an asymptot to the hyperbolic arc AB, it is manifest that the parabolic arc Ox is a curvilinear asymptot to the arc ab of the logarithmic hyperbola. Let we -=-l, and S2+y2= 2kz.(220.) be the equations of the hyperbolic cylinder and of the paraboloid of revolution, and consequently of the curve in which they intersect. Let T be an arc of this curve, (I r4\2 'd\2 2dz It then T=jd i.[(d ) + + dAJJ.(221.) x, y, z being functions of a fourth independent variable A.

Let tanO'=u, and the resulting equation will be of the form dY a+gu S+YU4 duV AA+Bu +Cu4+Du6 an expression which, on trial, it would be found very difficult to reduce.

BOOTH ON THE GEOMETRICAL PROPERTIES OF ELLIPTIC INTEGRALS. 365 I and n are reciprocal parameters, the reader will recollect, while m and n are conjugate parameters. XLVII. It was shown in(226.), that C-A=a2+b2-k2, B=a2+b2, k2=A+B-C, and a'k2=AC, whence a2 AC b2 (A+B)(B-C) k2 (A+B-C)2' k2 (A+B-C)2 (245.) In order that these values of a and b may be real, we must have B > C, and A of the same sign with C, both positive, otherwise </V in (225.) will be imaginary. As 1= A+B1> 1; here the parameter I is greater than 1, while m and n are each less than 1. We may express the semniaxes of the hyperbola, the base of the hyperbolic cylinder, in terms of the modulus i and the parameter 1; for by the equations immediately preceding we may eliminate A, B and C in (243.). We thus find a2 1i2(1l1)(1 i2) b2 (1-1)(l-i2)2 X2 [2 + i2_ 26i2]' c2=[12+2-21i22.) therefore ~~~B a2?h2 1(1-i1) therefore B~a 2 12 ? i2 li2 (247.)

When n=m, the above expression becomes illusory. We shall, however, in the next article find a remarkable value for the arc of the logarithmic hyperbola, when m=n.

This equation gives at once the ratio between the axes of the hyperbolic and elliptic cylinders.

The parameters are reciprocal in this equation, being 1 and i2. Now this is the extreme case of the formula for the comparison of elliptic integrals of the third order and logarithmic form. We perceive that this formula results from the comparison of two expressions for the same are of a common hyperbola. We may also see that it is the limiting case of the general formula for the comparison of elliptic integrals of the third order having reciprocal parameters; a formula which in like manner has been deduced from the comparison of two expressions for the same are of the logarithmic hyperbola. It is also evident that j2 tan being the difference between tan q!,/I and s it is the difference between tangents, one drawn to the hyperbola, the other to the plane ellipse, for tanpV/I denotes the portion of a tangent to a hyperbola between the point of contact and the perpendicular on it from the centre; and CiO2 f denotes a similar quantity in an ellipse; this difference is precisely analogous to the expression which occurs in (284.) cos3u djcosT' which denotes the difference between two parabolic arcs, one drawn a tangent to the logarithmic hyperbola, the other a tangent to the logarithmic ellipse. SECTION VIL.-On the Values of complete Elliptic Integrals of the third order. LIII. We have hitherto investigated the properties and lengths of elliptic curves, on the supposition that the generating surface, whether sphere or paraboloid, was invariable, and that the lengths of the curves were made up by the summation of the elements produced by the successive values given to the amplitude p between certain limits, 0 and 2 suppose, if the arcs are to be quadrants. Thus the length of the quadrant is obtained, by adding together the successive increments which result from the successive additions, indefinitely small, which are made to the amplitude. We may, however, proceed on another principle to effect the rectification of those curves. If, to fix our ideas, we want to determine the length of a quadrant of the spherical ellipse, we may imagine the vertical cylinder, which we shall suppose invariable, to be successively intersected by a series of all possible concentric spheres. Every quadrant will differ in length from the one immediately preceding it in the series, by an infinitesimal quantity; and if we take the least of these quadrants, and add to it the successive elements, by which one quadrant differs from the next immediately preceding, we shall thus obtain the length of a quadrant of the required spherical ellipse, equal to the least quadrant which can be described on the elliptic cylinder, plus the sum of all the elements between the least quadrant and the required one. Thus, for example, the least quadrant which can be drawn on an elliptic vertical cylinder, is its section by an horizontal plane, or a quadrant of the plane ellipse, DR. BOOTH ON THE GEOMETRICAL PROPERTIES OF ELLIPTIC INTEGRALS. 375 whose semiaxes are a and b. In this case the radius of the sphere is infinite. The least sphere is that whose radius is a, and which cuts the cylinder in its circular sections. Hence the greatest spherical elliptic quadrant is the quadrant of the circle whose radius is a. All the spherical elliptic quadrants will therefore be comprised between the quadrants of an ellipse, and of a circle whose radius is a. Any quadrant therefore of a given spherical ellipse is equal to a quadrant of a plane ellipse, plus a certain increment; or to a quadrant of a circle, minus a certain decrement. The same reasoning will hold as well when we take any other limits, besides 0 and 22 These considerationsnaturally lead to the process of differentiation under the sign of integration? because we cannot express, under a finite known form, the arc of a spherical or logarithmic ellipse, and then differentiate the expression so found, with respect to a quantity which hitherto has been taken as a constant. We may conceive the generation of successive curves of this kind to take place in another manner. Let us imagine an invariable sphere! to be cut by a succession of concentric cylinders indefinitely near to each other, and generated after a given law. These cylinders will cut the sphere in a series of spherical ellipses, anyone of which will differ from the one immediately preceding, by an indefinitely small quantity. If we sum all these indefinitely small quantities, or in other words, integrate; the expression so found, we shall discover the finite difference between any two curves of the series separated by a finite interval. One of the limits being a known curve, the other may thus be determined. To apply this reasoning. In the following investigations we shall assume the generating sphere to be invariiable, and the modulus i, with the'amplitude p to be constant. 'The intersecting cylinder we shall suppose to vary from curve to curve on the surface of the sphere. a2bA But i is constant, and i2= , see (27.). Now a and b being the semiaxes of the base of the cylinder, it follows that the bases of all the varying cylinders are concentric and similar ellipses. Hence in the elliptic integral of the third order, which represents the spherical ellipse, the parameter e2 or m, and the criterion of sphericity Vzwill vary.

In the preceding case, that of the spherical ellipse, the analogous formula expresses the sum of the arcs of two inverse spherical ellipses, whose amplitudes are the same. LV. We shall use the term inverse spherical ellipses to denote curves whose representative elliptic integrals have reciprocal parameters. The terms reciprocal and supplemental have long since been appropriated to curves otherwise related. Let a and 3, a, and 3, denote the principal semiarcs of two such curves. Since the modulus i is the same in both integrals, the orthogonal projections of these curves, on the base of the hemisphere, are similar ellipses. (15.) gives 2 ~~~ ~~~~~~~~2 2 2 e =i'sec2p, e'=:i sec2f3,, and we assume e e =i2. Hence secp secp31i= 1. . (315.)

Now we have shown in (59.) that when the principal arcs of a spherical hyperconic section are so related, the curve is the spherical parabola, or when the curve becomes its own inverse, it is the spherical parabola. sinlL sin~j Sill3 sin1S We have shown in (15.) that i2= sjn-ct2 but (3.) gives cos_= s being the angle between the cyclic arcs of the spherical ellipse. Hence i=sinn, but i is constant. Therefore all inverse spherical ellipses have the same cyclic arcs. That portion of the surface of a sphere which lies between the cyclic circles may be called the clyclic area. The spherical parabola divides the cyclic area into two regions. In the one, between the pole and the spherical parabola, lie all the inverse curves, whose parameters range from, i2 to i. In the other, between the spherical parabola and the cyclic circles, lie all the conjugate inverse curves, whose parameters range from i to 1. Let acb, adb be the cyclic circles, the interFig. 17. section of the sphere by an elliptic cylinder, whose transverse axe is equal to the diameter -/ --of the sphere, and whose rmnor axe is 2j.

The reader must have observed the importance of this curve, the spherical parabola, in the discussion of the geometrical theory of elliptic integrals. We may determine the principal arcs of two inverse spherical ellipses by a simple geometrical construction. Let AZB be a vertical section of the hemisphere, on which Fig. 19. the curves are to be described. Let F be the focus of the elliptic base of the maximum cylinder, whose principal transverse axis is accordingly equal to the diameter of the sphere. Join OZ, FZ, and draw ZC at right angles to ZF, meeting the line AO in C. Produce ZO until OD=AC, and on OD as diameter describe a circle. We are required, give one principal arc Za, to determine the corresponding principal arc Za' of the inverse hyperconic. Draw the tangent ZG. Through a draw DR.

But ZG'=k tana,, hence tana tanai=1, or the arcs a and a, are connected by the equation established in (317.). When we require to know which of these successive curves on this sphere is the spherical parabola, the same construction will enable us to determine it. Draw ZT, a tangent to the circle on OD, take ZT' ZT"-ZT, and join T' and T" with 0 cutting the sphere in c and c'.

Neither should we be justified in making i=O, (as some writers do), for this would be to violate the original supposition-and all the conclusions derived from it-namely, that i is constant, and less than 1. Moreover, since m+nu-mn=i2-O, on this hypothesis, mn+n=mn; or m and n would each be greater than 1, which is inconsistent with the possible values of those quantities. We have now to determine the value of the constant. In these investigations we have all along supposed n > m. The least value n can have is n=m. Were we to suppose n to be, less than rn, it would be nothing more than to write m for n, since m and n are connected bv the equation m+n-nn=i2. Hence if m is not equal to n, one of them must be the greater, and this one we agree to call n, writing m for the lesser. To determine the constant, let us assume n=m.

The preceding formula will become, on substituting these values, and dividing by V-i sin'fsin cosZ'+5sin' cosP', the well-known trigonometrical expression for the sine of the sum of two circular arcs. Hence, by the aid of imaginary transformations, we may interchangeablypermute the formul of the trigonometry of the circle with those of the trigonometry of the parabola. In the trigonometry of the circle, w=p+X, and in the trigonometry of the parabola a is such a function of the angles p and X, as will render tan[(p,X)]=tanp secy+tany secp. We must adopt some appropriate notation to represent this function. Let the function (., X) be written FIX, so that tan(;-LX)=tanpsecX+tan secp. This must be taken as the definition of the function p-'-z. In like manner, we may represent by tan(p-ry,) the function tang secytanysece.

If we call an arc measured from the vertex of a parabola an apsidal arc, to distinguish it fornm an arc taken anywhere along the parabola, the preceding theorem 388 DR. BOOTH ON THE GEOMETRICAL PROPERTIES OF ELLIPTIC INTEGRALS. will enable us to express an arc of a parabola, taken anywhere along the curve, as the sum or difference of an apsidal arc and a right line. Thus let ACD be a parabola, 0 its focus Fig. 21. and A its vertex. Let AB=(k.p), AC=(k.h), AD=(k.a) andYY--Y =h. Then(343.)showsthattlhe parabolic arc (AC+AB)=apsidal are AD-h; and the parabolic arc (AD-AB)=BD=apsidal arc AC+h. When the arcs AC', AB' together constitute a focal arc, or an arc whose cord passes through the focus, pl+X=and h is the ordinate of the conjugate arc AD. Hence we derive this theorem, Anyfocal arc of a parabola is equal to the difference between the conjugate apsidal arc and its ordinate. The relation between the amplitudes p and w in this case is sin2p=1 Thus when the focal cord makes an angle of 300 with the axis, we get cost=I, or y=5k. H-ere therefore the ordinate of the conjugate arc is five times the semiparameter. LX. We m ay, in all cases, represent by a simple geometrical construction, the ordinates of the conjugate parabolic arcs, whose amplitudes are p, X and w. Let ABC be a parabola whose focus is Fig. 22. k 0,andwhosevertexisA. LetAOG moreover let AB be the arc whose amplitude is p, and AC the arc whose amplitude is X. At the points A, B, C ddraw tangents to the parabola, they \ will form a triangle circumscribing the A parabola, whose sides represent the semi-ordinates of the conjugate arcs, AB, AC, AD. We know that the circle, circumscribing this triangle, passes through the focus of the parabola. Now Abzg tang, Ac=g tanX, bd=g tanp secX, cd=g tanX sec; hence bd+ cd=g (tan p see X + tan X see p), therefore g tan = bd+ cd. When AB, AC together constitute a focal arc, the angle bdc is a right angle. DR. BOOTH ON THE GEOMETRICAL PROPERTIES OF ELLIPTIC INTEGRALS. 389 The diameter of this circle is gsecp secX. The demonstration of these properties follows obviously from the figure. LXI. In the trigonometry of the circle, we find the formula tan3.~ tan5.~ tan7.5 a tanS 3 +-5 7+&c ........ . (a.) and if we develop, by common division, the expression 1 cos0 c cO=l .-sin2O cos0(l+sin20+sin40+sin60+ .... &c.) and integrate, Cdo sin'l30 sinW0 sin7O ossin0+3 +++...&c. (b.) If we now inquire, what, in the circle, is the arc which differs from its protangent, by the distance between the vertex and its focus; or, as the protangent is 0 in the circle, and the focus is the centre; the question may be changed into what is the trigonometrical tangent of the are of a circle equal to the radius. This question is answered by putting I for a in (a.), and reverting the series 1 = ~tan ( 3 a(l) __tan,5(1) _tan7 (l) +&. we should get, in functions of the numbers of BERNOUILLI, the value of tan(l), as is shown in most treatises on trigonometry. Let us now make a like inquiry in the case of the parabola, and ask what is the value of the amplitude which will give the difference, between the arc of the parabola and its protangent, equal to the distance between the focus and the vertex of the parabola. Now if 0 be this angle, we must have (k . 0)-g see 0 tan 0=g. But in general, (k. 0) -g sec 0 tan 0=gyC.. Hence we must have, in this case, .,= 1. If we now revert the series (b.), putting I for Jo A we shall get from this particular value of the series, sin3O sin50 sin7O h=sinO+ 5 7 an arithmetical value for sin0. This will be found to be, sin0=' +e-1 e being the base of the Napierian logarithms. hence seco+ tan0=e, or if we write e for this particular value of 0 to distinguish it from every other, and call it the angle of the base, sece+ tan c=e. (345.) We are thus (for the first time it is believed) put in possession of the geometrical origin of that quantity, so familiarly known to mathematicians, the Napierian base. From the above equations we may derive el +e-1 el-e-l sece= 2 ,tanse 2 (346.) or tane=1V175203015, whence e=*8657606, or e=490. 36'. 15". The corresponding arc of the parabola will be (k.0)=k[1 + +j -45 +&c.]. (347.) 390 DR. BOOTH ON THE GEOMETRICAL PROPERTIES OF ELLIPTIC INTEGRALS. If we assume the theory of logarithms as known, we may at once arrive at this value, for in general , log (sec0+ tan 0); and as this is to be 1, we mnust have sec0+ tan0=e, as before. LXII. If we now extend this inquiry, and ask, what is the magnitude of the amplitude of the arc of the parabola which shall render the difference between the parabolic arc and its protangent equal to n times the distance between the focus and the vertex; we shall have, as before, by the terms of the question, (k. 0)-g secO tanO=ng. (348.) But in general (k. 0) -g secO tano-gJ' dO hence we must have n =J,0o=iog(sec0+tanG), or sec0+ tanO=e". (349.) Now we may solve this equation in two ways; either by mAking n a given number, and then determine the value of sec0+tan0, which may be called the base. Or we may assign an arbitrary value to sec0+tanO, and then derive the value of n. Taking the latter course, let, for example, sec0+tan0= 10. Then n=loglO, orI is the modulus of the second system of logarithms. Hence, if we assume any number of systems of logarithms on the same parabola, and take their bases g(sec0+ tanG), g(sec0' + tanl'), g(secG"+ tan0"), .. .&c. the moduli of these successive systems will be the ratios of hayf the semiparameter to the successive differences between the base parabolic arcs and their protangents. In the Napierian system, g the distance from the focus to the vertex of the parabola, is taken as 1. The difference between the parabolic arc and its protangent, when equal to g, gives g(sec0+tanO)=eg. In the decimal system g(sec0,+tan0,)log, and the difference between the corresponding parabolic arc and its protangent being ng, if we make this difference ng equal to the arithmetical unit, we shall have ng= 1, or g=-=modulus of the system. Hence in every system of logarithms whatever, g the distance between the focus and the vertex of the parabola, is the modulus of the system. Every system of logarithms may be derived from the same parabola, but the Napierian system, in which the focal distance of the vertex is itself taken as the unit, may justly be taken as the natural system. In the same way we may consider that to be the natural system of circular trigonometry, in which the radius is taken as the unit. The modulus, in the trigonometry of the parabola, corresponds with the radius in the trigonometry of the circle. But while in the trigonometry of the parabola the base is real, in the circle it is 'imaginary. In the parabola, the angle of the base is given by the equation sec0+tan0=e. In1 tie circle coAs+VIsin &LV1, and DR. BOOTH ON THE GEOMETRICAL PROPERTIES OF ELLIPTIC INTEGRALS. 391 making Y=1, we get cos(1)+V--1 sin(1)=eV=1. Hence while el is the parabolic base, e"'= is the circular base. Or as [sece+ tane] is the Napierian base, [cos(lI)+ "-l sin(l)] is the circular or imaginary base. Thus [Cos(l) +N/Sin(].)?=co~s5+N/I sin5. Hence, speaking more precisely, imaginary numbers have real logarithms, but an imaginary base. We may always pass from the real logarithms of the parabola, to the imaginary logarithms of the circle, by changing tanO into /-1 sini, secO into cosa, and el into ewl. As in the parabola the angle 0 is non-periodic, its limit being+, while in the circle a has no limit, it follows that while a number can have only one real or parabolic logarithm, it may have innumerable imaginary or circular logarithms. In the parabola we thus can shiow the geometrical origin of the magnitudes known as the base and the modulus. We might too form systems of circular trigonometry analogous to different systems of logarithms. We might refer the arc of a circle not to the radius, but to some other arbitrary fixed line, the diameter or any other suppose. Let the circumference be referred to the diameter, then X will signify a whole circumference instead of a semicircle, and 4 will represent a right angle. Having on this system, or any similar one, found the lengths of the arcs which correspond to certain functions, such as given sines or tangents, we should multiply the results by some fixed number, which we might call a modulus (2 in this example), to reduce them to the standard system; but such systems would obviously be useless. If e be the angle which gives the difference between the parabolic arc and its protangent equal to g= k; (ew-e) is the angle which will give this difference equal to 2g, (e-L -) is the angle which will give this difference equal to 3g, and so on to any number of angles. Hence, in the circle, if 5 be the angle which gives the circular arc equal to the radius, 25 is the angle which will give an arc equal to twice the radius, and so on for any number of angles. This is of course self-evident in the case of the circle, but it is instructive to point out the complete analogy which holds in the trigonometries of the circle and of the parabola. LXIII. The geometrical origin of the exponential theorem may thus be shown. Assume two known logarithmic bases (secov+tano), and (sec!3+tanf3), and let us investigate the ratio of the differences of the corresponding parabolic arcs and their protangents. Let sece+ tane be the Napierian base, and let one difference be xvg and the other yg. The ratio of these differences is therefore =z, if we make y-As. Hence secz+tan%=(sece+tane)xtex, and (seci3+tanf3)=eY. Therefore (seco +tan)Y=e+Y=(secf+tanf)*. Or, as y=xz, (secoc+tans)z= secs +tan03. MDCCCLII.3 392 DR. BOOTH ON THE GEOMETRICAL PROPERTIES OF ELLIPTIC INTEGRALS. Let A be the first base, and B the second. Then B=.AM. This is the exponential theorem. Let A be the Napierian base, then x=l, and A=e. Hence B=e-. LXIV. Given the number to find its logarithm, may be exhibited by the following geometrical construction. Let OAP be a parabola. Through the focus Odraw Fig. 23. the perpendicular OQ to the axis AO. Through A let a tangent of indefinite length be drawn. On this tangent Q take the line AN to represent the given number. Join NO, and make the angle NOT always equal to the angle T / NOQ. Draw TP at right angles to TO. This line will touch the parabola in the point P, and the arc of the A parabola AP-PT will be the logarithm of AN. A-O When AN'=AO=the unit g, the angle N'OQ is equal T to half a right angle. Hence the point T in this case will coincide with A. The parabolic arc therefore vanishes, or the logarithm of 1 is 0. When sec0+ tan0=l, 0=0. When the number is less than 1, the point N will fall below N' in the position n. Hence nOQ is greater than half a right angle. Therefore T will fall below the axis in the point T'I; and if we draw through T' a tangent rT it will give the negative arc of the parabola T'p, corresponding to the number An. Fractional numbers, or numbers between +1 and 0, must therefore be represented by the expression g(sec0tan 0), since tanG changes its sign. When the number is 0, n coincides with A, and the angle NOQ in this case is a right angle. Therefore the point T' will be the intersection of AT' and OQ. Hence Tr' is at an infinite distance below the axis, and therefore the logarithm of +0 is -o Hence negative numbers have no logarithms, at least no real ones; and imaginary ones can only be educed by the transformation so often referred to, and this leads us to seek them among the properties of the circle. For as 0 always lies between 0 and a right angle, or between 0 and the half of +, sec0+tan0 is altwlays positive; hence negative numbers can have no real or parabolic logarithms, but they may have imaginary or circular logarithms; for in the expression log (cos+V:-1 sina) =V/-1 we may maake a= (2n+ I ) , and we shall get log (1 )= (2n+ 1 )zvT 1. hence also, as the length of the parabolic arc TP, without reference to the sign, depends solely on the amplitude 0, it follows that the logarithm of sec0tanO is equal to the logarithm of sec0+ tan 0. As (sec 0+ tan0)(sec0tan0)= 1, we may hence infer, that the logarithm of any number is equal to the logarithm. of its reciprocal> with the sign changed. When 0 is very large, sec0+tan0=2 tang, nearly. Hence if we represent a large number by an ordinate of a parabola whose focal distance to the vertex is 1, the difference between the corresponding arc and its protangents will represent its logarithm. Aloneg the tangent to the vertex of the parabola, as in the preceding figure, draws, DR. BOOTH ON THE GEOMETRICAL PROPERTIES OF ELLIPTIC INTEGRALS. 393 measured from the vertex, a series of lines in geometrical progression, g (secO+ tanO), g (secO+ tanO)2, g (secO+ tanO)3 ...... g (secO+ tanO)f. Join N, the general representative of the extremities of these right lines, with the focus 0. Erect the perpendicular OQ, and make the angle NOT always equal to the angle NOQ. The line QT will be =g sec, the line OT,=g see (OJL O), the line OT,=g see (OLO OL0), &c., and we shall likewise have AT=-getanO, AT,=g tan (O0-), AT,,=g tan (0--L0--0), &c. This follows immediately from (342.); for any integral power of (secO+ tanO) may be exhibited as a linear function of see 0+ tan ?, if (D=O-O-0 ..O. &c., since see (OLG10.O-L.O 0 &c. to nO)+tan (0OL-O I1O-.O &c. to nO) =(sec0+tanO) . Hence the parabola enables us to give a graphical construction for the angle (O-LO.I&c.) as the circle does for the angle nO. The analogous theorem in the circle may Fig. 24. be developed as follows:-In the circle OBA, (fig.24)takethearcsAB=BB =B B =B B * ...&e.=2. Letthe diameter be G. Then OB = G cosS, OB, =G cos2, OB,, G cos3i*/. &c. and AB =Gsina, AB,=G sin2aAB, G Now as the lines in the second group are always at right angles to those in the first, A and as such a change is denoted bythe symbol 1/ we-get OB+BA=G (cosY+V/I sins), OB,+BA=G (cos2+VZ-1 sin22)=G (cosa+ V-I sin )2; OBII+BJIA=G(cos3+?VI sin3) =G(cosa+V/-1 sina)3&c. LXV. The known theorem, that a parabola is the reciprocal polar of a circle, whose circumference passes through the focus, suggests a transformation, which will exhibit a much closer analogy between the forinuiae for the rectification of the parabola and the circle, than when the centre of the latter curve is taken as the origin. Let OBA be a semicircle, let the origin be placed at 0, let the angle AOB=5, and let G, as before, be the diameter of the circle. Through B draw the tangent BP; let fall on this tangent the perpendicular OP=p, and let BP the protangent be equal to t. Now as p=G cos'2, and t=G sina costs, as also the angle AOP=2a, if we apply to the circle the formula for rectification in (33.), we shall have the arc AB=s=2Gjcos2'da-.G sinscosa. Make the imaginary transformations cos5= sec0, and sin=V/I tan0, and we _____ j dO shall have (=2tfcg -_se 0 tanO. The expression for an arc of a parabola, diminished by its protangent. 3 E 2 394 DR. BOOTH ON THE GEOMETRICAL PROPERTIES OF ELLIPTIC INTEGRALS. The protangent to the circle, which is exhibited in this formula, disappears in the actual process of integration; while in the parabola, the protangent which is involved in the differential, is evolved by the process of integration. As in the parabola, the perpendicular, from the focus on the tangent, bisects the angle between the radius vector and the axis of the curve; so in the circle, the radius vector OB drawn from the extremity of the diameter, bisects the angle between the perpendicular OP and the diameter OA. There are somne curious analogies between the parabola and the circle, considered under this point of view. In the parabola, the points T, T,, T,,, which divide the lines g (secO+ tan0), g [sec(0-L0)+tan(04L0)], &c. into their component parts, are upon tangents to the parabola. The corresponding points B, B,, X,, in the circle, are on the circumference of the circle. In the parabola the extremities of the lines g (secO+ tanO) are on a right line AN; in the circle, the extremities of the bent lines G (cos2+4V-I sins) are all in the point A. The locus of the point T, the intersections of the tangents to the parabola with the perpendiculars from the focus, is a right line; or in other words, while one end of a protangent rests on the parabola, the other end rests on a right line. So in the circle, while one end of the protangent rests on the circle, the other end rests on a cardioide, whose diameter is equal to that of the circle, and whose cusp is at 0. OPP,A is the cardioide. The length of the tangent AT to any point T is g tanO. The length of the cardioide. is 2G sins. It is singular that the imaginary formulae in trigonometry have long been discovered, while the corresponding real expressions have escaped notice. Indeed, it was long ago observed by LAMBERT, and by other geometers-the remark has been repeated in almost every treatise on the subject since-that the ordinates of an equilateral hyperbola might be expressed by real exponentials, whose exponents are sectors of the hyperbola; but the analogv, being illusory, never led to any useful results. And the analogy was illusory from this, that it so happens the length and area of a circle are expressed by the same function, while the area of an equilateral hyperbola is a function of an are of a parabola. The true analogue of the circle is the parabola. LXV1.

We are thus enabled to assign the difference between an arc of a parabola and three times another arc, e If in (m) (341.) we make p=4', tanw=4 tan'@+ tan@. Introduce into this expression, the imaginary transformation tan =V-i sin 0, and we shall get sin3O= -4 sin30+ sinG, which is the known formula for the trisection of a circular are. (351.) may therefore be taken as the formula which gives the trisection of an arc of a parabola. When there are five parabolic arcs, whose normal angles P. , As v, f are related as above, namely, we get the following relation, (k.fl) (k. )-(k.X)-(k .0)-k(k.v) =k tan(p xL yJv) tan(, Al~ -Lv) tan(-1p -v), (352.) a formula which connects five parabolic arcs, whose amplitudes are derived by the given law. We might pursue this subject very much further; but enough has been done to show the analogy which exists between the trigonometry of the circle and that of the parabola. As the calculus of angular magnitude has always been referred to the circle as its type, so the calculus of logarithms may, in precisely the same way, be referred to the parabola as its type. The obscurities, which hitherto have hung over the geometrical theory of logarithms, have it is hoped been now removed. It is possible to represent logarithms, as elliptic integrals usually have been represented, by curves devised to exhibit some special property only; and accordingly, such curves, while they place before us the properties they have been constructed to represent, fail generally to carry us any further. The close analogies which connect the theory of logarithms with the properties of the circle will no longer appear inexplicable*. * The views above developed, on the trigonometry of the parabola, throw much light on a controversy long carried on between LEIBNlTz and J. BERNOULLI on the subject of the logarithms of negative numbers. LEIBNITZ insisted they were imaginary, while BERNOULLI argued they were real, and the same as the logarithms of equal positive numbers. EULER espoused the side of the former, while D'ALEMBERT coincided with the views of BERNOULLI. Indeed, if we derive the theory of logarithms from the properties of the hyperbola (as geometers always have done), it will not be easy satisfactorily to answer the argument of BERNOULLI-that as an hyperbolic area represents the logarithm of a positive number, denoted by the positive abscissa + x, so a negative number, according to conventional usage, being represented by the. negative abscissa -x, the corresponding hyperbolic area should denote its logarithm also. All this obscurity is cleared up by the theory developed in the te~xt, which completely establishes the correctness of the views of LEXBNITZ and EULER. 396 DR.

Comparing these equations (a.) and (b.) together, we get P-i dw dd rdX Now as the triangle RR'P is a quadrantal right-angled triangle, the relation between the angles AFR, BER', or p and X, is easily discovered. Since FPE is a spherical triangle right-angled at P. and FE=2e=2-y, we getj tang tanX= I. When AQ=BQ, P=X, and tan@= He The locus of the point P is a spherical ellipse, supplemental to the former, having the extremities of its principal minor arc, in the foci F, E of the former. LXVIII.

This will be shown by proving that the vector arcs, drawn from the centre of the curve to the extremities of the compared arcs, have the same inclination to the principal arc 2.

LXXIV. To determine the inclination, to the horizontal plane, of the tangent drawn to any point of the spherical ellipse. The spherical ellipse being taken as the curve of intersection of a cylinder by a sphere as in (X.), through a side Rr of the cylinder let a plane be drawn, it will cut the sphere in a small circle, which will touch the spherical ellipse in the point r, and will cut the base of the hemisphere in the right line RP, which touches the base of the cylinder at the Fig. 26. point R. Let 0 be the centre of the sphere and Z the Z centre of the spherical hyperconic. Through the line OZ let a plane be drawn at right angles to the plane of theA small circle RrrP, it will cut the sphere in 'the arc of a great circle Zsr at right angles to the arc r'r; and as the three planes, namely, the horizontal plane, the plane of the small circle, and the plane of the great circle Z0P/r, are mutually at right angles, the right lines in which they intersect PR, Px, PO are mutually at right angles, therefore P is the foot of the perpendicular drawn from the centre 0 of the base of the cylinder, to the tangent RP which touches the curve. P is also the centre of the small circle Armr, since AB is a cord of the sphere. Hence AT is a quadrant, and therefore, rx or v is the inclination of the element of the spherical ellipse at r to the base of the hemisphere. Now ZO is the radius of the sphere, and Pr that of the small circle. RPO is a right angle, and therefore OR'=0P2+PR2. Hence Rrr2=Or2.02. Now for the moment putting A and B for the semniaxes of the base of the cylinder, OP2=A2 cosX+B2sinX, and 2-= (A2B2)2 sin2X, cos2x 2 A4 cos2x, + B4 sin2X R P =A2 Cos2X+ B2 n.

Cosa Let, as in (25.), tanX= cost tanp=Wj~ tanp. Substituting, we get the expression sine sins sin; cosp tan= 4/(1-Si sin2,). * . (390.) In supplemental spherical ellipses, since sinn and sins* are respectively equal to sins' and sinn', we infer, therefore, that in supplemental spherical ellipses the inclinations to the plane of xy of the tangents to the curves are the same, when the amplitudes p are the sarne. If we now differentiate this expression, and make d; = w0 e shall find that tan'o tane3 If we substitute this value of tan p in (390.), we shall get ta2ttano. tany=tan (Q-3), or v=a-3. (391.) Hence the maximijum inclination to the plane of ay of the tangent to the spherical ellipse is equal to the difference between the principal semiarcs. It is remarkable that the point of the curve which gives the maximum difference between the arcs, which together constitute the quadrant of the spherical ellipse, is not the point of greatest inclination. For this point is found by making tan2'=tan ; while the point of maxillmum difference is obtained by putting tan2p=s-i. This is the more worthy 9f notice, as we shall find the two points-the point of maximum division, and the point of greatest inclination-to coincide in the logarithmic ellipse. If we take the two plane ellipses which are the projections of the spherical ellipse, one being the perspective, and the other the orthogonal projection, and seek on these plane ellipses their points of maximum division, we shall find that the angles, which the perpendiculars on the tangents, through these points of maximum division of those plane curves, make with the principal are, are the values which must be assigned to the amplitude p, to determine the point where the tangent to the curve has the greatest inclination to the plane of xy, and the point which divides the quadrant into two parts, such that their difference shall be a maximum. This is plain; for the semniaxes of one ellipse are k tang k tanj; while the serniaxes of the other are-k sins and k sinj. And these angles are given by the equations tan2k-=tanc ; and tan2X=z sing On the Maximum Protangent in the Logarithmic Ellipse. LXXV.

Put the differential coefficient -,=O. This gives, as before, tanl= Substituting this expression in (a.), we get (1+)). (392.) We shall find the importance of this expression in the next section. From (392.) we derive tan2os= mn (1 +j)2r-mn Now (1+j)2=2+2j-i2=2+2j-.m-n+mn. Hence as s(1 M)( I )(I1 +j)2_ mnIs/ _M-,-n]2 Whence we get tans-= Multiply this equation, numerator and deV/1-m+ 4/1-n nominator, by V,/I -m-/1 -n, and the last expression will become tan'r= mn A/1M mn -n n-m n-rn In (171.) we found for the serinxes of the cylinder, whose intersection with tile * * . . a s/~~mn Al/1-m b /mn I-71 paraboloid is the logarithmic ellipse, a-m 6 V= -_ Hence tanr= k-) . .(393.) This gives a simple expression for the tangent of the maximum parabolic are, analogous to (385.) and (391.). We have only to take in the parabola, whose semiparameter is k, an arc whose ordinate is a-b, to determine the maximum protangent parabolic arc. The value tanp= /, which fixes the position and magnitude of the maximnum. protangent arc to the logarithmic ellipse, renders tan2X=b. For (150.) gives tan p= -+--tan 2. But (152.) gives C-B and Cl tanl~x hence tangs 1-m. If we now make tan2@P= 1 tanX= V1_n a as we may infer from (171.). Now substituting this value of tan'X in (155.), we shall get a-b tanr=Again, if we differentiate the values of x, y, z given in (158.), the coordinates of the extremity of the arc measured fr om the minor axis, and substitute thema in the general 406 DR. BOOTH ON THE GEOMETRICAL PROPERTIES OF ELLIPTIC INTEGRALS.. expression for the tangent of the inclination of any curve to the plane of xy, namely, dz 'VLd 9' and make S=X, we shall get, as before, putting for tan2X=tan2S, the value a dz a-b 1Vd~ 2-+dy2= k . Hence the arcs have a common extremity, since they have the same inclination to the plane of xy. As "=tan2X is the value of tan2X, which gives the maximum protangent =a-b in the plane ellipse, the base of the cylinder; it follows that the point of maximum division on the logarithmic ellipse is orthogonally projected into the point of maximum division on the plane ellipse; and the corresponding protangent in the latter a-b is the ordinate of the parabolic arc, which expresses the difference between the corresponding arcs of the former. Thus, while the arcs which together constitute the quadrant on the plane ellipse, differ by the difference of the semiaxes a-b, the corresponding arcs of the logarithmic ellipse will differ by an arc of a parabola whose ordinate is a-b. LXXVI. When the amplitude p is given by the equation tanp= . or when the protangent is a maximum, the corresponding arc of the spherical ellipse, or of the logarithmic ellipse, may be expressed by functions of the first and second orders only. This may be shown as follows. When tanp=> the arcs a and a, of the spherical ellipse, or the arcs z and S of the logarithmic ellipse, together make up the quadrant C. Hence o'+cr,=C, or :+S=C. But we have also a' 6a=7, as in (52.), and S='r, as in (160.). Therefore C-T C+r C+T' C-T =2 2t= 2 2 Or a' and a',, or I and S may be expressed as simple functions of C and a. Now C, the quadrant, as we have shown in the last section, may be expressed by functions of the first and second orders onlv, while r is an arc either of a circle or of a parabola. Hence an elliptic integral of the third order, whose amplitude p= tan-'( may be expressed by functions of the first and second orders only. SECTION X.-On Derivative H yperconic Sections. LXXVII. We shall now proceed to show that, when a hyperconic section is given, whether it be spherical or paraboloidal, we may frorn it derive a series of curves, whose moduli and parameters shall decrease or increase according to a certain law; so that ultimately the rectification of these curves may be reduced to the calculation of circular or parabolic arcs, or in other words, to circular functions or logarithms. We shall also show that all these derived curves, together with the original curve, may be traced on the same generating surface, i. e. on the same sphere or paran boloid. DR. BOOTH ON THE GEOMETRICAL PROPERTIES OF ELLIPTIC INTEGRALS. 407 In (186.) we have shown that the rectification of a plane ellipse whose semiaxes are a and b, may be reduced to the rectification of another plane ellipse whose semiaxes a, b, are given by the equations a,=a+b, b,=2Vab, of which the eccentricity is less than that of the former. a+b is that portion of the tangent, drawn through the point of maximum division, which lies between the axes; and N/ab is the perpendicular from the centre on it.

Indeed it is necessary that this should be the case, because -the parameters of the derived functions, increasing or diminishing as they do, must at length pass from between the limits 1 and i2. Should they do so, the integral would be no longer of the circular form, but of the logarithmic. Now we cannot pass from one of these forms to the other by any but an imaginary transformation. This objection does not hold when the parameter is positive, because the limits of the positive parameter are 0 and xo.

Or, referring to the geometrical representatives of these expressions, we found for the focal distance it of this derived curve, the expression n,= tan 2,=(l+I)n; but if we turn to (389.) we shall see that this is the expression for the maximum protangent to the original spherical ellipse, which is given by the equation tan (1+2. We thus arrive at this curious relation between the curves successively derived, that the maximum protangent of any one of the spherical ellipses becomes the focal distance of the one immediately succeeding in the series.

Whenever therefore this relation exists between the parameters and modulus of the original integral, the first derived integral will represent the circular logarithmic ellipse, which may be integrated by functions of the first and second orders. Accordingly whenever the above relation exists between the parameters, the integral of the third order may be redluced to others of the first and second orders. If in the second, third, or any other of the (leIived logarithmnic ellipses, we can make the parameters equal, this derived ellipse will be of the circular form, and its lrectification tmay be effected by integrals of the first and second orders only; accordingly the rectification of all the ellipses which precede it in the scale, may be effected by integrals of the first and second orders only. We may repeat the remiark made in LXXIX. T-he (eirived ftunctions of two integrals of the logarithmic form with reciprocal parameters, have themselves reciprocal parameters. LXXXII.

LXXXIII. There are several plane curves, whose lengths we may express by elliptic integrals of the third order. For example, the length of the elliptic lemniscate, or the locus of the intersections of central perpendiculars on tangents to an ellipse, is equal to that of a spherical ellipse, which is supplemental to itself, or the sum of whose principal arcs is equal to z. We cannot represent elliptic integrals of the third order generally, by the arcs of curves, whose equations in their simplest forms contain only two constants. Thus let a and b be the constants. We shall have two equations between the constants the parameter and the modulus of the function, i=f(a, b), n=f'(a, b). Assume a as invariable, and eliminate b, we shall have one resulting equation between i, n, and a, or F(a, i, n) =0; or n depends on i. When there are three independent constants, as in the preceding investigations, a, b, and k, we shall have i=f(a, b, k), n=f'(a, b, k). Eliminating successively b and k, we shall have two resulting equations, instead of one, F(a, k, i, n)=0, and F'(a, b, i, n) =0, or i and n depend on two equations, and may therefore be independent.
