(80) VII. A Letter from Mr. Atkinson, Surgeon in White-Chappel: Concerning an Imposthumation in the Stomach. To the same. S I R, T H E Case you desire a particular account of, was as follows. I had a Patient about seven Years ago, which had a large Tumour on the upper part of her Belly, it was hard and painful, but did not alter the natural colour of the Skin, and had been three Months in coming. I applied a warm Gum Plaister to it, which in about a Fortnights time brought it to a Suppuration. I then applied a Caustick about the bigness of a Shilling; when the Eschar fell off, I saw a solid kind of Substance appear in the Orifice, I laid hold of it with my Forceps, and pulled it gently towards me~ upon which there thrust forcibly out a quantity of it, that near fill'd my Hand, so I drest it. Next dressing, the same Substance appear'd again, which on her straining, forced out near twice as much as before. I was at a great loss to determine what this stuff was, but at last concluded it was the Omentum it self, in which Opinion I was confirm'd by some other Surgeons I shew'd it to. I was still in doubt, whether the Stomach was concerned in this Case or not, till the next Removal of the Dressings, at which there spurted out above half a Pint of Ale in a full Stream, which was part of a Pint she had drunk a little while before. I now concluded the Case mortal, however, I ordered her to keep her Bed, to lie constantly upon her Back, and feed on things of easie Digestion. (81) Digestion. The greatest part of what she eat or drank, came through the Ulcer for eight or ten Days, so that I had no hopes of ever curing it, yet contrary to my Expectation in about six Weeks she was perfectly cured, and is now living and in good Health.
