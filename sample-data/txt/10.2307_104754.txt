XLVII. Part of a Letter from William Folkes, Esq; F. R. S. to his Brother the President, concerning a Shock of an Earthquake felt at Newton in Northamptonshire, on Sunday, September 30. 1750. Dear Brother, O N Sunday last, rather before One, whilst we were at Church, we had an Earthquake here. The Noise, to the best of my Judgment, continued near a Minute; but was not so loud as either of those I heard at London. Several of the Congregation perceived the Ground tremble; but I cannot say I did. It is said to have been more violent in several Places in the Neighbourhood than here; but this I much question. Also the Day Iwent Read Oct. 25. 1750. [702] I went thro' Stamford to Grantham, in my Way to Yorkshire, an Earthquake was felt in both those Places: So that I have been within the Knowledge of no less than Four of these Shocks of Nature in Eight Months time; but, thank God, none of them attended with any ill Consequences, any farther than furnishing Room for melancholy Reflections upon such a disagreeable Alteration in our Climate, which had been generally thought before tolerably free from this Calamity. Believe me to be, with most sincere Love and Esteem, Dear Brother, Your most faithful, and obedient humble Servant, W. Folkes. XLVIII.
