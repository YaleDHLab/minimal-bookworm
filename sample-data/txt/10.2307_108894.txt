[ 545 ] X. On the Sextactic Points of a Plane Curve. By A. CAYLEY, F.R.S. Received November 5,-Read December 22, 1864. IT is, in my memoir " On the Conic of Five-pointic Contact at any point of a Plane Curve" , remarked that as in a plane curve there are certain singular points, viz. the points of inflexion, where three consecutive points lie in a line, so there are singular points where six consecutive points of the curve lie in a conic; and such a singular point is there termed a "1sextactic point.' The memoir in question (here cited as "former memoir") contains the theory of the sextactic points of a cubic curve; but it is only recently that I have succeeded in establishing the theory for a curve of the order m. The result arrived at is that the number of sextactic points is zs2m(12n27), the points in question being the intersections of the curve mn with a curve of the order 12in-27, the equation of which is (12nT2-54m+57)H Jac.

We have similarly 'a Q ayQ ayv and a?n+=Aiff+'bj; and in like manner Jac. (U, H, 12) Jac. (U, H, f2f)+Jac. (U, H, Qy) which explains the signification of the notations Jac. (U, H, Q Jac. (U, H, Qua). The condition for a sextactic point is in the first instance obtained in a form involving the arbitrary coefficients (x, p, v); viz. we have an equation of the order 5 in (x, Ad, v) and of the order 12m-22 in the coordinates (x, y, z). But writing a=-x+P~y+Yz, by successive transformations we throw out the factors a2, a, a, a, thus arriving at a result independent of (X, A, v); viz. this is the before-mnentioned equation of the order 12m-27. The difficulty of the investigation consists in obtaining the transformations by means of which the equation in its original form is thus divested of these irrelevant factors. ,Article Nos. 1 to 6.-Investigation of the Condition for a Sextactic Point. 1. Following the course of investigation in my former memoir, I take (X, Y, Z) as current coordinates, and I write T=(*2X,. Y, Z)w==O for the equation of the given curve; (x, y, z) are the coordinates of a particular point on the given curve, viz. the sextactic point; and U, =(*)x, y, z)m, is what T becomes when (x, y, z) are written in place of (X, Y, Z): we have thus U= 0 as a condition satisfied by the coordinates of the point in question. 2. Writing for shortness DU =(X@ +YbY+ZbZ) U, D2U (X-a+Ya?+Za)2U, and taking H--aX+bY+cZ=O for the equation of an arbitrary line, the equation D2U-IIDU=O is that of a conic having an ordinary (two-pointic) contact with the curve at the point (x, y, z); and the coefficients of TI are in the former memoir determined so that the contact may be a five-pointic one; the value obtained for rI is IlI 2IDH+ADU, where A = (-3 ll+4P). 3. This result was obtained by considering the coordinates of a point of the curve as functions of a single arbitrary parameter, and taking X+dx +Id2, %+d, +r d4x, y+4 &c.: z? &c.

Writing, as in my former memoir, A, B, C for the first differential coefficients of U, we have By-C(, CX-Av, A(-B 1 for the values of dx, dy, dz, and instead of the symbol D used in my former memoir, I use indifferently the original symbol s, or write instead thereof a, to denote the resulting value 3,( 3) = (ByCf)S+ (C Av}y+ (Ac443z and I remark here that for any function whatever 2, we have 2 A, B, C -Jac. (U a, 2), x, a, v where a=zx+py+vz. I write, as in the former memoir, (D(5 3 ( C, 0X, 1?12X j pj~ )2; and also which new symbol V serves to express the functions II, 5l, occurring in the former memoir; viz. we have fI-2Vq), [S =2VH, so that the symbols III, C are not any longer required. 8. I remark that the symbols a, V are each of them a linear function of (as, ',, 'X), with coefficients which are functions of the variables (x, y, z); and this being so, that for any function II whatever, we have NVIJ)= (a . V)H +3VII, viz. in '(VFJ) we operate with V on H, thereby obtaining VII, and then with a on VII; in (D . V)II we operate with a upon V in so far as V is a function of (x, y, z), thus obtaining a new operating symbol a . V, a linear function of (bx, -,, a=), and then operate with b . V upon Hl; and lastly, in aVd, we simply multiply together a and V, thus obtaining a new operating symbol aV of the form (be -, , and then operate therewith on IH; it is clear that, as regards the last-mentioned mode of combination, the symbols a and V are convertible, or aV=V6, that is, bV1I=Va1H. It is to be observed throughout the memoir that the point ( . ) is used (as above in b. V) when an operation is performed upon a symbol of operation as operand; the mere apposition of two or more symbols of operation (as above in bV) denotes that the symbols of operation are simply multiplied together; and when aV is followed by a letter H denoting not a symbol of operation, but a mere function of the coordinates, that is in an expression such as bVHI, the resulting operation ZV is performed upon HI as operand; if instead of the single letter H1 we have a compound symbol such as HU or HVa, so that the expression is 3EHU, aHVa, 6VHU or bVHVS, then it is to be understood that it is merely the immediately following function H which is operated upon by b or bV; in the few instances where any ambiguity might arise a special explanation is given. 550 PROFESSOR CAYLEY ON TE SEXTACTIC POINTS OF A PLANE CURVE.

For the sake of exhibiting in their proper connexion some of the formul3 employed in the foregoing first transformation of the condition for a sextactic point, I have investigated them in the present Appendix, which however is numbered continuously with the memoir. 54.

Before going further, I remark that we have identically (a XX y :)2( cry he it 7 pZj)2 aX+hy+gz, hx+by+fz, gX+fy+cz 2 OC , (i , V (S **XPac P r5p e (if for shortness p acx+I3y+yz, Xx + py+vz) p2(q Ajd V )2 2jpS(R,. .)jI, i, Bloc, /3, y) * Ad, /3, r)2. 58. If in this equation we take (a, b, cf, g, h) to be the second differential coefficients of U, and write also (a, 3, y) =(b, y, b), the equation becomes m(tI)u U1(m-_ )262= 4, (X-6 +y-aV+Z-a)2 which is a general equation for the transformation of b2(=b2). 59. If with the two sides of this equation we operate on U, we obtain n(qn-l)UrU-(qn l)1''U= M(qn-l)()U -2(n-1)wVU +W D U; and substituting the values FU=24)5, VUm_ 1 H. OU=3HM, we find the before-mentioned expression of 62U. 60. Operating with the two sides of the same equation on a function H of the order n', we find M(Mn-)UVH___( 1o)23b2H= ar(m`'-1-])(DH ~2 (ml I)WH + a2 ]H; and in particular if H is the Hessian, then writing ml'= 3m6, and putting UO0, we find the before-mentioned expression for '2H. 61. But we may also from the general identical equation deduce the expression for (BH)2. In fact taking H a function of the degree m' and writing (o, ,y) ETH5n2 as) 572 PROFESSOR CAYLEY ON THE SEXTACTIC POINTS OF A PLANE CURVE. we have m~nz-1)(, .

Proof of equation 32= m_ 1 (XS(/b+Yy+i+z)+ 1 7V. We have (>;(ca.-B3Z) ?p(AD,Ca) + v(B~.-,Aby)), which is = x(Cby B'6z) +p(Abz C'a)?(B'b-"A'r), where A%= bA=a(BY-Cp%)+h(C?

Substituting the values (m-1)(A, B, C) =(ax+h4+gz, hx+by+fz, gx +fy+ cZ), we have and similarly (in1)B' =A(~z@x) +t.L?Lz-4Tx) + v(@z -2 (in-.1)C' -=X(kxZy) +f(3x-y kY+ '(;faky), and then (in1)(C'By B'36) = [(Sxy)BY(az -0)3] = ~(2) 1?CCX5Z '6y5 'a-) 2(Xa,, +YBy+zb)1 +Z[$(, 3, 11 3a5y B., (xx+ b~z) +v [x(05 ,1, 3CO, -ay a, e(Xax+yay+za=) = (R[, ...3tA, pi, yj'a, 'ay, ejx5Z p?, Y3A 4 )(X-aX+Y'6Y +z'6.); that is (in?-1)(C'ay Bla) =xV-(Z, ~, etX, ,u,, >)(qa~yay+:a=) and so 1qs )(Ala,'av) =yV -(1?r 13&vf3 pa Y)(XBX+YBy + ZBZ)) (m 1) (Bla-b / Y6 Z(0, 3F 3Cl, P, v)(X'6 yy~a) whence (in1)2( +pi + vz)V ( .. . :X, Pi, V)'(XaX+YY+zb) or finally PROFESSOR CAYLEY ON THE SEXTACTIC POINTS OF A PLANE CURVE. 573 63. This leads to the expression for 32U; we have -a2 =( 1)2 (X-. +ya+zb )2 2 (2-~ 1) V(X-a +Y-a+z-a) + (m )2 and operating herewith on U, we find 32(n1) 2U 2((m -1) )2 (D:VU + (m-.)2 V2U; or since VU-m_ H. V2U=HC, this is a~U (m1)2I2+jlm~)2HPI. 64. W;Ve have 3,a2U=O, and thence a2ab+ a+a2)u-o, that is la3U= 1)2U-2U; or substituting the values of 32U and 36U, we find the value of b D6U as given in the Table. And then from the equation (-a4 +6a 2+T94 3+ 3-a+4)U, or a4U= 4(+ 6aa 2 + 4aa13 + 3a2)U, we find the value of '4U, and the proof of the expressions in the Table is thus completed. 65.

(A(p3,vay) -+ B(v3?~z) + C(kay-fi~)) -VA(az-vay) + VB(v>a-?a) + VC(xay-?); and then VA=(2[. ...>7, pjv Plar h, g )-=H VB = (Y* Cghj b I f) Hth VC=(a, .= 3, k, , c)=Hv; or substituting these values, we have the equation in question. 574 PROFESSOR CAYLEY ON THE SEXTACTIC POINTS OF A PLANE CURVE. 66. Proof of expression for 3b. We have a2m _D1 (d+y +z __ and thence operating on the two sides respectively with s, we have +m-1i{3V+Wa .V}; or since this is a3_1 a(a ay3) m_1 a m__1a 67. Proof of expression for b3H. Operating with b upon H, we have at once _M_ 1 -3H _i 3 _r11 +D m_ i (-b.V)H. The remainder of the present Appendix is preliminary, or relating to the investigation of the expressions for b6,2U and 'b23bU, used ante, No. 31. 68. Proof of equation V2bU=VIH -lMH '.

We have -2 (rnij@ )<2a+ya.y+[-z:)2 (rnM2-)2(-a+gay 2z)2 X72 576 PROFESSOR CAYLEY ON THE SEXTACTIC POINTS OF A PLANE CURVE. and thence multiplying by a, =6, and with the result operating upon U, we find 12U _ () ( 2(m-2) ___( I_____ _ l__ av_ But aU=O, and thence also V( U)-O, thatis (V . b)U+ V6UO; moreover V .6=O, and therefore (V.6 )U-O, whence also VbU=O. Therefore ~2 al2= (M1)2av or substituting for 6V2U its value =IDDH-Hll), we have the required expression for al2u 70. Proof of equation u 2 ( (3m-6)H-a4)+(-m+ 3)@3H) + (m V)H(. We have 63= M-1 -a_(_.+y-.+z-6)-_-a + m_ I-a. v, and thence multiplying by 'a2=-2, and operating on U, 'a2 b3=aml3<)-62U_ mDYU + m~ .V)-a 2U. To reduce (a .

V)a2U+2VT2U, and since m_ ( multiplying by V6, and with the result operating on U, we obtain rn-2 vaD~u m_ 4 V-a U+.m 172U; or since VanUo, this is Vaa'62U= v2BU. Hence n-i (Vb2U)=V-a3U+(-V. V)62U+ 21V2aU, that is (-a.V)-a2U=-a(V-a2U)_V-a3UV2Bu. Substituting this value of (b. V)62U, we find rn-2 rn-i2U)_VPa3U + m2 )2(-2V2aU), the three lines whereof are to be separately further reduced.

For the second line, we have V(-62U)=V-U2U+2(V .a)u = Va2U, since V . a=o, and therefore (V .B)b U 0 that is 'V'2U=1V(62U)=9mu t-H =m_ V (UV+(VU)M1)(WVH +2aHVa); or writing U=o VUm_ Hi Va ?, this is VY2U (m-2)5H(D .2jVH =(TM -i)2 (Mn1)2VI whence also b~v3u)=(,,,_1)2s (H(M<fH 1~)2(V) Similarly V'63U= V('b3U) V m _l1> (m-1)2aH =m vua +uv(b(D) _ a;(2V(aH) +22SVaaH or putting U=O, VU= H Va=F,5 and observing also that V(6H), =V6H+(V . b)H is equal to VBH, that is to BVH, we obtain Va3U= (-m m(H -2aIH)-)VH; and then from the above value of b(V32U), we find (31)2( -2HM'4+mP4>H)+ (Mi 1)2( b(VH)+ V) or observing that the term multiplied by (i1)2 is = -(.
