An Account of the same, by the Rev. Mr. Tho. Birch F. R. S. T H I S Morning, Thursday March 8. 1749-50. about 18 Minutes before 6, according to equal Time, or half an Hour after 5 by the Sun, I felt, in my Bed-chamber, on the second Story of my House in Norfolk Street, adjoining to the River, a Shock of an Earthquake, much stronger, and of longer Duration, than that which I had felt on Thursday Feb. 8. I was full awake, and had just begun to dress myself, when I was alarm'd with the trembling of the Room, attended with Read March 8. 1749-50. [616] with a Noise somewhat different from that of the former Shock this Day Month, which seem'd to be occasion'd by some great Weight falling upon the Floor above me; whereas the Noise of this latter appear'd to me caus'd only by the tremulous Motion of the whole Room and the adjoining ones, the Walls, Wainscot, Furniture, &c. When I came down to my Study on the first Floor, I found a Book thrown down from an upper Shelf. My Family were awaken'd by the Shock. The Air was at that time, and for some Hours after, extremely calm, and the Wind westerly. This Account was drawn up immediately before I had seen any other Person, except my own Family. I have been since told by a Gentleman, who resided many Years in the West Indies, that this last Shock was more violent than any he had felt there, except one at Carthagena, in which a City, about 200 Leagues distant from thence, was swallow'd up at that Instant. Another Gentleman describ'd to me the Sensation, upon being awaken'd by the Motion, to be like that of falling into a Fit. Tho. Birch. XI.
