[ 217, XII. On the K-partitions qf the R-gon and R-ace. By the Rev. THOMAS P. KIRKMAN, A.M., RF..S., Rector of Croft with Southworth. Communicated by ARTHUR CAYLEY, Esq., F.R.S. Received November 13,-Read December 11, 1856. 1. By the kpartitions of an r-gon, I mean the number of ways in which it can be divided by k-1 diagonals, of which none crosses another; two ways being different only when no cyclical permutation or reversion of the numbers 1 2 3.. r at the angles can make them alike: and by the k-_partitions of an r-ace (a pencil of r rays in space or a plane), I mean the number of ways in which it can be divided into k smaller pencils, by the introduction of k-I connecting lines, of which none enclose a space; two ways being different only when by no cyclical permutation or reversion of the numbers 1 2 3.. r in the angular spaces of the r-ace they can be made identical. The polygon here considered is the section of a pyramid, and its discussion includes that of the polyace. The enumeration of the partitions of the polygon and polyace is indispensable in the theory of the polyedra. In a memoir "1 On the x-edra which have an (x1)-gonal base, and all their Summits Triedral," in the Transactions of the Royal Society, 1856, page 399, I have investigated the (r)-partitions of the r-ace, or the r-gon; for the number of x-edra there determined is exactly that of these (r-2)-partitions. What follows may be considered as a completion of the investigation in that memoir begun; yet not properly a continuation, inasmuch as the results there obtained are here deduced by a different and more general method. II. A partition of an r-gon is reversible or irreversible: reversible, when it is symmetrical about a diameter or bisector of the figure, so that the configuration is unaltered by a semirevolution about that line, which is called an axis of reversion, of which axes there may be one or many; and irreversible, when it is reversible about no axis. An irreversible is about no axis its own reflexion. An axis of reversion is always a bisector of the r-gon, and is agonal, monogonal, or diagonal, according as it passes through no angle, one angle only, or two angles of the r-gon; and the polygon is said to be about that axis agonally, monallnall ,, or diagonally reversible. A diagonal axis may be drawn or undrawn; a monogonal or agonal axis is always undrawn. III. A partition is said to be m-ly reversible when it has m axes of reversion. The simple 2n-gon (k 1) is 2n-ly reversible, having n agonal and n diagonal axes; and its sides may be so loaded with polygons, that this number of axes shall be either retained or diminished. The simple: (2n+1)-gon has 2n+1 monogonal axes, on which an r-gon MDcccLYJI. 2 G 218 REV. T. P. KIRKMAN ON TUE K-PARTITIONS OF THE R-GON AND R-ACE. may be built to have the same or a smaller number. To help our conceptions, we may always suppose our r-gon regularly inscribed in a circle; but it is evident that the syntypy of two identically-partitioned r-gons in no wise depends on such symmetry, but may remain after any distortion of either r-gon which does not change the angles on any diagonal. So that, if we wish to build an r'-gon on an inscribed r-gon, we need not fear exceeding the limits of the circle by our additions, while we may suppose these all contained within it. A partition is said to be m-ly irreversible, when it has an irreversible sequence of configuration m times repeated in the circuit of the r-gon. This sequence will occupy m angles; and, from whatever angle we begin to read, we shall see a sequence of sides m irreversible, such that through the mid-point of it no axis of reversion can be drawn. Obs. 1. Hence a 2m-ly irreversible has an irreversible sequence, simple if m=1, and rn-ple if m> 1, occupying half the circuit of the r-gon; but a (2m+ l)-ly irreversible has no repeated sequence occupying half its circuit. IV. THEOREM A. Every reversible (1+k)-partition of an r-gon has two reversible sequences of configuration which are bisected by alternate and equidistant axes of reversion, and has not more than two, whatever be the number of these axes. For, first, let there be only one axis of reversion in the r-gon: there must be two aspects of configuration observable from opposite ends of that axis, otherwise the figure would be reversible about a perpendicular to that axis, i. e. there would be two axes, contrary to hypothesis. Secondly, let there be more axes of reversion than one; any axis. a bisects an aspect A, because the figure is unchanged by a semirevolution about that axis; and the axis b next in order to a along the circumference bisects an aspect B. This B is different from A; for if not, the series of configurations read from a to b will be that read from b to a, and there will be either a vertex or a side centrally placed between a and b, having on both sides the same aspect, or an axis of reversion can be drawn between a and b; but b is the next in order to a, which is absurd; therefore B is not A. Now b bisecting the aspect B must have the axial termination a at the same distance on either side of it, and for the same reasons a must have the axial termination b at the same distance on either side of it; so that the terminations of the axes must recur at equal distances in the order ..a b a b a... bisecting the aspects . . A B A B.. And this series of aspects has as many terms as there are axial terminations, viz. 4m terms, if the number of axes is even, and 4m+2 if it be odd. Wherefore no aspect different from A and B can be bisected by any axis, and A and B, different reversible aspects or sequences, are bisected by alternate equidistant axes. Q. E. D. We may call A and B the two axial configurations. V. Obs. 2. A reversible partition of the r-gon having more than one axis of reversion,. has both reversible and irreversible sequences repeated in the circuit of the r-gon, which occupy an interval equal to that between alternate axes; those being reversible sequenpes REV. T. P. KIRKMAN ON THE K-PARTITIONS OF THE R-GON AND R-ACE. 219 which begin and end with a side or angle carrying an axial termination, and those being irreversible which begin and end at any other side or angle. Obs. 3. But a singly reversible partition has no sequence repeated in the circuit of the r-gon; for if it had a repeated sequence reversible as read from no point, the r-gon would not be reversible; and if it had a reversible sequence repeated in the circuit of the r-gon, it would not be singly reversible. Obs. 4. A 2m-ly reversible r-gon, if r> 2m, has beginning at any angle of the r-gon which is not the termination of an axis, an irreversible sequence, simple, if m=1, and m-ple, if M> 1, occupying half the circuit of the r-gon, and repeated in the other half. VI. THEOREM B. When the number of axes of reversion is odd in any partitioned r-gon, none is perpendicular to another; and when that number is even, every one is perpendicular to some other. For when the number is odd, there is on each side of any one a an equal number of terminations of other axes, all equidistant from a and from each other. And when that number is even, there is an odd number there of such terminations. Whence the truth of the proposition is evident. VII. THEOREM C. When the axes of reversion are odd in anypartitioned r-gon, each one bisects both axial configurations; and when they are even in number, each bisects but one, read on it alike at either end, and half the axes carry one, and half the other, axial configuration. This is very evident from what is proved in Theorem A, that the axial configurations present themselves alternately upon the axes in order. Cor. 1. If there be both agonal and diagonal axes, there is an equal number of each kind; and, as this number is even or odd, so is each axis perpendicular to one of its own or of the other kind. Obs. 5. A (2m+1)-ly reversible partition never has an irreversible sequence occupying half the circuit of the r-gon and repeated in the other half; for this would require that every axis of reversion should carry the same configuration at both ends, which are points in those two sequences. VIII. THEOREM D. If a diagonal be perpendicular to an axis of reversion in any h-ly reversible r-gon, it is one of a system of not fewer than h diagonals symmetrically placed about the centre. And all diagonals not perpendicular to that axis form pairs making each an angle bisected by that axis, or that produced. For if h be odd, every axis carries the same perpendicular; and if h beeven, at least jh axes carry that perpendicular on opposite sides of the centre; and these axes are equidistant from each other: whence the first part of the theorem is evident. The second part follows from the definition of an axis of reversion. Cor. The intersection of two produced diagonals equidistant from the centre, in any reversibly partitioned r-gon, is upon an axis of reversion. IX. THEOREM E. No (2m+1)-gon has an agonal or diagonal, and no (2m)-gon has a monogonal, axis of reversion. 2 G2 220 REV. T. P. KIRAN ON THE K-PARTITIONS OF THE R-GON AND R-ACE. For a monogonal axis must have an equal number of vertices of the r-gon on each side of it, besides the vertex through which it passes; hence r is odd. And a diagonal axis must have an equal number of vertices on either side, besides the two through which it passes. And an agonal axis, which passes through no angles, must have an equal number of vertices on either side. Hence, in these two latter cases, r is even. X. THEOREM F. ]f one axis of reversion is monogonal in a partitioned r-gon, all its axes qf reversion are monogonal and odd in number. For r is odd, and the r-gon cannot have either a diagonal or an agonal axis; and as each axis bisects two aspects, A and B, A must be opposite to B in the circle ..ABABAB.. of axial configurations; i. e. the number of its terms is 2(2h+1), wherefore the axes are odd in number. XI. THEOREM G. If there be a drawn axis of reversion, a, in a (1 +k)}partitioned r-gon, there cannot be more than one other axis. If there be another, b, it is undrawn, and perpendicular to the former, a, and is either agonal or diagonal, as r=4m+2, or r=4m. For, if there be a second axis, b, it cannot meet the drawn one, and must be undrawn. And all the k diagonals are symmetrically placed about or upon this b; therefore a, meeting it and bisecting it in the centre of the r-gon, meets it at right angles; otherwise (Theorem D) two diagonals would meet b in the centre, which is impossible. And no line besides b can so meet a; wherefore a and b are the only axes. As a is not a monogonal axis, neither is b (Theorem F). If r= 4m, a has on either side an even number of sides of the r-gon, and b, bisecting that system, is diagonal; if r= 4m+2, a has on either side an odd number of sides of the r-gon bisected by b, which is therefore an agonal axis. Q. E. D. XII. THEOREM H. If there be more than one undrawn axis of reversion in a partitioned r-gon, the r-gon is built regularly on a polygonal nucleus (Q), which is reversible about all the axes of reversion of the r-gon, and has no drawn diagonal. For consider the symmetry of the r-gon about any one of its axes, a, which are all undrawn (Theorem G). We see, on each side of a, f marginal faces, limited each by one diagonal d and certain sides of the r-gon, the 2f diagonals d forming pairs making angles bisected by a. Let these 2f faces be erased: the 2f lines d are now sides of an r'-gon (r' <r), which is still reversible about a, for the symmetry about a is not disturbed by the erasures. This r-gon has also 2f' marginal faces which can be erased, leaving an r"-gon (r" <r') still reversible about a; and thus by erasure of all the pairs of faces about a, the r-gon will be finally reduced to a polygon P, having no diagonals but what are bisected at right angles by a (Theorem ID). Let Q be that portion of P which contains the centre of the r-gon, and Q1, Q2, &c. the remaining portions of P limited by perpendiculars to a. Then Q has evidently no diagonals. Next consider the symmetry of the r-gon about any other axis b. We can reduce it by erasure of pairs of faces about b to a polygon P', consisting of a portion Q' about the centre and having no diagonals, and of portions limited by diagonals perpendicular to b. Q and Q' are polygons about the centre having no diagonals; they are therefore one REV. T. P. KIRKMAN ON THE K-PARTITIONS OF THE R-GON AND R-ACE. 221 polygon Q. The polygons Q1, Q, the remaining portions of P, have disappeared in the erasure of pairs of faces about b and Q; that is, every one of them, Qm, is one of a set of two or more faces standing symmetrically about Q. Therefore Q is a nucleus, reversible about all the axes of the r-gon, free from diagonals, and having everything arranged symmetrically about it in the r-gon. Q. E. D. XIII. THEOREM K. If there be no axis of reversion in a partitioned r-gon except one -undrawn, a, the figure is built symmetrically about a and about a polygonal nucleus P, which has either no diagonals, or only what are at right angles to a. This is established by the former part of the preceding demonstration. But the polygon P, in this singly reversible r-gon, if it has diagonals perpendicular to the axis, is not properly a nucleus; nor is there any reason why one portion of it, Q, should be called a nucleus rather than Q, or Q2; for P can be constructed by loading opposite sides of any of them with proper polygons. But if P is a simple polygon, it is properly the nucleus of the figure, which is made by loading opposite sides of it, on different sides of the axis, with the same polygons, thus preserving the reversibility about the axis. XIV. THEOREM L. If a diagonal axis of the nucleus is an axis of reversion of the r-gon, it is a diagonal axis thereof. For it passes through two angles of the r-gon. THEOREM M. An agonal axis of the r-gon is an agonal axis of the nucleus. For a diagonal or monogonal axis of the nucleus passes through a vertex of the r-gon, and cannot be an agonal axis of it. THEOREM N. If an agonal axis of the nucleus is an axis of the r-gon, it mny be an agonal, or a diagonal, or a monogonal axis of it. For the sides of the nucleus through which that agonal axis passes may be sides of the r-gon, or they may be loaded with agonally reversible polygons having the same agonal axis: this will then be an agonal axis of the r-gon. Or those sides may be loaded both with monogonally reversible polygons, having their axes in prolongation of that agonal axis: this makes it a diagonal axis of the r-gon. Or one of those sides may be loaded with a monogonally reversible polygon, and the other either not at all, or with an agonally reversible: this, if the axes of the imposed polygon are in direction with that agonal axis, makes it a monogonal axis of the r-gon. XV. THEOREM O. A rnonoyonal axis of the nucleus nay be either a monogonal or a diagonal axis of the r-gon. For the side of the nucleus which that axis bisects may be unloaded, or loaded with an agonally reversible polygon, so as to make it a monogonal axis of the r-gon. Or that side can be loaded with a monogonally reversible polygon, so as to make the axis a diagonal one of the r-gon. It is easily seen, and unnecessary to be formally propounded, how and how far the converses of these latter propositions are to be laid down. 222 REV. T. P. KIRKMAN ON TiHE K-PARTITIONS OF THE R-GON AND R-ACE. bDef. A clear axis of reversion meets no diagonal at right angles. A scored or loaded axis of reversion meets one or more diagonals at right angles. An e-scored axis of reversion meets e diagonals at right angles, of course bisecting them. The clear and the loaded axis are both supposed undrawn. XVI. THEOREM P. If a clear axis of a (2m+3)-ly reversible r-gon be scored in any way by e diagonals at right angles to it, the r-gon becomes singly reversible about that scored axis. For, let ABC.. be the axes of reversion of the r-gon N. The scored axis A remains an axis of reversion, because the symmetry about is not disturbed by the perpendicular scores; but none of the other axes BC ... is perpendicular to A (Theorem B); wherefore each meets singly all the scores upon A, and is no axis of reversion (Theorem D) of the scored r-gon N'. Let then, M, any other diameter of N' not amongst ABC... be an axis of reversion; it meets all the diagonals to which it is not perpendicular in pairs whose angles it bisects (Theorem D); wherefore these are pairs of equidistants from the centre; now the intersections of all these, except the newly-added scores upon A, are on the axes BC... (Cor. Theorem D); wherefore M, passing through the centre and one of these intersections, is one of the lines ABCC..., contrary to hypothesis, which is absurd. Therefore A is the only axis of reversion of N'. Q. E. D. XVII. THEOREM Q. If any loaded axis (A) of a (2m+3)-ly reversible r-gon (N) be cleared by erasure of the diagonals perpendicular to A, the cleared figure (N') is sinqgly reversible about that axis A. For, let ABC... be the axes of reversion of N, on which are the diagonals at right angles to them abc... forming a system of lines symmetrically placed about the centre (Theorem D). No one of these B, after the erasure of a from A, is an axis of reversion of N', because the diagonal b at right angles to B is not one of a system of lines symmetrically placed about the centre (Theorem D). Let then, M, any other diameter of N' be an axis of reversion of N'; this line meets all the diagonals of N' not perpendicular to it in pairs, whose angles it bisects, wherefore these pairs are equidistants from the centre of N'; but all the intersections of these pairs lie on the lines ABC... (Cor. Theorem D); wherefore M is one of these lines ABC... Q. E. A. Therefore A is the only axis of reversion of N'. Q. E. D. XVIII. THEOREM R. If a clear axis (A) of reversion of a 2m-ly reversible partitioned r-gon (N) be scored by perpendiculars to it symmetrically about the centre, the figure is not made singly reversible about (A); but if it be so scored unsymmetrically about the centre, the scored figure (N') is singly reversible about that axis (A). For there is an axis perpendicular to A (Theorem B) about which the symmetry is not disturbed by symmetric scores, i. e. pairs of parallels to it equidistant from the centre, or a diameter parallel with such pairs. But when the scores are not such pairs, or a diameter and such pairs, the axis perpendicular to A is no axis of reversion evidently; nor is any other diameter of N', REV. T. P. KIRKMAN ON THE K-PARTITIONS OF THE R-GON AND R-ACE. 223 for it meets all those scores singly. Wherefore A is the only axis of reversion of N'. Q. E. D. XIX. THEOREM S. If a clear axis A of a singly reversible partitioned r-gon N' be scored by diagonals perpendicular to it, the scored figure N becomes sometimes singly, and at other times (2m+ 3)-ly reversible about the scored axis. For the r-gon N' being singly reversible has no axis of reversion perpendicular to A; and no addition of diagonals parallel to the perpendicular diameter can make it an axis of reversion; for that addition cannot alter its intersections with the diagonals of N'; wherefore N is not 2m-ly reversible (Theorem D and B). If N' should be the N' of Theorem Q, and the scores upon A should be those erased in that theorem, N will be the (2m+3)-ly reversible of that theorem: but if this is not the case in both these conditions, N will remain, like N' unscored, singly reversible about A, since the scores do not disturb the symmetry about that axis. Q. E. D. What precedes about singly reversibles with loaded axes is sufficient for our present purpose, which is to show that before we can determine the number of singly reversibles, with clear and loaded axes, it is necessary that we should know the number of (2m,+1)-ly reversible (1 +ke)-partitions of the r-gon which have a clear axis, i. e. which have clear axes; for here the configurations about all the axes are alike (Theorem C); and also that of the 2m-ly reversible (1+k -e)-partitioned r-gons which have one configuration about clear axes, and also of those which have both their configurations about clear axes. This matter will be more evident as we proceed. XX. Let R21tagdi(r, k)., RLag(r, k)n, R'ldi(r, k)n, Rhmo(r, k). denote the whole number of (1+k)-partitioned r-gons built on the n-gonal nucleus (n> 2), which have (Theorem C) p2h.agdi(r, k)n, ih agonal and h diagonal, Rh.ag (r, k)n, h agonal only, Rh.di (r, k)n, h diagonal only, and Rhino (r, k)n, h monogonal axes only, of reversion. We shall denote those having all their axes clear by c subscript to R; those having no clear axes by zero subscript to R; those of the second and third classes which have half their axes, bearing one configuration, clear, by -c subscript, and those of the first, which have half their axes clear, the agonal or the diagonal ones, by ac or dc subscript to R.

In the fourth class the number of axes of reversion is alwvaysv odd. And in all those equations we suppose nq43. 224 REV. T. P. KIRKMAN ON THE K-PARTITIONS OF TiE R-GON AND R-ACE. XXI. Before we can proceed to investigate formulae for the determination of these numbers, it is necessary,Problem a. Tojind the k-divisions qf the r-gon or r-ace. By the (1 +k)-divisions of an r-gon I mean the entire number of ways in which k diagonals can be drawn in it, none crossing another, all ways being different which occupy different angles 1 2.. r of the r-gon. Thus there are five 3-divisions, but only one 3-partition of the pentagon made by drawing a pair of diagonals. And there are five 3-divisions of a pentace made by breaking it into three triaces, but these are all the same 3-partition. If we call the number sought of (1 +k)-divisions of the r-gon D(r, k), we can express it in terms of D(r', k'), r'<r, and Pl <k. For consider any diagonal b, drawn from any angle 3 of the r-gon, dividing it into a (3+h)-gon and a (r-h1)-gon. This line b will be drawn in the (l+k)-divisions along with every (1+s)-division of the (3+h)-gon, combined with every (k-S)-division of the (rh 1)-gon, e diagonals being drawn on one side, and k-I diagonals on the other side of b. That is, :6D(3+h, s)XD(r-h---1, k-s-1) taken from s=O to s=k-1, is the number of (1+k)-divisions in which that line b will be seen. If, now, we give to h every value from h= 0 to h=r4; we shall have counted every (1 +k)-division in which any line b appears that can be drawn from that angle. If we put for P each of the r angles in succession, that is, if we multiply by r, we shall have enumerated every (1 +k)-division in which any line b appears, that is drawn from any angle P3. But we have thus handled twice, once from either extremity, every line in every set of k diagonals; that is, we have counted every (1+k)-division 2k times. Wherefore the correct result is 2k.D(r, k)= r.:>,2{D(3+h, s).D(r-h-l, k-s -l)}, where every value of h from hAO to h=r-4 is to be combined with every value of s from, s=0 to sk-.1. If, then, we know these divisions for all values of r and k up to D(r-i, k-1), we obtain D(r, k) by addition. And as D(r+O)=1, and D(r, 1) = r. (r3), D(r, 2) is given, and thence D(r, 3), and so on, up to D(r, k), for any given values of r and k. XXII. To find D(r, k) in terms of r, for the general value of r, and for a given value of k, we write D(r, k) =Ar2k+Br2kI+ .. +Lr+M; for we know that this number is not greater than {2(r. (r3))}kI-1 xk+11, that of all possible sets of k diagonals that cross or not. Then, from the 2k+1 equations, D( k+3, k)=A( k+3)2k+B( k+3)2k-l+ +M. D( k+4,k)=A( k+4)2k+B( k+4)2k+l+ ..+M D(3k+r3, k)= A(3k+ 3)2k+B(3k+ 3)2k+1+ .. 3REV. T. P. KIRKMAN ON THBE K-PARTITIONS OF THE R-GON AXI R-ACE. 225 the left members of which are to be calculated by the preceding article, we can determine the coefficients A, B, .. LM. So far as I have pursued the inquiry, I find always one factorial form of the function D(r, k); but in order to prove that this is always the form, it is necessary to show that, if D(3 + h, (3+h)'x (3+h2)e+, and D~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ki (rh-,k-2-)kl-X t D(r, ks) Y2-ki, f{D(3 +hs ).D(r-h 1, k--)= X Efrom h=O to h=r -4, and from a=0 to =k--1; which is the expression that I continually find. This summation I must leave to the learned and industrious reader; but, meanwhile I shall venture to enunciate with the best demonstration, such as it is, that occurs to me, the following THEOREM T. The number of (1 +k)-divisions of an r-gon, i. e. of all the ways in whichl k diagonals can be drawn in it, none crossing another, is D(r, k)= -(r-k--2)k-_ For first, let the r-gon be divided into triangles, i. e. let k=r--3. Here the (3+h)gon of the preceding article can have only h diagonals, or sh; and the final result, the last equation of that article, becomes D(r, r 3) =2(r-3) .Eh{D(3+h, A).D(r-h-,rA4} from h=O to h=r-4. Hence we obtain for r=4, r=5, r=6, &c., D(45 1)=4 D(39 0).D(3) 0)=2= 4431 2 F4-_1 .4D(51 2) =A. {D(31 0).

For any m-ly irreversible k-partition has a different configuration about r: m successive angles (III.), and is nowhere its own reflexion; so that r: m more configurations the reflexions of the former are read on the reversed face of the r-gon. And as all these configurations are found among the k-divisions sepqarately enumerated about the same angle, this partition is counted 2r: mn times among them. And any m-ly reversible k-partition of the r-gon has r: m different configurations in the interval between the termination of any axis A and its repetition, that is, about r: m angles if A be an agonal axis, and about r: m sides if it be diagonal. The central configuration of these r: m is about the axis alternate with A; the others form pairs of configurations reflecting each other. All these are constructed and counted separately among the k-divisions about the same point of the r-gon; i. e. this partition is counted r: m times among the k-divisions. Q. E. I). Let Rm(r, k) denote the entire number of mn-ly reversible (1 +k)-partitions of the r-gon about all nuclei, and all kinds of axes, and let F"(r, k) stand for the complete number of m-ly irreversible (1+k)-partitions.

XXIV. Our first step towards the actual solution of our problem of partitions, which, after all these tedious prolegomena, we may now think of taking, is to find the numbers in (XX.). We begin with R2hagdit =) ,2h. agdir Wh+ 2ag. di~r k' R (rj k)n+]~ o ad(r5k Problem b. TCofind iR2h agdi(r, k)n, the number of (1 I+k)-partitioned r-gons, built on the n-gonal nucleus, and having h agonal and h diagonal axes of reversion, all clear. There are, in every one of these, 2h equidistant terminations of diagonal axes, between n *n which intervene sides of the n-gon; the central side of these is bisected by an f n. agonal axis, wherefore 2h is an odd number. If we mark this central side as the nth of the n-gon, we see on either side of it (2hI) sides between it and a termination of a diagonal axis. This nth side is one of 2h equidistant sides of the n-gon, bisected by terminations of agonal axes, namely the n 2n 3 ... nth sides, which are all unloaded, being sides both of the r-gon and the n-gon. The n_1 sides on either side of the nth are loaded, the first and (n1)th with a certain el-partitioned (2 + a1)-gon, so as to form a configuration bisected by the agonal axis between them; the second and (n-2)th by a e2-partitioned (2+a,)-gon placed in like reversible manner, and so on; inl such a way as to satisfy the equations following, r=n+4h(a +a2+.. +an-2h)(A 4h (A.) lk=n-2h+4A(e +e2+ .. +e,!-)2 where am `0, and em: am1, since no (2 + ar)-gon can have more than amdiagonals drawn none crossing another; wherefore if-am.= 0, em 1. Thes 2h These polygons ala2, &c. are laid on in the same manner to correspond about the wth 2nth, &c. sides; i. e. they fill up the 4/h intervals between agonal and diagonal axes, making a configuration reversible about any one of them. XXV. The equations (A.) must be satisfied, because the n summits of the n-gon, with the a, summits added 4h times in the (2I+ a1)-gon, and the am summits added 4k times in 2 "2 228 REV. T. P. KIRKMAN ON THIE K-PARTITIONS OF TEE R-GON AND R-ACE. the (2+a.)-gon, must make up the r summits of the r-gon. And, supposing that .a everywhere >0, the n 2h loaded sides of the n-gon, with the em diagonals of every (2+ar)-gon 4h times laid on, must make up the k diagonals of the r-gon. And if a O, in which case the mth and (n-m)th sides of the n-gon are unloaded, whereby 41k sides besides the 2h above-mentioned remain sides common to the r-gon and the n-gon, the appearance of em=-1 corrects the error made by counting those 4h sides for diagonals of the r-gon, and the second equation still remains true, however many of the numbers al, a2, &c. =0. But these equations are impossible, and R0agdi(r, k)n_0 unless r-n, n-2h, and k-n+2h are all multiples of 4h. Consider any single solution of the equation (A.), and let N be an r-gon bearing, on the mth side everywhere reckoned in both directions from the one bisected by an agonal axis, a (2 +am)-gon having em diagonals. Whatever be the posture of those em diago. nals, and whatever be the character of the (2 +am)-gon, the figure is reversible at least about h agonal and h diagonal axes. And let C be the configuration read in N about the agonal axis through the nth side of the n-gon. XXVI. Let, next, any disturbance be made in the arrangement of the em diagonals in one or more of these imposed polygons, so that the reversible character about the 2k axes be preserved, and the diagonals of the (2+a.)-gon on both sides of any axis shall form pairs making angles bisected by the intervening axis of reversion. The solution before us of (A.) being undisturbed in both values and order of the numbers a, el, a2 e2, &c., we can combine every (1+em)-division of the (2+am)-gon in the interval withy every (1 +ep)-division of the (2+a,)-gon, &c.; that is, we can make C take D(2+a,, e,).D(2+a2, e2).D(2+a3, e,).. .D(2+a.-_2h, e-)27, =An-2h 4h 4h 4h different forms, by mere variation of arrangement of diagonals, the same variation being made about every agonal axis, and consequently the same variation occurring about every diagonal axis. Of these AX-2h configurations no two can be alike; for the intervals of 44 n2h sides between two adjoining axes are irreversible configurations, if we look at the 4kh axes which limit them, because one is an agonal and the other a diagonal axis; so that, in fact, no disturbance of one or more diagonals of N can produce N' a repetition of N. If the limiting axes were alike, it might possibly occur that N' should be a reflexion of N, the configuration of one read from right to left in the interval being that of the other read from left to right. It is to be observed here, and in all products that we may handle of the form of An-2h, that when am=0 and consequently em= -1, D(2+am, em) is either to be omitted, 4h or counted unity, so that AO is always =1. XXVII. Next, let us make a variation in our solution of equation (A.), either by altering two or more values of a, a2.. or of e, e2.. or of both; or by exchanging the places of certain values without altering them. It is evident that C', the result of such REV. T. P. KIRKMAN ON TlhIg 1-PARTITIONS OF THI R-GON AMD R-ACE. 229 disturbance of the solution, must differ from every C that we have before regarded about the axis through the nth side of the n-gon; for it has no longer the same polygons in the same places of the interval between the axes. We have either changed the order of the imposed polygons, or we have in certain places put a (1+e,)-partitioned (2+ a)-gon which was not employed in the construction of C, for a (1+em)-partitioned (2+a7a)-gon, which was. Whatever be the solution we work from, we shall be able to produce from it, by mere disturbances of diagonals in the imposed polygons, A7-2h distinct configurations, all different from the An-.2h counted before, and all the r-gons thus produced will 4h have the property of being reversible about A agonal and hI diagonal axes. And it is evident that every configuration about an agonal axis of any (1+k)-paxtitioned r-gon, having h agonal and h diagonal axes of reversion, will be produced from some solution of equations (A.), and some arrangement of diagonals in the imposed polygons. If, then, we denote by G. An-2h& the sum of the products An-2h made from every solu.4h tion of equations (A.), every change, either in value or order, of a, ea, a, e2, &c. being counted as a solution we find that .NA,2h many terms of which will be equal numbers, 4h is the exact number of configurations about an agonal axis which can be seen on any (1+k)-partitioned r-gon having It agonal and It diagonal clear axes of reversion. Now no ago-diagonally reversible has two configurations about agonal axes; and every (1 +k)-partitioned r-gon having ih agonal and ih diagonal axes, is reversible about 7i agonal and h diagonal axes, whatever positive number i may be; for it has h equidistant agonal axes, and between every pair of these (i -1) more agonal axes, and it has At diagonal axes, because iA diagonal axes bisect the angles between the ik agonal ones. Hence it follows that Yn-2h= h i R2ihdzdi(r, k), 4k n2ih r n k -n+ 2ih where i is every whole number giving 4ih -n, and -nih -positive integers; conditions necessary to the existence of equations (A.).

For a simple and complete example, to be carried out through all our investigation, we may take the partitions of the octagon. Here we are to seek R2hagdi(8, k)n. Evidently n < 8 (if k> O), and =6 or =4. When n=6, 4h =1, the only value, gives h=1, and R2agdi(8, k)6=O whatever be k, because is not integer. 4 4-2k6 When n= 4 has no integer value >0; wherefore, since r> n, R2hagdi(8, k)4= 0, for all values of k. Hence R2hagdi(8 )O whatever be the nucleus, except that R8agdi(8 0)8 -1 (art. III.). XXIX. Problem c. To find R hagdi(r, k)n, the nurnber of (1 +k)-partitioned r-gons, built on an n-gonal nucleus, having h loaded agonal, and h clear diagonal, axes of reversion. The investigation to be made differs from that in the five preceding articles in that the 2h sides of the n-gon, bisected by the agonal axes, are all loaded with a certain (1 +%0)-partitioned (4+ 2,0,)-gon A,, having at least one agonal axis of reversion (Theorem G.). This must be so posited that its agonal axis shall be in a line with that of the n-gon (Theorem N.), and must be placed alike on the 2h equidistant sides, since all agonal axes of the r-gon must bisect the same configuration at each end (Theorem C.). The remaining sides of the n-gon may be loaded, the mth from A0, with any (1+ em)-partitioned (or divisioned) (2 +a..)-gon so as to form a figure reversible about the 2h axes, and so that the equations following be satisfied: r=n+2h(2+2 o)+4h(al+at2+.. +an }2h 4h1 i> . * * * (A'.) k~n+2hls,+4h e~-2.-en-2h; 4h where am.O, em:am-1; and em=-1, if am=O; the numbers o and s being any that we may select from our register of polygons having at least one agonal axis, which is supposed complete for values of (2+2cvo) not greater than All that is said of the loading of the n-2k sides between the axes, and about thn .Altati ado telaiho 4h the import and necessity of equations (A.), applies to equations (A'.). The sides being thus loaded, we have an r-gon which has only clear diagonal axes, and is reversible about 2h equidistant and alternate agonal and diagonal axes. Leaving now the 2h agonally reversible (1+ 2a0)-gons undisturbed, we can vary the positions of the diagonals, exactly as in (XXVI.), so as to produce about the agonal axis through the nth side of the r-gon D(2+al, el).D(2+a2, e).....

And every one of these may be varied again by changing the posture of the (4+2ao0)-gon, if it has a second configuration about an agonal axis, so that this axis shall come into a line with that of the n-gon, or by exchanging the (4+2a,0)-gon for any other that is also (1+?,0)-partitioned and has an agonal axis. The number of variations in our power by disturbance of the (4+2a,)-gons alone, is M,, { 2Rm1(4 + 2c0) s+R2maidi(4 + 2 a0) } = HI because each n-agonally reversible has two configurations about agonal axes and thus admits of two postures, while each ago-diagonally reversible has only one; whatever be the number m of agonal axes (Theorem A.). Thus we see, that for every solution of equations (A'.) that we can write doWn, all values and orders of the numbers counting in the solution, we can make H . An-2h 4las different configurations about the axis through the nth side of the n-gon. The proof that there are no two of them alike need not be repeated here fiom art. XVI. If then Y. _Ln-2A 4/It denote the sum of those products HIA made from every solution of equations (A'.), this number is that of the r-gons (1 +k)-partitioned, and having It agonal and It diagonal axes of reversion, the latter only being clear axes, which are constructible on the n-gonal nucleus. This is shown exactly as in art. XXVII. And by the reasoning of that article we obtain .

But we cannot find RmO(r, k)n by these formulae, there being no such division reducible to a nucleus (VIII.). Thus we have found (XLIX., L.) Ithmo (r, k). for any value of n> 2. LII. All the numbers R of article XX. have now been determined, for every value of h when the axes are not all loaded, and for every value of h>I when they are all loaded, the nucleus being n-gonal, and n<43. We have next to enumerate the doubly and singly reversibles which are built on the 2-gonal nucleus, that is, upon a line, which is of course a drawn axis of reversion of the r-gon, and also the singly reversibles which have an e-scored axis. These have no proper nucleus (Theorem K). These r-gons now to be discussed fall into the classes following, R (r, k)2, R(r, k)2, Rli(r, k)2, R0~r 0)Rirk mtA of which the first two have a drawn diagonal axis standing as a perpendicular score upon an undrawn axis (Theorem G); the third has a single drawn diagonal axis (Theorem G); and the fourth, fifth and sixth have a single undrawn and scored axis of reversion (Theorem K). The subscript 2 in the first three symbols shows that the nucleus is a drawn line, which may be considered as a 2-gon reversible about a diagonal and an agonal axis. Problem o. To find R2agdi(r, k)2, the (1 +k)-partitioned r-gons built on a nucleus-line to have a diagonal and an agonal axis of reversion. If the drawn diagonal be erased, the figure will be still reversible about the same two axes undrawn, for (Theorem B, VI.) the erasure has not disturbed the symmetry about either axis. But the erasure may have restored the symmetry about some n-gonal nucleus of which that erased line is a clear diagonal axis (Theorem R, XVIII.). And every r-gon which has a clear diagonal axis perpendicular to an agonal one, that is, every one of IR(4h+2)agdi(r, k1)n and of R(4h+2)agdi(r, kcl), whatever h or n may be, if n 2 (Cor. 1, VII.), will give us one and only one (Theorem G) of R2agdi(r, i)2, by the drawing of any diagonal axis of reversion; for all these axes bisect the same configuration. Wherefore Rag(r, f)2 = n{ R(4h+2)agdi(r, k-j1)+R(4h+2)agdi(r, kl)n} including all values of h, and of n> 2 in our register; n of course being even, else it could have no diameter.

To find R2di(r, k)2, the number of (1 +k)fpartitioned r-gons built on a line-nutcleus, to have two diagonal axes of reversions. 2L 2 252 REV. T. P. KIRKMAN ON THE K-PARTITIONS 01 THE R-GON AND R-ACE. If the drawn diagonal axis be erased, the figure still remains reversible about the same axis, as in the preceding article, and we may have restored the symmetry about some n-gonal nucleus of which that erased line is a clear diagonal axis. Every r-gon of the number R2'idi (r, k-I)n will give us two of R2di(r, k)2, for we can draw a diagonal axis bisecting either of its configurations; and every r-gon of the number (R42'&d+Ilt4 gd +Rldhcagd)(rI Ok-I)nl which have all a clear diagonal axis at right angles to a diagonal axis (VI. VII. Cor. 1), will give us one of R2di(r, k)2, by drawing any diagonal axis of reversion, which can be drawn without meeting diagonals; i. e. R(r, k)2 =Yhyln{2 2C d(r, kl)n+ i^' (r, k-I)n+ 0c gd(r, k-Il)n Rdc gd(r k---1) }j; comprehending all the values of t> 0 and n> 2 in our register of reversibles.

To find R.di(r, k)2, the number of (1 +k)partitioned singly reversi r-gons having a drawn diagonal axis. If this axis be erased, the figure F remains reversible about the same diagonal axis, and the erasure may have restored the symmetry about some n-gonal nucleus of which that erased line is a clear diagonal axis, one of an odd number of axes of reversion in F; for if this number were even, there would then be an axis (VI.) perpendicular to the erased one, about which the symmetry would not be disturbed by the erasure, so that the figure before the erasure must have been at least doubly reversible, contrary to hypothesis. Now every one of the number R(2 +l)di(r, k 1). will give one (Theorems B, G), and only one, of Rdi(r, k)2, by drawing of any of its axes of reversion, because all these carry the same configuration. Consequently Rdi(r, k),=Eh,.R(2h + I' (r, k 1),, comprehending all values of h including h= 0, and all of n, in our register of k-partitions. ilence we obtain (XLVI.), IRdi(8, 5)2 =Rd(8, 4)4 2, Rdi(8, 3)2= Rd (8, 2)6+Rd (8, 2)4 = 2.

The number Rag(r, k)' is obtained by Theorems P, Q, S, exactly as kRoo(r, k) was obtained, except that the number of angles of the nucleus from which on one side of the clear axis e scores can be drawn, is in the first, instead of in the second. 22 That is, Ra-?r)'f ](2 Er (n-4)e ~ 1t+l)agr k-e)nf_ ,,R(o2h+-`)a(r1 k), where again the omission of the subscript n shows that constructions upon all nuclei are included.

Whatever e may be, the constructions of Theorem R are enumerated by subtracting the symmetrical arrangements of the e scores from the whole number of arrangements, and dividing the remainder by two; for every unsymmetrical one occurs twice in this remainder, once as read from each end of the scored axis, which readings are the two configurations of the singly reversible about the axis (Theorem C)* 254 REV.

We have now to investigate the number of irreversible (1 +k)-partitions of the r-gon. And when we have determined Im+2(r, k)., m=O, the equations of art. XXIII. will enable us to complete the tedious solution of our problem. It is necessary to demonstrate the theorems following. THEOREM V. Every h-ly irreversible partition of an r-yon, if h > 2, and every doubly irreversible partition in which a diameter of the r-yon is not drawn, is regularly built on a polygonal nucleus. For in each of the h sequences of configuration (art. III.) in the circuit of the r-gon, we see f marginal faces. These being all erased, we see an r'-gon (r <r) with JZi fewer diagonals, and still h sequences, for those of the r-gon have been treated alike. If this r'-gon is reversibly partitioned, it is not singly reversible, because it has repeated sequences (V.); therefore the theorem is proved by XII.; for there is no drawn diameter by hypothesis. If the r'-gon be still irreversible, it has h' sequences (h'.h), from which marginal faces can be removed as before; and thus we shall finally reduce the figure, either to a reversibly-partitioned r"-gon, or to one having no marginal faces, i. e. to an n-gonal nucleus. And by reversing the process of reduction, the r-gon can be regularly constructed on that nucleus. Q. E. D. LXIII. THEOREM W. If the nucleus line of a doubly irreversible r-gon built on it be erased, the figure becomes 2h-ly reversible or else 2h-ly irreversible, and has no drawn diam meter. For it has still two irreversible sequences, occupying each half the circuit of the r-gon, since the two sequences terminated by the nucleus-line have been treated alike by the erasure; wherefore it can neither be oddly reversible nor oddly irreversible (Obs. 1, 3, IV.; and 5,VII.). And evidently the r-gon cannot have a drawn diameter meeting its nucleus line. Cor. The r-gon, after the erasure, is one of those reducible to a polygonal nucleus. THEOREM X. If in any 2m-ly reversible, or 2m-ly irreversible, kopartition of an r-gon, a diameter be drawn which Its not an axis of reversion, and which meets no diagonal, the figure becomes a doubly irreversible (I +k)-partition of the r-gon, built on that drawn line. For such a drawn line disturbs the symmetry about every axis of a reversible, because it is (VI.) perpendicular to none of them; therefore the result is not reversible. And every 2m-ly reversible or 2m-ly irreversible has an irreversible sequence occupying half its circuit (III, V.), beginning at any angle not on an axis of reversion; therefore the result is not singly irreversible. And as there is no other sequence terminated by or exhibiting a drawn diameter, since two cannot be drawn, the result has no sequence REV. T. P. KIRKMAN ON THE K-PARTITIONS OF THE R-GON AND R-ACE. 259 more than twice repeated, and is doubly irreversible. And evidently the figure is built on the drawn line, by applying to it the same polygon on both sides, so as not to give a reversible result. LIV. Problem u. To find Ih(r, k)n, (i> 1, n-2), the number of h-ly irreversible (1 +k)partitions of the r-gon, which are built on the n-gonal nucleus. The construction differs from that of reversibles, in that the (I +em)-partitioned *(2+am)-gon which is laid on the mth side of the n-gon in the first interval of n sides, is laid also on the mth side of every interval, so that the series of loads imposed is h times repeated, and not reverted. The result will be an r-gon in whose circuit a sequence occupying X sides of the nucleus is h times repeated. The equations to be satisfied are r=n+h(a +a2+ +.. +a) k=n+h(el +e2+.. +e. exactly as in our previous constructions. We take any one solution, and lay on the polygons, and then make every possible change in the arrangement of the diagonals of the imposed polygons; this gives us D(2+a1, el)D(2+a,, e2)..D(2+anj en)=An different sequences read in the r-gon upon the first n sides of its nucleus, which are all h times repeated in the same order in the circuit of the r-gon. We then take every other solution of (E.) that can arise from changing either the values or order of the numbers a, a2.., el e2 .; and forming a similar product from each solution, products which will some of them be equal to each other, we shall have enumerated in the sum E~no every possible sequence that can be read on X successive sides of the n-gonal nucleus of any (1+k)-partitioned r-gon, which has that sequence h times repeated in its circuit. And no two of these sequences can be alike, because they are either made from different solutions of (E.), or have a different arrangement of diagonals in the imposed polygons. Now every hi-ly irreversible (1 +k)-partition of the r-gon has hi and no more, of these sequences; for it has a different i-ple sequence of vertices commencing at every one of n successive vertices, and no more, reading always in one direction, because the sequence beginning at the ( +1) th vertex is identical with that commencing at the first; and this -ple sequence ofn vertices is h times repeated in the circuit, because a simple sequence 2 M2 260 REV. T. P. KIRKMAN ON THE K-PARTITIONS OF THE R-GON AND R-ACE. is hi times repeated. And as the hi-ly irreversible has the same sequences reversed on its other face, giving h different aspects which we have all constructed as read from the first side of the n-gon in one direction, we have had this same hi-ly irreversible 2n:hi times before us among our results. Again, every hi-ly reversible (I+k)-partitioned r-gon has been times brought before us in our Ywln constructions. For this has a different i-ple sequence reversible or h irreversible of h vertices of the n-gonal nucleus commencing at any one of hi successive vertices, and we never see a sequence repeated in it till we have read over an interval equal to that between two alternate axes, that is an interval of sides of the. n-gon (art. V.). This i-ple sequence is h times repeated in the circuit of the r-gon; so that we have counted this hi-ly reversible h times among those constructed from equation (E.). Wherefore ln i J2n i(r~ k)n+ n Rhi(r, A) and 11(r, 4)n= 2n lz/n -Ei(a (i + l) P(+ )h(r, k)n + hi Rti(r, k),)) (i > O ) LXV. The highest value of h in (E.) comes from putting the subindex a =1, or h=n. This gives Pn(r, k)n-=I{D (r n, k-n) -Rn(r k) } a given number, since Rn(r, k). is found in our register. Next putting X =2, or whatever next factor n may have, we can obtain Ik(r, k). for every value of h> 1 that is a divisor of the three numbers r, k and n. Since h> 1, n> 2, r, k and n are none of them prime; the only values of Ih(8, k). that give them all divisible by h, and kj> 8-3, are 12(8, 2)6, 12(8, 2)4, 12(8, 4)4 and I4(8, 4)4. By the last written formula, I(8, 4)4= 2{D(3, O)-R4(8, 4)4} = (1-1)=0, for 12(8, 2), we have three solutions, (=_3) 8=6+2(1+0+0)= &c. 2=6+2(0-1-1)= &c. giving 2h3=3D(3, 0)=3, and as R2(8, 2)6=1, 12(8, 2)6=% {36sR2(8, 2)6} =?(33)-O?. REV. T. P. KIRMAN ON THE K-PARTITIONS OF THE R-GON AND R-ACE. 261 For 12(8, 2)4 we have 2 8=4+2.(1 +1)=4+2(2 +0)= 4+2(0+2) 2 4+2(0-1)=4+2(-1+0) 2=A 2D(4, 0) =2, and R2(8, 2)4= 1, ale I(8, 2) =2 {2-241 * 1 = 0. For 12(8, 4), we have (h , 8=4+2(1+1)=4+2(0+2)=4+2(2+0) 4=4+2(0+0)=4+2(-1+1)=4+2(1-1) MA2=D(3, 0)D(3, 0)+2D(4, 1)=1+4_=5 and R4(8, 4),=1, whence 12(8, 4)4= 8 25* which is the only form of Ih(8, k)nl for A>1, n>2. LXVI. Problem w. To find P2(r, k)2, the doubly irreversible (1 +k)-partitions qf the r-gon, which have a nucleus line. It is proved in Theorems W and X, that these are all obtained by drawing a diameter b which is not an axis of reversion in one of the r-gons 12m (r, k1) and R2m(r, k1),; and that any such diameter drawn in any one of these gives us one of P2(r, k)2. And it is evident that w is a diameter of the nucleus about which all is symmetrical (Cor. LXIII.). When no diameter of the nucleus is a diagonal axis of reversion of the r-gon, every diameter that can be drawn is such a line I. Now in I2P(r, k 1). you may draw z from any one 0 of vertices of the nucleus, and from no more, because the configuration about 0 is repeated 2h times, about a vertex in each of the 2h repeated sequences. In a reversible partition no diameter of the nucleus is a diagonal axis of reversion, unless it be. a clear axis. Therefore, in h. agdi (r, k-I)n+ R12agdi(r, k1)n +R2hag(r, k-1)1, whether the axes be clear or not in the last one, you can draw b from any one of n vertices of the r-gon; for none of the partitions in these classes have a clear diagonal axis, and each vertex s in one of the 4h intervals between.two adjacent axes begins a different sequence, which does not occur reverted till you come to e', equidistant with s from the axis between them.

As a further illustration of these formulae and their use, and for a comparison of methods, it will be worth our while to deduce the seven partitions of the 9-gon, and the eight partitions of the 10-gon, which are obtained by way of example in the memoir referred to, in the first article. First, to find -Rk(9, 6) and IA(9, 6). As the 9-gon is divided into triangles, there can be only two nuclei, a triangle or a line. We ask, then, what are Rk(9, 6)3 and RJ(9, 6)2 , By Theorem E, the axes are monogonal only, and Rhrno(9, 6)3 is what we are seeking. By Problem m, RJmo(9 6)3 0, R1 m0(9, 6)3=D(5, 2)=5; and by Problem n, RO no(9, 6) (2Rna+R2ragdi)(4, 1)=0, R2di(4, 1)2=1 being the only entry in our register under (4, 1). .)n-k For Rmo(9, 6)3, we have, by equations (D'.), 2,-1 =h. 9' 3+2+2m,,+2al, 6=3+ 6,+2e, 4+2ao=8-2a1, Al=D(2+ao, el), so 3-2e, Rlo(9, 6)3= Y. {1(2R1 a9+R2Magd)(8-2al 3-2eJ)}.D1(2+a1, e1). The only values of el are 0 or 1; if el=1, a, <2, if e,=0, a,<1. And as we have nothing in our register under (Rmag or Rmagdi)((4, 1) or (6, 3)), Rmo(9, 6)3= 0, and (Problems o, p, q) R(9, 6)2 = 0; wherefore R(9, 6) = Remo(9, 6)3= 5. Next to find Ih(9, 6),; by Problem u, =If9 632D(49 I)_ R3( 9, 6)3}= 2(2-0)=1, the subtracted term having just been proved to be zero. And as 9 is odd (Problem w). 12(9, 6)2 =-0 wherefore (Problem x), 1(9, 6) = {D(9, 6) -9R(9, 6)1 _I3(9, 6)= 18j429-95-6-1=} 21. This agrees with the results at p. 409 of my former memoir, saving an error of transcription in the seventh line from the bottom, in which + 1. ii(8, 2, 0) is omitted from the value of I(10, 2) as it stands above (line 14).

By Theorems M, E (XIV., IX), no axis can be agonal, or monogonal; we seek then IRdi(10, 7)3, R2di(10, 7)2, iRd(10, 7)2, and Rd (10, 7). R"di(10, 7)3=0 by Problem i, because n is odd; and RlRdi(10, 7)3=0 for the same reason, as is also R'zdi(10, 7)3. Therefore Rhdi(10, 7)3= 0.

R2agdi(l0, 7T-e=0; for this can only be R2adg(l 0, 7 e)6, for a reason just given; but (Problem c) 7-e-6 is even, therefore e=1, and as h=1, = 4h equations (A'.) become 10 6+ .2(2+0)+4. 0, and k=6= 6+2 .2?4. -1, i. e. in H, Y=-0, ;2, or a 4-agon has two diagonals not crossing, which is absurd. 270 REV.

NoX in R~di(10, 7-e)n (Problem'l), when h is odd, 10, 7-e and n are not all divisible by 2k? if n> 6; for n<10. And in R'di(10, 7 -e)6, h is either 1 or 3. For h=3 the formula for Randi gives R3di(10, 7-e)6=O, because +6 is not integer; and for h=1, 3-3 10= 6+2. (al +a2+a3) 7-e=6+2.(e, +e2+e3); the solutions are 10-6 2=1+1+0, or =2+0+0 1 e-=2(0+()-1), or -2(1-1-1), or =2(0--1), the second line of which is absurd, if e< 3. But for e> 2, the multiplier (62) 3M . Therefore i is not 6. 4 LIet then n=4, and seek R"di(10, 7-e)4, for h odd. If h =1, the formula for Rindi R21i~~~l 10+4. 4 gives lidi(l0, 7-e)4=O, because is not integer. Then 2= 2, =1, and we have for e=l, 10=4+2. (2+1)=4+2(3+0) 6=4+2 (1+0)=4+2(2-1), giving four solutions; and for e=3, the multiplier (-2! ) vanishes. These four are then the only solutions, and Y(A2)=2D(4, 1)D(3, 0)+2D(55 2)=2(2+5)=14; whence Re (10, 6)4=1{ 14E(2R(i+l)di+ Ri+R' agdi+Riagdi)(10 6)4 } w.8here (i > 0). No(w R(i+1)di(10, 6)4= 0 (Problem 1), because 10 and 6 and 4 have no common measure 2(i+ 1). R 2di (10, 6)4= 0 (Problem k), because 10 is not divisible by 4. jt2i "gdi (10, 6)4=0 (Problem b), because 10 is no multiple of 4i. RC52aiagdi* (10, 6)4=0 (Problem c), because 10-4 is no multiple of 4i. Therefore R'(1 0 6)4-214=7=Rd(10, 7), anid R(10, 7)=Rd(10 ? 7)2+Rdi(10, 7)=2Rdi(10, 6)4=14. LXXII. We have next to determine IP(1 0, 7), t> 1. The formulae for In (Problem u) give 10+3. I'(10, 7)3=0, because -, is no integer. REV. T. P. KIRKMAN ON THE K-PARTITIONS OF T1lE R-GON AND R-ACE. 271. And (Problem w) 1(1 ,1) n2hzI(10, 6)X+-h R2h~agdi( 0, 6) } the quantities here omitted from the formula being Rwohadi(10, 6)= 0, because 10 is not divisible by 4hi (Problem e). R2hag (10, 6)r.=0, for the same reason (Problems f, g, h). pdhagdi(Jj3 6) 0, as it has been proved in the preceding article. R2hagdi(10, 6)= -0 because 10 is not divisible by 4h (Problem b). R~i'di R2hdi= 0, for the same reason (Problems k, 1). Now the equations of Problem u for 12h(10, 6)n are those of Problem 1 for Rh(10, 6) and we have proved in the preceding article that h=-1 and n=4 are the only values affording a solution; which gives 2 (An) =I(A2)=14. Wherefore (Problem w) (i > 0), I2(10, 6)4= 8 {14-.1i(2i 1(i+ 12(l 0, 6)4 +R2i(10, 6)4)} 10+ 4 The formula for IP(r, k)n shows that I4(10, 6)4=0, for is not integer, and we have just proved that R24(10, 6).=0 under every form except R2a'14di(10, 6)n, which remains to be determined. In Problem d we see thathr-n-2h is divisible by 4h; wherefore n=4 and A= 1. Therefore, by the formula for Rin, R2agdi(l0 6)4=nm'lZ mo1?(5, 2) Rmo(5, 2)=1 as is easily verified. Consequently I2(10, 6)4=28 { 14 ....4R i(10, 6)4} 4 14-2 and 12(10, 7)=12(10, 7)2-4I2(10, 6)4+4 R2agdi(10, 6)4=6?1=7, whence,. finally (Problem x), I(10, 7)=-2l {D(101 7)_ 11R(10, 7) _ _~2_0I2(101 7)J=-1-f(1430-10.1410.7)=61. And this enumeration of the 8-partitions of the 10-gon agrees with that at p. 410 ()f my memoir mentioned in the first article. It is evident that this last example would have caused far less trouble, if we had had our register of partitions filled up for inspection up to the 7-partitions of the 10-goil. There is little difficulty, as I have verified to some extent, in framing, by the aid of the results here given, algebraical expressions, containing circulating functions for Rh(s, k) and Ih(r, il), in terms of r and k only, and thence by addition, complete expressions of the (1+k)-partitions of the r-gon. But the subject has been pursued far enough for one communication. 272 REV. T P. KIRKMAN ON THE K-PARTITIONS OF THE R-GON AND R-ACE. LXXIII. The notation above employed for the partitions of the r-gon is applicable, with hardly any change, to express those of the r-ace. An h?,-Iy reversible (1+k)-partition of the r-ace has h axial planes of reversion, which are achlorial, diachoial, or nonoclwrial, according as they cut none, two, or one only of the faces (Xwpia) about the r-ace. The k partitioning lines may conveniently be called diap)i)eds, or shorter, diapeds, being each in two planes about the r-ace, as a diagonal is in two summits of the r-gon. Putting Ac, Di, and Mo, for achorial, diachorial and monochorial, we have the following account to give, N standing for the nucleus n-ace, of the (1+k)-partitions of the r--ace: R27 . Ac. D'i(r, k)N = R22h. ag . di(r, k), gRh.Ac (r, c)N=Rkag (r, k), Rh . Iv (r, k)N= Rh.di (r, k), Rh. Mo ( k)N=Rh * mo (r, k) ,
