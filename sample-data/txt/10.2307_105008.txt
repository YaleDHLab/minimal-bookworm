S. with a Table of the Value of Annuities on Lives, by Mr. James Dodson, Master of the Royal Mathematical School in Christ's-Hospital, and F. R. S. Reverend Sir, AS I have made a great many calculations, relative to Annuities on Lives, and have otherwise contributed, as much as was in my Power, to facilitate the performance of such, I thought it, almost, a duty incumbent on me, to compute the values of them according to your curious Table of the Decrements of Life, inserted in the Philosophical Transactions; accordingly I have inclosed a table of them, and if you find it will bear examination I desire you to communicate it to the Royal Society, in order (if approved of) to its being inserted, as an appendix to your letter to the President. I am, Read Dec. 16. 1756. Reverend Sir, Your most obedient and most humble Servant, James Dodson. Christ's-Hospital, Dec. 8, 1756.
