THIS curious Fossil seems to be composed of a stony Matter like Marble, which has penetrated the Cells of the Nautilus while in its natural State. The Diaphragms or Partitions remain still distinct and visible. The different Colour of the stony Matter in some Cells of a dark-brown or Hair-Colour, in others of a lightbrown or Ash-Colour, with the natural Polish of the Outside, gives it a beautiful Appearance; as it is represented in the annexed Print (See TAB. Fig. 2.) where it is drawn of its natural Size in three different Views. Shewn May 5. 1748. A shews the Side View of it. B the fore Part. C the back Part. C. M. It [321] It was found in Pool's Hole in Derbyshire. Its Sutures or Diaphragms resemble those of some of the larger Cornua Ammonis; but its Shape bespeaks it to be a Species of Nautilus; and it is thought to be a Non-descript, both in its natural and fossil State.
