Part of a Letter from Mr Thoresby, F. R. S. to the Publisher, giving a further account of the same. T H E Person you inquire of, is, I am sure an ingenious, obliging and good man, what you desire a transcript of, I here send you in his own words. ` Near the River Welland, that runs thro the Town of ` Spalding in Lincolnshire, at the depth of above 8 or ` 10 foot, there were found Jettys, as they call them, ` to keep up the old Rivers Bank, and the head of a Tun` nel that emptied the Land-water into the old River; and ` at a considerable distance from the present River, I guess ` 20 or 30 yards, there were dug up (about the like depth) ` several old Boats,which things shew that anciently the Ri` ver was either much wider than now it is,or ran in another ` place, or both. On the other, viz. the North West side of ` the River,and more upwards in the Town, were digg'd up ` (at about the afore-mentioned depth) the remains of old ` Tanvats or Pits, a great quantity of Ox-horns, and the ` Shoe-soles, which I told you of, and I think the very ` Tanners knobs, &c. which things shew, that the surface ` of the Country lay anciently much lower than now it ` does, and has been raised by the Seas throwing in its Sand ` in the Maritime parts (now most inhabited) and by the ` Moor (1159) ` Moor or rotted Sedge in the fenny parts next the high ` Country; the whole Level is about 50 miles in length, and ` 30 miles over in the broadest parts. No Record (Printed ` or MS) or Tradition whatsoever, (that I ever heard of) ` tell us when these Mutations here discoverable hap` pened. ` One thing further I will add, that lately at the laying ` of the present new Sluice or Goat (as they call it) at the ` end of Hamorebeck, at its fall into Boston Haven, taking up ` the foundation of the old Goat, they met with the roots ` of Trees, many of them issuing from their several Boles ` or Trunks, spread in the Ground, which when they had ` taken up (Roots and Earth they grew in) they met with ` a solid Gravelly and Stony Soil of the high Country kind, ` (but black and discoloured by the change that had beflan ` it) upon which hard Earth they laid the Foundation of this ` new Goat, where these Roots were dug up, was certainly ` the surface of the old Country, the certain depth whereof ` I cannot now tell you, but that it was much deeper than ` that at Spalding, as the Land is there at present higher. ` The Archimedean Screw, or Screw-like Trunk or Cylinder, ` by which the Workmen cleared themselves of Water was ` very pretty. The matter of fact in these Relations is indisputable, this worthy Person being an Eye-witness, whose Letter coming to hand when I was reading Mr Rays Physico-Theological Tract, concerning the great changes made in the Terraqueous Globe, I took it for an experimental confirmation of his Sentiments, that the great Level of the Fens running thro Holland in Lincolnshire, the Isle of Ely in Cambridgeshire and Marshland in Norfolk, was sometimes part of the Sea, and atterated by Earth brought down by Floods from the upper Grounds, by the great quantity of Mud there subsiding, which by degrees raised it up. When you see or write to that Ingenious Gentleman, please to present my humble Service to him(1160) <inferred>h</inferred> im,and acquaint him herewith: I have sometimes thought o have sent him an additional List of Local Words, which the before-mentioned Goat (Eboracensibus Goit) puts me in mind of; the form of the shoe was much like those found with some Urns at Kirby Thore in Westmorland, as describ'd in the Phil. Trans. No 158.
