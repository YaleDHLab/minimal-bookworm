Y. Pirther Particulars respecEng tbe Observatory at Benaress of wbich an Account, zuith Plates I'S gtren b.y Si-r Rober-t Barker, in the LXVIIth Vol. of the Philosophical Transactions. In a Letter to William Marsdens Esq. F. R. S. fro-m John Lloyd Williams, Esq. of Berlares. Read January 31, :1793-e DEAR SIR, 1 conformittr with yout request, I have snow the pleasure of nsending you an account of the measurement of -the different -parts of the Baenares obsenatory, called ma!un-mu7tdel) as taken by myself, with a two-foot rllle, and a rod of ten feet very ;exactly divided. An aecounFt tof the use of the different in zstruments, though very imperit, was giergn me on ffie spotS by several learned 5Brafhmins who attended me; one of whom is professor of astronotmy iLa the new founded college at Be mres. Tlley -all agreed that this obseraratory never srag useds nor did they5thqnk it capable d being used, for -any nice observations, axld b;elieve thtat it was built more fbr -ostentattion than Sthe yomotion of useful skn-owledge. In m-yFinquwiry into tlle parlars of-the building,I have Ubeen assisted by nzy friend t e Nabob ALI ISSAS1M KAUN) satzd I believe this account :Rnay be rqlied Â£>n fMr v7ILLIAMS'S ,further ParticuZawrsA. The larg-e quadrant, c:alled in Arabic, IzootoopbedeS in Hindoo, droop the nam-e of the north polar starw This instrument is built of stone, fixecI in InortarS arld clamped with iron in a very clumsy manller; between-most of the stones are spaces of It6 part of an -inch.

This instrument is called cvnd-brzt, or cranti-brit, buic I could not lear< the use of it. D. A double circular wall, with a round pillar in the centre, as described by Sir ROBERT BARKER. The floor being abroken, and uneven, renders the height of the outer wall irregular, but it measured from 8 feet 1 inch, to 8 feet g ilachesX diameter inside, 27 feet 62 inches; thickness of the wall, 2 feet. The inner wall is w8 feet within, thickness of this wall, 1 foot Sj inches. The diameter of the centre pillar, 3 feet yg inchese At the four cardinal points, on the top of the outer wallS are four iron pins, with small holes in them through which, the Pundits say, wires are designed to be drawn at the time of observation, which wires irltersect each other at the centre of the pillar. The tops of both the walls are graduated, or divided into degrees; and it is said, that by the shadow of these wires falling on the walls the surl's declination is found. In addition to the foregoing, which are described in the plates alluded to, on the south-east quarter of the building is a large black stone, 6 feet 2 inches diameter, fronting the west, it stands on an inclined plane. I could not learn the use o-f this instrumentv but was informed that it never had beerl completed There is no other buildirlg of any consequence, nor does it appear there ever was. I fear, tllat from the want of sufficient knowleclge of the c;enc.e -ofhastronomys I have not been able to describe t8e respecSg t2e ObsFvatory at Benares49diffierent-instrumentss and their uses, satisfictorily ;lloweveryou may rely on the measurements being taken with the gr ateg exattuess.

On the top of this the observatory was built, by the Rajah JEYSINGS for observing th-e starss and other heavenly bodies; it wasbegun in 1794, Sumbut, and, it is said, was finished in rtwo years.
