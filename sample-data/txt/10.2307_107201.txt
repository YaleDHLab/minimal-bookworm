XVII. Descriptiorl of the Mineral Bason in the Counties of Monmnouth, Glamorgan, Brecon, Carmarthen, and Pembroke,. By Mr. Edward Martin. Communicated by the Right Hon. C. F. Greville, F. R?. S. Read May 22, 18o6G. f1. HE irregular oval line, delineated on the annexed map (Plate XIV.) showvs nearly the inner edge of a limestone bason, in which all the strata of coal and iron ore (commonly called Iron Stone) 'in South Wales are deposited; the length of this bason is upwards of too miles, and the average breadth in the counties of Monmouth, Glamorgan, Carmarthen, and .part of Brecon, is from 28 to 20 miles, and in Pembrokeshire only from 3 to 5 miles. 2. On the north side of a line, that may be drawn in an east and west direction, ranging nearly through the middle of this bason, all the strata rise gradually northward and on tthe south side of this line they rise southward, till they come to the surface, except at the east end, which is in the vicinity -of Pontipool, where they rise eastward. 3. The-c-, depths front the surface to the various strata of .coal and iron orbe dveend uvpon their respective local situatio ns. 4. The deepest part of the bason is between Neath, in Glanorga ishire, and Li anelly, in Carmarthenshire; the uppers mnost stratum of-coal here does not extend a mile int a northMr. MARTIN'S Description of the Mineral Bason, &c. 3 and south direction, and not many miles in an east and west direction, and its utmost depth is not above 50 or 6o fathoms, A. The next stratum of coal, and those likewise beneath it, lie deeper and expand still longer and wider, and the lowest which are attended by parallel strata of iron ore, of which there are in some situations about 16 accompanied by irregular balls or lumps of iron ore, occupy the whole space between Llanmaddock Hill, near the entrance of Burry river, to Llanbidie, from the Mumbles to Cribbath, from Newton Down to Penderryn, from Castle Coch to Castle Morlais, and from Risca to Llangattock, and in length on the south side of the bason from Pontypool through Risca, Tinkwood, Llantrissent, Margam, Swansea Bay, and Cline Wood, to Llanmaddock Hill, and on the north side through Blaenafon, Ebbw, Sirhowy, Merthyr, Aberdare, Aberpergwm, Glyntowy, Llandibie, and the Great Mouna-in, to Pembrey Hill, near Llanelly in Carmarthensbire, and their depths are at the centre range of strata from 6 to 700 fathoms. 6. The strata of coal and iron ore running from Pembrey Hill, through Carmarthen Bay and Pembrokeshire to St. Bride's Bay, are only a continuation of those in the counties of Glamorgan and Carmarthen, which lie next to and parallel with the north side of the bason, all the remaining strata rising southward; and the middle ranges on the north side of the bason, are lost between where they meet the sea near Llanmaddock Hill and the south side of Pembrey Hill, in their course towards Pembrokeshire, in consequence of a contraction of the sides of the mineral bason, or rather by its becoming shallower; for in Pembrokeshire none of the strata of coal or iron ore lie above 8o or 0oo fathoms deep, consequently MDCCCVI. Y y Mr. MARTIN'S Description of the Mineral Bason all those which do not lie above 5 or 60o fathoms in Glamorganshire and Carmarthenshire have not reached this county, by reason of the bason not being of sufficient depth and width to hold them. 7. The strata of coal at the east end of the bason running from Pontypool to Blaenafon and Clydach, and on the north side from thence to Nanty Glo, Ebbw, BeaufurtSirhowy, Tredegar, Romney, Dowlais, Penderryn, Plymouth, Cyfarthfa, Abernant, Aberdare and Hurwain Furnaces and Iron Works, are of a cokeing quality, and from thence: the whole strata of coal to St. Bride's Bay alter in their quality, to what is called Stone Coal, (the large of which has hitherto been used for the purposes of drying malt and hops, and the small, which is called Culm, for burning of limestone); the several strata of coal from Pontypool, on the south side of the bason, through Risca, Llantrissent, Margam, and Cline Wood, to Burry River, Llanelly, and the south side of Pembrey Hill, are principally of a bituminous or binding quality. 8. Notwithstanding the principal strata of coal in Glamorganshire, lie from 5 fathoms to 6 or 700 fathoms deep, still it has not been necessary to pursue these strata deeper than about 8o fathoms. g. The veins of coal and iron ore, il the vicinity of most of the iron works in Monmouthshire and Glamorgan-shire are drained and worked by levels or horizontal drifts, which opportunity is given by the deep valleys which generally run in a north and south direction, intersecting the range of coal and iron ore, which run in an east and west direction, under the high mountains, and thereby serving as main drains, so that the collier or miner here gets at the treasures of the inthe Counties ofMonmoutmh, Glamorgan, &c. 345 earth, without going tothe expence and labour of sinking deep pits, and erecting powerful fire-engines. However, in process of time, in situations where the coal and iron ore that are above the level of these natural drains, become exhausted, it will-be found necessaryto sink shallow pits and erect fire-engines for the draining and workingiof the coal and iron ore, and at a future period pits of greater depths, must be sunk forthe samepurposes. io. There are ; 2 veins or strata of coal in this mineral depository, from g feet to 9 feet thick each; which together make 7o0 feet : and there are -1 more, from i8 inches to 8 feet, which make 24kfeet, making in all 95 feet; besides a number of smaller veins from 12 to 18 inphes, and from 6 to 12 inches 'in thickness, not calculated upon. i 1. By taking the average length and breadth of the fore-* going different strata of coal, the amount is about 1ooo square miles, containing 95 feet of coal in 23 distinct strata, which wvill produce in the common way of 'working 0oo0,oo tons per acre, or 64,,ooo~oool tons per square mile. i2. If thel whole extent of this mineral country w as an -even plain-, the' border or outbreakl of each stratum would appear regular and true; but owing to the interposition of hills and valleys, the edges of the strata, if nicely measured and planned, would seem indented and uneven yet in many instances the due range is totally thrown out of course, in consequence of knots, dikes, or faults. 13. These faults or -irregularities are not confined to the edges of the strata, but they take grand ranges, through the. interior of the bason, generally in a north and south direction, and often throw the whole of the strata, for hundreds of acres Y y 2 346 Mr. MARTIN'S Description of the 'Mineral Bason together, 40, 6o, 8o, or loo fathoms, up or down-, and still there is seldom any superficial appearance, that indicates a disjunction, for the largest faults frequently lie under even surfaces. 14. As every stratum rises regularly from its base to the surface, and is frequently visible and bare, in precipices and deep dingles, and often discovered where the earth or soil is shallow in trenching, or in forming high roads, and by reason of the whole -of the country within this boundary being so perforated by pits, and so intersected by the various operations of art and nature, :it is not probable that any vein of coal, iron ore, or other stratum remains undiscovered in this mineral bason. bt. Glamorganshire engrosses far the greatest portion of coal and iron ore, Monmouthshire the next in point of quantity, Carmarthenshire the next, Pembrokeshire the next, and Brecknockshire possesses the' least. 16. The strata of coal and iron ore in the last named county, which are the lowest in the bason, break out northward, and only take place in the three following distinct spots, viz. ist. From Turch River (which is the boundary between Lord CAWDOR and CHARLES MORGAN, Esq. ) across the river Tawe and the Drin Mountain to the great forest of Brecon. 2d. A corner of ground from Blaen Romney to the north of Brynoer. 3d. Another spot, from Rhyd Ebbw and Beaufort Iron Works, through Llwyn y Pwll, near Tavern Maed Sur, to where it joins Lord ABERGAVENNY'S mineral property. 17. Note. A principal fault is observable at Cribbath, where the beds or strata of the limestone stand erect: another, ARII SUGUAILP A DAUD .......g.. <K :ammtrSkakI cI. oes~ ~ ~~~~~~ZE~tJ'L C Xe.~~ORolhe -~~~ St~~f~l~yarde I s~V!,;o~per Ife ad fl bogy ha ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ om bRT flay n y flg'w~vA nC AS e k ' C CK At~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ CA E -R A 11?7' JV~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ fletm'wailhtA ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ a N * n1 thlt~ta044r4*ca~~~~~~y 1.~~~~' Caldy Womw -Hear -Pkilosx Tnw MD CCCVLP-et& 11V4A34t1 Aw ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~~~~~~ 4 ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~~----D/E owl, ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ 9 lilr 00kL ~ ~ ~ ~ 9 TH~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ZZZ I-. 9 4-~~~~~~OW 9~~~~~sm 2 Thilo Z,,,v -MID C C CVLZ ATT/&IX1I7. 34k. 2 r/2 t OC4mJ/ittOe Vdn42-Feetffendro VawrVemn~= 3or 4 Ymall Tezis of Coal 31?et tkie~ard~rernaf~rzn( hn here 4i-Jehwell lc Coal -h_a_ C__ 4 D)0 Cwr Canaid Coal, I 4-FeeO(C/-yderri& Coal -vartOO 1 < a j` 4FcOet/ (l, iay Vein/ ~---~ -"9100leet fOuomn Gle Biy J'ei~ r y~~~~~~~eet ~ ~ ~ ~ v Cws~~zr~olelirne.

The limestone appears to the surface all along the boundary line in the counties of Monmouth, Glamorgan, Carmarthen Brecon, and no doubt can be entertained of its due range from Newton across Swansea Bay to the Mumbles, and from Llanmaddock Hill across Carmarthen Bay to Tenby. In Pembrokeshire it appears to the surface on the south side of the bason, at Tenby, Ivy Towver, Cochelard, Bit Church, Williamston, Lawrinny, Cord, Canta, and Johnston; and on the north side of the bason, at Templeton, Picton, Harriston, and Persfield; yet it certainly forms an underground cons nection from point to point.
