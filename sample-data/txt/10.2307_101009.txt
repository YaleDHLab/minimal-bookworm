Extract of a Letter, Written by Mr. Muraltus of Zurich, to M. Haak, a Fellow of the R. Society, concerning the Icy and Chrystallin Mountains of Helvetia, call'd the Gletscher. English'd out of Latin by the Publisher, as follows; THe higest Jcy Mountains of Helvetia about Valesia and Augusta, in the Canton of Bern; about Taminium and Tavetsch of the Rhaetians, are alwayes seen cover'd with Snow (983) Snow. The Snow,melted by the heat of the Summer, other Snow being faln within a little while after, is hardned into Jce, which by little and little in a long tract of time depurating it self turns into a Stone,not yeilding in hardness and clearness to Chrystall. Such Stones closely Joyned and compacted together compose a whole Mountain, and that a very firm one; though in Summer-time the Country-people have observed it to brust-a sunder with great cracking, Thunder-like: which is also well known to Hunters to their great cost, forasmuch as such cracks and openings, being by the Winds covered with Snow, are the death of those, that pass over them. At the foot of these mountains are with great labour digg'd out Chrystals, which are found among other fossils, of two sorts and colors; some of them are darkish and troubled, which by some are call'd-the Chrystal-ore, to be plenteously found in the ascent of Mount Gotthard; others transparent, very pure and as clear as Venice-glass; sexangular, great and small: as in the mountains about Valesia, and the Town call'd Urselen at the foot of the Hill Schelenin they are digg'd out, and sold at a good rate. Of this latter kind my Parents, four years agoe, transmitted a very bigg and fair one to Milan for 80. pound sterling. This is, what I have observed about these Hills; What I shall farther learn of the people, inhabiting thereabout, to whom I have written a month since, I shall impart to you. In September 1668.
