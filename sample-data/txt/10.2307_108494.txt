[ 53 ] IV. Researches on the Geometrical Properties of Elliptic Integrayls. By the Rev. JAMES BOOTH, LL.D., F.R.S. Ssc. Received November 17, 1851,-Read January 22, 1852. SECTION XI.-On the Quadrature of the Logarithmic Ellipse and of the Logarithmic Hyperbola. LXXXIV. IN the former part of this paper, printed in the Philosophical Transactions for the year 1852, the author has shown that the geometrical types of those integrals, named by LEGENDRE and others elliptic functions, ate the curves of symmetrical intersection of surfaces of the second order. In the progress of those investigations he discovered two curves, which lie called the Logarithmic Ellipse and the Logarithmic Hyperbola. The properties of these curves have the same analogy to the paraboloid of revolution that spherical conics have to a sphere, or which ordinary conic sections bear to a plane. To determine the areas of those curves, or rather the portions of surface of the paraboloid bounded by theni, appeared to the author a problem not undeserving of investigation. Fig. 27. The logarithmic ellipse is defined as the curve of intersection of a paraboloid of revolution with an elliptic cylinder whose axis coincides with that of the paraboloid. The logarithmic hyperbola, in like manner, may be defined as the curve of intersection of a paraboloid of revolution with a cylinder whose base is an hyperbola, and whose axis coincides with that of the paraboloid. o Through the vertex Z of the paraboloid let two parabolas be drawn indefinitely near to each other, ZP, ZQ, and let two planes indefinitely near to each other at right angles to the axis OZ cut the parabolas in the points u, u', v, V'. The little trapezoid uvu'v' is the element of the surface, and if the normal un makes the angle e with the axis OZ, 4 being the elementary angle between the planes, uu=k tanpd4P, k being the semiparamneter of the generating parabola. 4 k~~~~~~~~~~~~~~*slin p~dlkd+ Now uv=ds=kC-S-3,.

Now when the area is 0, sec p= 1 and therefore constant = k-jd. Whence area= -jd(sec3p-1).(437.) This is the general expression for the surface of a paraboloid between two principal planes, and bounded by a curve. When this curve is the logarithmic ellipse, let the area be put (AH). We must now express 4 and po as functions of another variable 0.

Now, as we have shown in (16.), this expression denotes an arc of the spherical ellipse whose principal angles are given by the equations (464.), and whose radius is V/rz'kk,. Hence if a sphere be described whose radius is not r, but V/r2-kk1, tile length of the curve, the intersection of the sphere (r) with the paraboloid (kkj) will be equivalent to that of a spherical ellipse described on the sphere whose radius is Vr/2-kkj. When r=k, k being greater than ke, (459.) becomes ds wo-=2 v'k(k k) or s=2k(kk)O. Hence s is an arc of a circle. That such ought to be the case is manifest, for in this case the sphere intersects the paraboloid in its circular sections, and \/kkk is the cosine of the angle which the plane of the circular section of the paraboloid makes with its axis. We have shown in the first part of this paper that the curves of intersection of concentric surfaces of the second order may be rectified by elliptic integrals. When the intersecting surfaces are not concentric, the rectification of the curve of intersection may be reduced to the integration of an expression which may be called an hyperelliptic integral. The general expression for the length of an arc of this curve will be an integral of the form s= dxA/x + j YX3+ '2 + ax + a jv ax4+ 6~-ex2 + exw+ When the surfaces are symmetrically placed and have a common plane of contact, the above expression may be reduced to Xd + Fx2 +? X ax3 + bX2+ cx + ev This is also an hyperelliptic integral.60 DR. BOOTH ON THE GEOMETRICAL PROPERTIES OF ELLIPTIC INTEGRALS. When, moreover, the surfaces are concentric and symmetrically placed, the preceding expression may still further be simplified to +a~x P+ ?ax +bxc' which is the general form for elliptic integrals. We can perceive therefore that the solution of the general problem, to determine the length of the curve in which two surfaces of the second order may intersect, investigated under its most general form, far transcends the present powers of analysis. It is only when one of the surfaces becomes a plane, or when they are concentric and symmetrically placed, that the problem under these restricted conditions admits of a complete solution. We may. hence also surmise how vast are the discoveries which still remain to be explored in the wide regions of the integral calculus. We see how questions which arise from the investigation of problems based on the most elementary geometrical forms-surfaces of the second order-baffle the utmost powers of a refined analysis, with all the aids of modern improvement. It is not a little curious, that nearly all the branches of modern analysis, such as plane and spherical trigonometry, the doctrine of logarithms and exponentials, with the theory of elliptic integrals, may all be derived from the investigation of one geometrical problem,-To determine the length of an arc of the intersecting curve of two surfaces of the second order. .LXXXVJLL. In the logarithmic hyperconic sections, we may develope properties analogous to those found in the spherical and plane sections, if we substitute parabolic arcs for arcs of great circles in the one, and for right lines in the other. Here follow a few of those theorems. 1. From any point on a parabolic section of the paraboloid let two parabolas be drawn touching the logarithmic ellipse or the logarithmic hyperbola, the parabolic aics joining the points of contact will all pass through one point on the surface of the paraboloid. 2. If a hexagon, whose sides are parabolic arcs, be inscribed in a logarithmic ellipse or logarithmic hyperbola, the opposite parabolic arcs will meet two by two on a parabola. 3. If a hexagon, whose sides are parabolas, be circumscribed to a logarithmic ellipse, the parabolic arcs joining the opposite vertices will pass through a fixed point on the surface of the paraboloid. 4. If through the centre of a logarithmic ellipse or logarithmic hyperbola two parabolic arcs are drawn at right angles to each other, meeting the curve in two points, and parabolic arcs be drawn touching the curve in these points, they will meet on another logarithmic ellipse or logarithmic hyperbola. 5. If a circle, whose radius is a, be described on the surface of the paraboloid, and therefore touching the logarithmic ellipse or the logarithmic hyperbola at the extreaities of its major axis, and fiom the extremities of any diameter two parabolic arcs DR. BOOTH ON THE GEOSIETRICAL PROPERTIES OF ELLIPTIC INTEGRALS. 61 lbe drawn to any third point on the circle, if one of these parabolic arcs touches the logarithmic ellipse or the logarithmic hyperbola, the other will pass through a fixed point on the surface of the paraboloid. 6. If on the paraboloid we describe a circle whose radius is Vas?ba, and if from the extremities of any diameter of this circle we draw parabolic arcs touching the logarithmic ellipse or the logarithmic hyperbola, these tangent parabolic arcs will meet on the circle. These theorems will suffice. There would be little difficulty in extending the list. In fact nearly all the projective properties of right lines and conic sections on a plane may be transformed into analogous properties of great circles and spherical conic sections on the surface of a sphere, and of parabolic arcs and logarithmic sections on the surface of a paraboloid. SECTION XII.-On the Rectjfication of the Lemniscates. LXXXIX. There is a particular class of plane curves, of which the lemniscate of BERNOULLI is an example, to which the principles established in the foregoing pages may be applied with much elegance. Dlinition.-This entire class of curves may be defined by the following property. The square of the rectangle under the radii vectores drawn from the foci to any point on the curve is equal to a constant, plus or minus the square of the semidiameter multiplied by a constant quantity. Let Q, Q' be the foci, and 0 the centre, A, A, r Fig. 28. the lines drawn from these points to any point on the curve. Let OQ-OQ'=c, and letf be a variable constant. Then by the definition l e=efflr2. .(466.) But =(x+y +2cy2-2c'and +y2 hence (a2+y2)2=(+2c')xP+(P-2X )y2.(467.) This is the general equation of the curve, which assumes different forms, as we assign varying values tof and c. Some examples may be given. (a.) Let c=0, orf=0* I the equation is that of a circle. (b.) LetP>2c2, and makeP+2e =a2, f-2e=b2 .(468.) the equation will become (+y2)2=atx2+ by2. (469.) This is the equation of 'a curve which may be called the elliptic lemniscate. It is the locus, as is well known, of the intersection of central perpendiculars with tangents to an ellipse. 62 DRO. BOOTH ON THE GEOMETRICAL PROPERTIES OF ELLIPTIC INTEGRALS. (c.) Letf2=2c2. The equation becomes (x2+y2)2=4c2x2, or the equation is that of two equal circles in external contact. (d.) Letf2<2c2. The equation becomes (X2?+y2)2=(2c2+f2)X2(2c2f2)y2 ; and a2> b2. (e.) Let f2=0. The equation becomes (X2+y2)2=2c2(x2-_y2), or the equation is that of the lemniscate of BERNOULLI. (f.) Let f, passing through 0, be taken with a negative sign. The equation in this case becomes (x2?y2)2= (22)x2-(2c2+f2)y2 and b2> a2. In one case only does the equation of the lemniscate in its general form coincide with that of CASSINI'S ellipse; namely, whenf=0, and h=c, h2 being the product of the radii vectores from the foci. The definition of CASSINI's ellipse being " a curve such that the product of the radii vectores drawn from, two fixed points-the foci-to a third point on the curve, shall be constant and equal to h2," its equation will obviously be, 2c being the distance between the foci, h4C4= (X2+y2)2-2C2(x2-y2), when hc, (+,yi2)2=2c2(x2-y2). This is the equation of the lemniscate of BERNOULLI. These elliptic lemniscates may also be defined as the orthogonal projections of the curves of symmetrical intersection of a paraboloid of revolution with cones of the second degree, having their centres at the vertex of the paraboloid. Let a and v be the principal semiangles of one of the cones. Its equation is Cot2a.X2+ Cot2(3.y2=z2 2k 2/c Make tana =-, tank= -, and the equation of the cone becomes a2x2+ b2g 4k2z2. Let the equation of the paraboloid be X2+y2=2kz. Eliminating z, the equation of the projection of the curve of intersection will become (X2+y2)2 a2x2? 2y2. XC. When the section is an ellipse, the equation of this curve is, as in (469.), (x2+y2)2= a2X2+ 62y2*. (470.) This equation may be put in the form r2=a2 cos2N+b2 sin2k, r being the radius vector, and A the angle it makes with the axis.

On the plane ellipse as a base, let a vertical cylinder be erected, and from the centre of this ellipse let a sphere with a radius Va2+b2 be described.

BOOTH ON THE GEOMETRICAL PROPERTIES OF ELLIPTIC INTEGRALS. On comparing this equation with (474.) we shall see that they are precisely identical. Whence we infer that an arc of the elliptic lemniscate is equal to an arc of a spherical ellipse which is self-supplemental. It is very remarkable, that, whatever be the ratio of a to b the semiaxes of the plane ellipse or of the elliptic lemniscate, the arc is always equal to an arc of this particular species of spherical ellipse. There is another property of this spherical ellipse, that its area, together with twice the lateral surface of the cone, is equal to a hemisphere. See Theorv of Elliptic Integrals, &c., p. 21. XCJ.

An invariable relation exists between the parameter m and the modulus i; for as m= 4 and i2=a _+i2 =2 .(477.) hence i being given, m also is given; or the elliptic lemniscate can be represented by only one species of spherical ellipse, that in which the sum of the principal arcs is equal to two right angles.

When a=b, or when the lemniscate is that of BERNOULLI, we get the well-known expression a dC K MDCCCLIV ~ ~ ~~A/ 11 K;, 66 DR. BOOTH ON THE GEOMETRICAL PROPERTIES OF ELLIPTIC INTEGRALS. When a > b the integral is of the third order and circular form, but when a < b the integral is of the third order and logarithmic form. That it is of the logarithmic form may thus be shown. Let 2-2=m, and i2= ( 2+ Hence m-Zb a' +b) or i2 is greater than m; but we know that the form is logarithmic when the square of the modulus is greater than the parameter, when it is affected with a negative sign. This is a result truly remarkable. All analysts know the impossibility of transforming the circular form into the logarithmic, or vice versd, by any other than an imaginary transformation. The utmost efforts of the most accomplished analysts have been exhausted in the attempt; yet in this particular case their geometrical connection is very close. The modulus and the parameter are connected by the equation m . (481.) the upper sign to be taken in the circular form, the lower in the logarithmic. There are two distinct cases to be considered; when a is greater than b, and when a is less than b. Case I. a> b.

When a=b, the radius of the sphere is infinite, the sphere becomes a plane, so that it is not possible to express an arc of a spherical ellipse by the common lemniscate. Case II. Let b>a. In this case the arc of the hyperbolic lemniscate may be expressed by an arc of a logarithmic ellipse of a particular species, or one whose parameter and modulus are connected by the relation given in (481.).

When b-a, the above expression will become /20/I-2 Isin2 In this case the parameter of the paraboloid becomes infinite, and therefore the paraboloid a plane, just as the sphere became a plane in the last case; so that we cannot express integrals of the third order, whether circular or logarithmic, by an arc of a common lemniscate. XCIII. FAGNANI, the Italian geometer, first showed that the lemniscate of the equilateral hyperbola might be rectified by an elliptic integral of the first order whose I modulus is -y0 He did not however extend his researches to the investigation of the general problem of the lrectification of the lemniscates. Although the lemniscates may be rectified by elliptic integrals of the third order, as well circular as logarithmic, yet these curves cannot be accepted as general representatives of integrals of the third order, because in the functions which represent those curves, the parameters and the moduli are connected by an invariable relation, as in (477.) and (481.). Thus the elliptic lemniscate, whatever be the ratio of the axes of the generating plane ellipse, can be represented only by a particular species of spherical ellipse, that whose principal arcs are supplemental. DR. BOOTH ON THE GEOMETRICAL PROPERTIES OF ELLIPTIC INTEGRALS. 69 XCIV. The general fundamental expressions for the rectification of curve lines, whether of single or double flexion, show that the arc of a curve may in general be represented as the sum of two quantities, an integrated and a non-integrated part, or as the proposition may be more briefly put, an arc of a curve may be expressed as the sum of an integral and a residual. Thus the arc of a plane ellipse is equal to an integral and a residual, which latter is a right line. An arc of a parabola is the sum of an integral and a residual, which latter is also a right line. An arc of a spherical ellipse is the sum of an integral and a residual, the latter being an arc of a circle, while an arc of a logarithmic ellipse is made up of two portions, one a sum of integrals, the other-the residual-being an arc of a common parabola. It appears therefore to be an expenditure of skill in a wrong direction to devise curves whose arcs should differ from the corresponding arcs of hyperconic sections by the above-named residuals. Thus geometers have sought to discover plane curves whose arcs should be represented by elliptic integrals of the first order, without any residual quantity-the common lemniscate for example, when the modulus has a particular value. It is possible that such may be found. In the sane way, an exponential* curve ,may be devised whose arc shall be represented by the integral instead of taking it with the residual quantity k tanO secO, as the expression for an arc of a common parabola. Thus geometers have been led to look for the types of elliptic integrals among the higher orders of plane curves, overlooking the analogy which points to the intersection of surfaces of the second order as the natural geometrical types of those integrals. y * The equation of this exponential curve is ek cos( )=1. It is easily seen that when x=0, yO, also. Air And when x=_T, y=oo, Hence the curve passes through the origin and has asymptots parallel to the axis of y at the distance from the origin. 2 Fig. 29.
