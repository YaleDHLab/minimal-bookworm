[5] III. Further Observations upon Algol. By the same. Read January 15, 1784. OCT. 20th, PALITCH saw Algol nearly at its greatest obscuration, at 3 o'clock in the morning. Oct. 22d, near 12 P. M. he observed it again in the same state. Oct. 25th, at about 9 P. M. it appeared to him like a star of the third magnitude. He was prevented by clouds from making long observations; but as all those he has had opportunities to make, indicate a period somewhat longer than that of 2 days 20 h. 51~ he is inclined to think that half the difference between that period and his own, viz. 2 d. 20 h. 52~ will come very near the truth.
