C 86 J V. A second Appendix to the improved Solution of a Problem in physical Astronomy, inserted in the Philosophical Transactions for the rear 1798, containing some further Remarks, and improved Formul~e for computing the Coecients A and B; 'by z'hicb the arithmetical Work is considerably shortened and facilitated. By the Rev. John Hellins, B. D. F. R. S. and Vicar of Potter's Pury, in Northamptonshire. Read December 12, 1799. 1. IT was shewn, in Art. 9. of the first Appendix, that the common logarithm of the fraction ' + V( 1_c O) when c is exC pressed in numbers, might be taken out from TAYLOR'S excellent tables, and converted into an hyperbolic logarithm by means of table XXXVII. of DoDSON'S Calculator; which method of obtaining the H.-L. '?L/QtzmL is undoubtedly easier C ,and shorter than the more obvious one of first computing the numerical value of that fraction, and then taking out the hyperbolic logarithm corresponding to it from a table. But yet, that .method of obtaining the value of a, easy as it is, requires, first, a search in the table for the angle of which c is thie sine, and -generally a proportion for the fractional parts of a second; then, a division of the degrees, minutes, and -seconds contained 'in that angle, by 2,; and, thirdly, another search for the loga.' rithmic tangent of half the angle, and another proportion to find the fractional parts of a second. I was therefore desirous Mr. HELLINS'S Second Appendix, &c. 87 of finding some easier and shorter method of performing the whole business, without the use of any trigonometrical tables, in which time is required, not only in searching for logarithms, but also in making proportions for the fractional parts of a second ; and, after some consideration, I? discovered that which T an now to explain. This method, then-, together with so-me further observations which I have made for facilitating and abridging the work of computing the values of A and B, will make up the content of this Paper. 2.

These new forms to which the theorems are now brought, it is evident, are no less convenient, and on examination they will be found no less accurate, than the original ones ; and, that the common logarithm of A (and consequently the hyperbolic .C logarithm of it,) is much more easily and expeditiously obtained MDCCc N 9o AIr. HELLINS'S Second Appendix to the improved than the common logarithm of ( even with the use of TAYLOR'S excellent tables, is too obvious to need a description; and therefore it follows, that a computation by these new fornwulw will be easier and shorter than by those in the first Appendix. 6. But there are still' some expedients by which the compu-t tations of A, B, &c. may be further facilitated and abridged. It is pretty evident, to any one who contemplates the coefficients of the logarithmic terms in the first three theorems, that the terms a + -3-acc + 3-5 ac4, in the first theorem, being once found, the logarithmic terms of the second and third theorems may most easily be derived from them; in consequence of which, the greater part of the time of writing down the logarithms of -L + -, and Ido of twice writing down the logarithms of acc and ac4, and of searching in the tables for the numbers corresponding to 2X acc, and 41232ac4, in the second theorem, and for those which correspond to X-acc, and 2.96 ac4 in the third theorem, is saved. These are the expedients which I am next to explain. 7. The three terms a, a cc, and 3-5 ac4 which are found in 8.8 ' the first theorem, are evidently to the three terms caa C315, and ---' ac4, which are found in the second theorem, in the 4.12z32 ratio of 1 to 4, I to 36 and i to -7 respectively; or as 1 to 1-i. X to 1and i to 1-8; by which mixed numbers, the logarithmic terms in the second theorem may more easily be derived from those in the first theorem, than by the fractions, as will appear further on. Solution of a Problem in physical Astronomy. 91 S. It is no less evident, that the three logarithmic terms a, 3 acc, and ..3 5 ac4 mentioned in the preceding Art. are to the 8.8 ' three logarithmic terms 2 a, a cc, and a c4, which occur in the third theorem, in the ratio of i to 2, 1 to 4, and i to 65 respectively; oras itoi + i, ito i + 4,and i to i + ; by which mixed numbers, as was observed in the preceding Art. the logarithmic terms in the third theorem may be more easily derived from those in the first theorem, than by the fractions. 9. The first of the logarithmic terms in the first theorem has already been denoted by the Roiman letter a; now let the second and third, viz. -1acc, and 3 5 ac4 be denoted by the 8.8 Roman letters b1 and c respectively; and let the sum of these three terms, viz. a + 3 acc + 3a5 ac4, now denoted by a + b+ c, be put!S; then, by Art. 7. the logarithmic terms in the second theorem will be (1 -L) a, (1 .-. )b, and (I l c8) c; and the sum of these terms will be a + b + c-a b : a b c w-6 8 where S is given, it being the three ~. 6 _8'gvn beg logarithmic terms in the first theorem, with which the compu. tation ought to begin; and the n and 8 of these terms respectively, are very easily computed without the use of logarithms, as will hereafter appear by an example. And the logarithmic terms in the third theorem will likewise be denoted by 2 a, (1 + 34) b, and (1 +4) c respectively; the sumofwhichis a+b+c+a+ b+{c=S+a+? +k where S, as well as a, b, and c, being given, the fractional parts are very easily computed without the use of logarithms. 10 Having now described these short and easy methods of N292~ M. ULEL NS'S Secoid Appendix -o the improved "rtomputing the values of a, b, and c, and of deriving the other logarithmic terms from. them, and having introduced a new and more compendious notation of several of the terms in eaclh of the first three theorems, it will be proper next to exhibit those theorems in this 'improved state, and, after that, to give an example or two of computing by them. * 1 2 + e -fcc -gC4. i.

We might now proceed to an example of computing by these theorems ; but it will be very convenient first to set down the constant numbers and constant logarithms whichl are to be used in these computations. The constant numbers, taken fronm Art. 12of the first Appendix, and Art. 2, 3, and , of this Appendix, are the following: e=0-1931472, b = oo823,604, -p = 13862,944 f = o'1463,98, i = o1323,498, = o 1534,264, g = o 187,936, k = o0176,og,9, m. = 0*133a1774Solution of a Problem in physical Astronomy. 93 And the constant logarithms to be used in these calculations are the following, which are respectively set down to as many places of figures as are requisite.

As of the first Appendix it will appear, that the number of logarithms used in the new formuls is very considerably less than the number used in those from which they were derived; and still fewer will suffice, since the term 4 which occurs in the second theorem, is most easily derived from C the irst term in the first theorem, the logarithms of 2 and cc, being there ready calculated ; so that L. 43 needs not be used in the computation. 12. Let us now compute A and B by the first and third of these new formula, when Venus and the earth are the two planets. * See Art. J iX of the first Appendix.
