VIII. An Account of some Endeavours to ascertain a. Standard of Weigbt and Measure. By Sir George Shuckburgh Evelyn, 'Bart. F.R.S. and A.S. Read February 22, 1799., ?. 1. HAVING for some years turned my thoughts to the considera-. tion of an invariable and imperishable standard of weight andmeasure, as being a thing, in a philosophical view, highly desirable, and likely to, become extremely beneficial to the public. I had, so early as the year i78o, taken up the idea of an uni-versal measure, from whence all the rest might be derived, by means of a pendulum with a moveable centre of suspension, capable of such adjustments, as to be made to vibrate any number of times in a given interval; and, by comparison of the dfference of the vibrations with the diference of the lengths of the pendulum, (which difference alone might be the standard measure,) to determine its positive length, if that should be thought preferable, under any given circumstances; by which means, all the difficulties arising in determining the actual centre of motion and of oscillation, which have hitherto so much embarrassed these experiments, would be gotten over. (?2 .) I made several computations of the probable accuracy that might be expected from such an experiment, and was satisfied with their result. But, not seeing clearly how such a pendulum could be connected to a piece of mechanism, ta 13 Sir GEORGE SHUCKnBUnH EVELYN'S Endeavours number the vibrations without affecting them, I dropped the idea for that time. I learnt, however, some time afterwards, that Mr. JOHN WHIT9H-R4S:;, a very inious person had been in, pursuit of the same object with better success, and-had contrived a machine fully corresponding to his expectations -and my wishes. This he afterwards explained to the world, in a pamphlet, entitled, "An Attempt to obtain Measures of Length, "-&c. from the Mensuration of Time, or the true Len gth of "Pendulums;". published in 1787. Mr. WHITEHURST having therein done all that related to the standard measure of length, and suggested that of weight, it appeared to me tha it remained only to yerify and complete his experiments. (?. 3.) For this purpose, by the kind assistance of my friend Dr. G. FoRDYCE, who, at Mr. WHITEHURST's 'death, had Lur chased his apparatus, I was furnished with the very machine with which Mr. WHITEIUR^ST 'had made his observations. I also procured to be made, by Mr. TROUGHTON, a very excellent beam-compass or divided scale,--furnished with microscopes and micrometer, for the mostexact observations of.longitudinal mea. sure: as also a ,very nice beam or hydrostatic balance, sensible with the ri of a grain, when loaded with 61b. Troy at each end. Mr. ARNOLD made me one of his admirable time-keepers, in order to carry time from my sidereal regulator in my bservatory, with which it was adjusted, to the room wherein I had fixed Mr. WHITEHURST's pendulum; and who, having taken a journey from London into Warwickshire, was so good as to assist in the beginning of these experiments. Thus equipped, I went to work in the latter end of August, 1796, when the temperature was about 6o0, first to examine the length of the -pendulum; when, to my great mortification, I found that the to ascertain a Standard of Weight and Measure. Ithin wire, of which the rod consisted, was too weak to support the ball in a state of vibration; and that, after 15 or' 2 hours action, it repatedly broke. The same misfortune attended my trials with three othe different sorts of wires that I had obtained from London.. Whether this accident happened from any rust in the,, old wire, or from want of due temper in the new, or from its being too much pinched between the cheeks,* I cannot tell: I canD only observe, that all the wires that I used were considerably heavier,.and therefore probably stronger, than what Mr. W<IITEH URST mentio-ns, viz. grains in weight for8o inches in length; nay, mine proceeded as far as from -to 6 grains , for that length, and yetI could never get it to support the ball during the whole period of my experiment. This being the case,'and being in the country, far remove-d from the manufictory of this line: -wire, I was reluctantly compelled.to relinquish this part of the operation to some more favourable opportunity. Inthe mean while, however, I thought it desirable to measure the di'f ference of the lengths of Mr. WHITEHURST's pendulum -from his own observations; or, very fortunately, the marks that he had made on the brass vertical ru'ler of his. machine were still visible; and this interval, which he calls " 59,892 inches,"' I determined, on my dividedscale made by TROUGHTON, from Mkr. BIRD'S standard, to be = 9;,89358 inches, from a mean of four different trials in the temperature of 64; that meafrdiffer& ing from the extremes only =,ooo inch. (?. 4.) By this examination, if I have not verified, I have at least preserved, Mr. WHITE?URST'S standard; and,; for the present, I shall consider this measure of the difference of the length of the two pendulums, vibrating 42 and 84 times in a * CC, fig. i. of Plate II. in Mr. WHITEHURSTINS pamphlet. 136 Sir GEORGE SHUCKBURGH EVELYN'S Endeavours minute of mean time, as correct. On this presumption, I shall proceed to the examination of weight. (? .) From the opinion of different skilful, persons, with whom I have conferred, as well as from the result of my own considerations, I am inclined to believe there is hardly any body in nature, with which we are familiarly acquainted, that is of so simple and homogeneous aquality as pure distilled Water, or so fit for the purposes of this inquiry; and I have concluded, that if the weight of any quantity of Water, whose bulk: had been previously measured by the abovementioned scale, could be obtained, under a known pressure* and, temperature of the atmosphere,^ we should be in possession of a general standard of weight. (?. 6.) With this view, I directed Mr. TROUGHTON to make, in addition to the very sensible hydrostatic balance before men.tioned, a solid cube of brass, whose sides were 5 inches; and also a cylinder of the same metal, 4 inches in diameter, and 6 high. From St. Thomas's hospital, by the favour of Dr. FoR,. DYCE, I procured 3 gallons of distilled water. With these I made the following observations but, before I relate the experiments, I will describe the apparatus. Mr. WHITEHURST'S machine for measuring the pendulum has been sufficiently -explained in his pamphlet mentioned above; my divided scale, which was a new instrument, was as follows. v I do not here mean to infer any opinion respecting the compressibility of water; but only to say, that where water, or any thing else, is weighed in air, the density of that medium, as shewnwby the barometer and thermometer, must be known, in order to make allowances for it, if necessary. to ascertain a Standard of Weight and Measure. 1i7 (?. 7.) Descrioption of the Beam Compass, or divided Scale of equal Parts. a b, (Tab. V. fig. i.) is a block or beam of mahogany, 6 feet 3 incheslong, 6 inches deep, and , wide, upon which are laid two brass rulers, c d e, and fg, each divided into 60 inches, and tenths. The former of these, called the Scale, is, for a time, kept immoveable by the finger-screws c e d, and is furnished with very fine hair-line divisions, intended to be viewed only by the microscopes h, i: the latter, called the Beam, has no motion but by means of the screw g, and bears stronger divisions upon it, with which the sliding pieces or in-s dexes, at k and m, may readily be compared by the naked eye, and is intended only to set the microscopes, or rather the wires, in their focus, to the required distance nearly, viz, to within I O or L of an inch. The microscopes are compound, and similar to those described by the late Geheral Roy, in his account of his large theodolite. (See Phil. Trans. Vol. LXXX.) The one at h, contains only cross wires fixed in its focus; the other at i, has a micrometer also, by means of which its cross wires may be moved to the right or left, over the image of the divisions of the scale, any given space, not exceeding --I. inch; and the quantity so moved may be measured by the divisions on the screw head, passing under the index at v. The divisions on these rules have been called inches and tenths: it was not necessary that they should be more than eqsual parts; but they were in fact laid down by Mr. TROUGHTON, from a scale of the late excellent artist Mr. J. BIRD, who had divided into inches several scales of different lengths,; one of which, 42 inches long, belonged to the late General Roy; a second, of 5 feet, was purchased by ALEXANDER AUBERT, Esq. and a third, of MDCCXCvIII. T 138 Sir GEORGE SHUCKBUR GH EVELYN'S Endeavours go inches, which is now the property of the Royal Society, is kept in their archives, and is said to have been used by Mr. BIRD, in dividing his large mural quadrants.* -Besides these, he made two standards of three feet, by' order of the House of Commons,. of which I shall speak more hereafter. The mode of using this instrument is asfollows. (?. 8.) Let the object to be measured be supposed to be about six inches, and let it be desired to compare it with the interval between the 20th and the 26th division on the scale c d move by hand the microscope h, with its sliding plate, until the division of the index at k coincide with the division of 20 inches on the rulefg; then move by hand also the microscope i, with its sliding plate and appendage I m n o, until the index division near m coincide with 26 inches onfg: the axes of the micro" scopes, or centres of their cross wires, will be at the approximate distance of 6 inchles. T o correct this, examine if the wires of b correspond with a division on c d; if not, move the rule fg backward or forwvard, by the scrw g, till they do, then will the microscope h be adjusted. Now examine if the wires in a cover exactly a division; if they do so, the true interval of 6 inches between the microscopes is obtained; if not, move the microscope i a little, by means of the screw 1, till they do, and both the microscopes will 'be adjusted : then remove the rule c e d from' its place, by taking out the screws c e d, and place the object to be measured in its room, at the same time taking care that it be exactly in the focus of the object glass of the microscope, in such manner that one extremity may correspond with the wires in the microscope b; that done,. if theother extremity coincide with the wires in i, the dimension of the object is exactly 6 inches; if not, restore the coincidences * A farther account of these scales is given in the Appendix. to ascertain a Standard of Weight and M'easure. I , -by turning the micrometer screw n, and the divisions at o will give the difference, in 1oooths and io,oooths of an inch, + or 6 inches. (?. 9.) Description of the Hydrostatic Balance. a b c d, (Tab. VI.) is a box, which contains the whole apparatus when not in use, and when used serves as a foot to the hollow brass pillar efg h, which is fixed into it by the four screws at the bottom e and This pillar contains another within it, which is raised up and down about -t inch, by means of the screw x. n o is the beam, 27 inches long, and :,9 inches wide in its greatest diameter; each arm of which is made hollow and conical for strength glnd lightness: through the centre, at m, passes the axis of motion, the ends of which, when used, are suffered to fall gently upon two crystal planes, which are set horizontally by means of the spirit levels k, 1, and the screws underneath the box, at c and b. The ends-of this axis are of hardened steel, of a wedge-like shape, and reduced to a fine edge, viz. to an angle of about 40o, so as to move upon the planes with very little friction, and at the same time so hard as (with due care in using) to be in no danger of being blunted: to prevent which, the inner pillar has a motion upwards, as has been said, by the screw x, and, by means of a semicircular arm at its upper extremity, lifts the beam off its bearings, when it is not used, or is greatly loaded. This axis is placed carefully at right angles to the beam; and, by means of two small brass springs that press gently at the ends, is brought always to have the same bearing upon the crystal; so that no error need be feared from a small deviation from the rght-angular position of the axis to the beam, should any such T 2 140 Sir GEORGE SHUCKBURGH EVELYN s Endeavousrs exist; and, from its shape and quality it may be considered as inflexible in any ordinary experiments. Atp is a small adjusting screw, which raises or depresses a weight within, and with it, in consequence, the centre of gravity of the whole beam; by this means, the motion on its centre may be brought to almost any required degree of sensibility. Should the centre of gravity be raised above the centre of motion, the beam would turn over; if it be in that centre, the beam would stand any where indifferently, without any vibration; if it be placed much below it, the vibration would be too quick, and its sensibility not sufficient: it is therefore brought, by the screwp, a very small quantity below the centre of motion, so as to describe one vibration in -40 or 5oseconds; the sensibility is then fully sufficient. At each end of the beam are circular boxes, n and o, through which pass the steel centres, from whence are suspended the scale-pans q and r: these centres resemble, in some degree, those at m, but have their chamfered or angular edges upwards, and thereon hang the hooks P, to which are affixed the links o, and to them the three silken lines of the scale. Each of these centres has a motion in its respective box, by means of two small adjusting screws; that in o laterally, and that in n vertically; the former to make the two arms of the beam of an, equal length, the latter to bring the three points of suspension of the beam and scales into a right line. At the extremity of the boxes are fixed two needle points or indexes, which play against the ivory scale of divisions at s and t. These divisions although they do not, indeed they cannot, shew any definite weight, are nevertheless very useful in making the adjustments,, and even in weighing to the small fractions of a grain. u v are two steady plates, that are raised or depressed by the wooden nut to ascertain a Standard of Weight and Measure. 141 wz, to check the vibrations of the scales q and r, and bring them more speedily to an equilibrium. y z is a table, whereon the whole is placed, to raise it to a height convenient for experiments. To use with this beam, I had three sets of weights made, viz. The ist set or series of .1i weights, rising in a duplicate progression from 1 to 16384 grains, viz.

VII. fig. w.) is the brass cube of , inches that has been mentioned, suspended in its own scale, by means of four fine wires, from the arm o of the beam, Tab. VI. by taking away the common scale a r. The cube rests upon a cradle or cross, three arms of which are seen at g b i, and by this means may be weighed either in air or water, by immersion intothe large glass vessel g h, Tab. VII. fig. 3* At fig. 2. is seen the cylinder abvd and a bcd, four inches in diameter, and five high, slung in another cradle, part of which is seen at g b hi, supported by four wires from the pointyf In fig. 3. is seen a sphere of brass d, 6 inches in diameter, slung in a cradle a b c, by three wires* from the linksf, suspended in a glass jar,+ containing near four gallons -of water, whose temperature is shewn by a thermometer at e. These wires were of such a size that 9I inchesweighed 20,71 grains, cons sequently i'nch =o 2276 grain} and the three wires = o,68z8 grain; and their specific gravity being 8,7, their loss of weight, by sinking 1 inch in water, woul4 be 0,0785 grain. This correction it may be lnecessary hereafter to attend to. The glass jar is made somewhat conical, being in inchtes., Diameterat top 12,0 Ditto at bottom 8,7 Mean ditto _ 10,35 Mean height within I Contents in cubic inches _992,78 Which is iw ale gallons . = 3,8 = quarts. It may also be noted, that I inch in depth of the water near the top is 113 cubic inches, which is equal. to then exact bulk of the sphere, as will be seen hereafter. to ascertain a Standard of Weight and Measure. 143 (?. X1.) It was necessary to measure the exact size, and correctness of figure, of this sphere. For this purpose was made a woodengauge orframe abcde,(Tab.V. fig. 2.) in which the sphere was placed, upon semicircular pieces within, lined with green cloth to prevent bruising it: upon this frame was placed a brass -square k I m n, whose sides were about inch in length more than the diameter of the sphere. This square, by raising or lowering the screws o r s, was easily made to coincide with a plane passing through the centre of the sphere. p is a micrometer screw, the interior extremity of which is brought just to touch the surface of the sphere, while the opposite side bears gently against the interior side of the frame at o; and, by turns ing the sphere round, so as to present different diameters to these points of contact, any variety in the diameter may be seen by the index 1, and plate q, divided into io,oooths inch. To' render this operation more convenient three great circles were drawn with a pencil upon the sphere, at 90o distance from each other, (the twoformer were traced by the artist in the lathe, while the sphere was making, and the third was drawn front them,) and each was divided into 8 equal parts. The imm ediate result of these experiments would only give the diffe-' rences, and not the absolute quantity, of the diameter; for this purpose, a brass ruler r, fig. 3. was made, of such a length as just to go within the brass frame k I m n; and, being substituted in the place of the sphere, could easily be compared with any given diameter, and afterwards measured with the divided scale, fig. i. With these instruments I made the following observations', August-31, 1796, the thermometer being at 610. 144 Sir GEORGE SHUCKBURGH EVELYNS Endeavours (?. iz.) Examination of the Dimensions of the Brass Cube, by Means of the divided Scale. The microscope and micrometer being both adjusted, as well with respect to their focus,* as to the value of the micrometer scale, the cross wires in their focus were removed to a distance from each other of five inches nearly on the beam, (the former being at 27, and the latter at 32, inches,) and then correctly adjusted to this interval on the divided scale. I must observe, indeed, that the value of the micrometer scale was not exactly ten revolutions of the screw to -'-! inch, as Mr. TROUGHTON designed; but this measure by the screw,t from 6 trials, was deficient by -0,0002 inch; viz. two ten-thousandths of an inch were to be added to each tenth of an. inch measured by the micrometer, and so in proportion for a less quantity; but this correction is hardly worth notice.

See (I The Report of the Committee of the House of ( Commons in 1758, to inquire into the original Standards of Weights and Measure& "in this Kingdom, and to consider the Laws relating thereto." See also a second Report in 1759; both of which contain a vast deal of useful information on this subject, extending through fifty folio pages, and are to be found in the zd volume of Reports, from 1737 to 1767. A bill was brought -in, in consequence, but afterwards dropped; and it is much to be lamented, that this inquiry did not go to the full length of an act of parliament. Note farther, the largest of the beams, of which there are four of different sizes, now made use of in the dutchy court of Lancaster, for the actual sizing of the weights of the kingdom, is about 3 feet long, and is moveable with about 30 grains, when 561b. avoirdupois are in each scale, viz. about f part of the whole. to ascertain a Standard of Weight and leasure. 149 To which, add the weight of the common pan with the silk lines, on the left arm gan grains. of the beam, and marked with x, the == 413.,40 common right-hand pan having been removed J And the whole weight of the pan or ap-1 paratus for weighing the cube in air, Q = 968,4s becomes j (?. 17.)

It was necessary to ascertain the specific gravity of the brass wire, to make the correction mentioned in the note to ?. lo.; for, as it was highly probable, that in experiments with this hydrostatic balance, the scales for the cube and cylinder would occasionally be immersed to different depths in the water, and their weights would be altered, as more or less of the wires by which they were suspended remained out of the water; I accordingly found, that 8o inches in length of this1 grains wire, used in the scales for the cube and cylinder, >= 6,16 weighed in air J And consequently, 1 inch would be o,o77 grain, and four wires of i inch =,3o8 grain; which, divided by the specific gravity, viz. 7, would give oo354 grain, for the correction of to ascertain a Standard of Weight and Measure. i5; every inch that the scale was sunk lower in the water; and so in proportion.

It may proceed from two causes, which we will now inquire into. But first it may be observed, that the accuracy in measuring the dimensions of these two bodies, as well as the precision in weighing them, has, I think, been such as to put out of all doubt this part of the experiment. From whence then does this difference arise? Either of two causes may be suspected; viz. the pressure of the water against the sides of these two bodies altering their volumes, which, it may be presumed, would have a greater effect on the cube, from its figure,than on the cylinder, and in a direction agreeable to this difference; that is, it would diminish the capacity of the cube more than that of the cylinder, and thus make the apparent weight of a cubic inch less in the experiment of the cube. But also we see, that the cylinder was* The weight of a cubic inch of common or rain water has been reckoned about 253 grains, sometimes 253,33 grains, at others 253,18. But authors do not seem to have agreed in what they meant by common water, rain water, pump water, spring water, and distilledL water; for occasionally they are all confounded, and made to pass for each other; and sufficient notice. seems not to have been taken of the temperature to which these weights were assigned.

Now, if it be true that water is compressible, it wvill become denser, from its weight, at different depths, and this circumstance would act in the same way with -that just mentioned; viz. would make the apparent weight of a cubic inch less from the experiment of the cube than the cylinder, which we see is the fact. (9?. 2) In order to dissipate these doubts, I caused a very accurate hollow brass sphere to be made, of about six inches diameter, and of such thickness of metal, viz. 0,13 inch, as to be very little heavier than water, and yet of such strength as, together with its form, to resist any probable change of bulk by the pressure of water. This sphere, which has already been mentioned, (?. co.) was examined in the following manner. The six-inch moveable bar r, (Tab. V. fig. 3.) of the gauge, was compared with the divided scale of inches, fig. 1. The microscopes being adjusted to exactly six inches, or the interval between 26 inches and 32 inches, and the bar placed under them, the excess above 6 inches was found to be as follows, by the micrometer, n o. ist trial. zd. trial, after re-adjustment. inches. inches. 6+,oo5f 1 6+,oo00 1 ?053 | thermom. 0 I therm. ,oo56 j6~o,~0055 6oo ,0054 64j,0 Q0054 64oo ,0057 J ,0052 Mean of'the 1st trial= 6 ,oo0 o 6 ,oo536 Mean of the 2d trial = 6 ,oo,536 Mean of both, orl 6 t length of bar ,g=6 i-n"the temperature of 4.* See Mr. CkN T ON S Experiment in the Phil..

(?. 28.) The cube of this diameter, 6,00745 inches x 5236, as is well known, will give the contents of the sphere in cubic inches, viz. = 113,5194 inches, which must be very near the truth: for, if not, let it be supposed thatthe inaccuracy in the -measuremnent, or the irregularities in the figure of this sphere, to ascertain a Standard of Weight and Measure. 1Gi should be such as to amount to 5 inch, and these so many, .without balancing each other, as to produce a spheroidical form, one of whose diameters should exceed the other by l inch; in that case, the error -in the assumed solid would not exceed -3J otpart of the whole; and this is a position infinitely too extravagant to be admitted, when we recollect, that this diameter *has been probably taken to within a tenth part of that error.

And lastly, I hope it may be trusted, that the weight of a bulk of water a But, as will appear hereafter, (?. 41.) these weights are too light, when compared with the standard in the House of Commons, by about 1 in 1523,92; the correction therefore, for this difference, would be o,165 grain, to be deducted from 252,587 grains. I65 And the weight of a-ubic inch of distilled water, in grains of =252,42 2 the parliamentary standard, will be j t By means of an alteration and addition to my apparatus, since the experiment abovementioned was made, I have been able to repeat it at greater depths below the surface of the water, viz. when the centre of the sphere was 5 inches, 13 inches, and2 I inches, below, without any appearance of water having a sensible difference of density at different depths. The vessel I used for this purpose was of wood, 32 inches high, and 1 2 square, containing i6 gallons, with two sides of plate-glass, to admit the light; and the wires by which the sphere was suspended were 45 inches long, and stronger than before, viz. ico inches of the single wire weighed 24,14 grains; and due allowance was made for the different weight of the scale and wires, in. air and water, from actual experiment. to ascertain a Standard of Weight and Measure. 165 the sphere, has been determined to within of the whole, and probably to within half that quantity. (?. 32.) Having then, through the means of Mr. WrnTEHURST'S observations, and of his own instrument, ascertained the length of his proposed standard, in the latitude of London, I I3 feet above the level of the sea*, under a density of the atmosphere corresponding to go inches of the barometer, and 6o0 of the thermometer, which is full as satisfactory, for all practical purposes, as if it had been done in vacuot, which I conceive to be nearly impossible; and, having determined the weight of any given bulk of water, compared with this common measure; I believe it now only remains, to ascertain the proportion of this common measure and weight, to the commonly received mea' suros and weights of this kingdom. X(?. .) It is perfectly true, that if I chose to indulge in fanciful, speculation, I might neglect-these comparisons, as an unphilosophical condescension to modern convenience, or to ancient practice, and might adopt some more magnificent integer than the English pound orfathom; such as the diameter or circumjerence of the world, &c. &c. and, without much skill in the learned languages, and with little difficulty, I might ape the barbarisms of the present day. But in truth, with much incoilvenience, I see no possible good in changing the quantities, the divisions, or the names of things of such constant recurrence in common life; I should therefore humbly submit it to the good sense of the people of tbese kingdoms at least, to ' The height, as I have been informed, of the room of Mr. WHITFnv s r's obser-vatior s. t It is perfectly true, that -this supposes the experiment to be made with a pendtsu lum siitilar to Mr. WHITEFIUR&T S. i66 Sir GEORGE SHUCKBURGH EVELYN'S Endeavours preserve, withthe measures, the language of their forefathers.

By these means, no inconvenience would be produced from change of terms, or subdivisions of parts, or from sensible deviation from ancient practice: all that will be done, will be to render that certain and permanent, which has hitherto been fluctuating, or liable to fluctuation. To give effect and energy to these suggestions, is the province of another power. (?. ) The chief standards of longitudinal measure, as far as I can learn, that carry any authority with them, are those preserved in the Exchequer; in the House of Commons; at the to ascertain a Standard of Weight and Measure. 167 Royal Society; and in the Tower. The first alone, indeed, bear legal authority, and have been in use for more than 200 years; the last is considered as a copy of them, and is not used for sizing generally. The two remaining ones are of modern date; and, although they do not carry with them at present any statuteable authority, yet, from the high reputation and acknowledged care of the artists who made them, (the celebrated Mr. GEORGE GRAHAM, and Mr. JOHN BIRD,) are undoubtedly entitled to very great respect; and are probably derived from a mean result of the comparisons of the old and discordant ones in the Exchequer. I shall begin with that of Mr. GRAHAM, which contains also the length of the Tower standard laid down upon it; will proceed then to Mr. BIRD'S, and finally conclude with those at the Exchequer. (?. 36.) May i, 1797. I went to the apartments of the Royal Society, at Somerset House, and, with the ready assistance of Mr. GILPIN, at the kind instance of Sir JOSEPH BANKS, I made the following observations on Mr. GRAHAM'S * brass standard yard, made in 1:742. This scale is about 42 inches long, and half an inch wide, containing three parallel lines engraven thereon, on the exterior and ulterior of which are three divisions, expressing feet; with the letter E at the last division, and, by a memorandum preserved with it in the archives of the Society, is said to signify English measure, as taken from the standard in the Tower of London. That with the letter F denoting the length of the half of the French toise; put on here, by the authority and under the inspection of the Royal Academy of Sciences, then* This rod was not made by Mr. GRAHAM, but, at his instance, procured by him from Mr. JONATHAN Sisso N, a celebrated artist of that time. See Phil Trans. Vol. XLILI 168 Sir GEORGE SHUCKBURGH EVELYN's Endeavours subsisting at Paris, to whom it was sent in 1742, for the pur..-. pose of comparing the French and English measures. The middle line, marked EXCH. of the three abovementioned, denotes, as is supposed, the standard yard from the Exchequer. (?. 37) This bar of Mr. GRAHAM'S had been previously laid together with my scale divided by Mr. TROUGHTON, for' twenty-four hours, to acquire the same temperature; they were also of the same metal, and, by placing it under my microscopes, adjusted to the interval between io and 46 inches, I found the interval on the Tower standard exceed Inches. mine, by -Oooi27l ,00135 Il=-the total length therefore 36,00130 _O1 28 . inches, the thermometer at 60,8$.

Trans. for 1768, p. 324. As I am now upon the subject of foreign measure, it may not be quite out of place to say a word on the length of the ancient Roman foot, which I am enabled to dowith some precision. Some years ago, when I was in Italy, I had several opportunities of ascertaining the length of this measure, by actual examination of the Roman foot rules, of which I have met with nine, viz. two 'in the Capitol at Rome; one in the Vatican; five in the Museum at Portici, near Naples; and lastly, one in the British Museum, sent from Naples by Sir WI L LI AM HAMILTON. They were all of brass, except one half-foot, of ivory, with a joint in the middle, resembling our common box or ivory rules: and, by reference to my journal kept at that time, I find the mean result from all the nine rules, viz. by taking both the whole and the parts of each, (for they were divided into ia inches, and also into i6ths, or digits,) gave, for the length of the old Roman foot, in English inches, correspondent to Mr. BIRD'S measure, ii,6063. In confirmation also of this conclusion, and agreeably to the idea of Mons. DE LA CONDAM 1 NE, in the ( Journal of his Tour to Italy", I took theqdimensions of seve. ral ancient buildings, viz. the interior diameter of the temple of Vesta; the width of the arch of Severus; the door of the Pantheon; and the width of the base of the quadrilateral pyramid of Cestius, which, it is curious to observe, I found exactly ioo old Roman feet, and 125 feet high. This I do not remember to have seen noticed by any former traveller. The mean result of these experiments gave me I,617 English inches. Ditto, as before, from the rules i x,6o6 ditto. The mean of the two modes of determination is 1 1,61 2 ditto. I may add, that in the Capitol is a stone, of no very ancient date however, let into the wall, on which is engraven the length of several measures, from whence I took the following: The ancient Roman foot, = l ,63 5 English inches. The modern Roman palm, = 8,8z ditto. The ancient Greek foot, -12,09 ditto.MDCCXCVIII. Z 170 Sir GEORGE SHUCKBURGH EVELYN's Endeavours (?. -8.) From the information in the report of a committee of the House of Commons, that sat in the year 17,58, 1 learnt that Mr. BIRD'S parliamentary standard had been in the custody of some of its officers, but of whom nobody knew: however, under the authority of the speaker, who was so good as to furnish me with a room in his house, to make the comparisons in, I at last discovered this valuable original in the very safe keeping of ARTHUR BENSON, Esq. Clerk of the Journals and Papers, and which, I believe, had never seen the light for five-and-thirty years before. It is a brass rod or bar, about 3o inches long, and i inch square, inclosed in a mahogany frame, inscribed " Standard 1758"; at each extremity of it is Geo. 2d. a gold pin, of about -'0 inch in diameter, with a central point, and these points are distant = 36 inches. It bears, however, no divisions; but there was found with it, in another box, a scale divided into 36 inches, with brass cocks at the extremities, for the purpose of sizing or gauging other scales or rules by. Besides these, I found another standard, in size, and in all respects, similar to the last, inscribed 1760, having been made for another committee, that sat in that year; this also was accommpanied with a similar divided scale of 36 inches. These bars being too thick to be conveniently placed under the microscopes of my instrument, the interval of 36 standard inches was laid down on my scale with a beam-compass, two fine points made, and, compared with TROUGHTON'S divisions was 36,ooo23 inches; the thermometer being at 640. I then examined the other standard, marked " Standard, 1 76o" to ascertain a Standard of Weight and Measure. 171 and found it to agree exactly with that of 1758; at least it did not differ from it more than ,0002 inch*. (?. 9.) I was now to examine the old standards kept in the Exchequer: these Mr. CHARLES ELLIS, Deputy Chamberlain of the Tally Court at the receipt of the Exchequer, was so good as to supply me with; viz the standard yard of the 3oth of Eliz. 1i88, and also the standard ell of the same date. These are what have been constantly used, and are indeed the only ones now in use, for sizing measures of lengtht. They are made of brass, about o,6 inch square, and are very rudely divided indeed, into halves, quarters, eighths, and sixteenths; the lines being two or three hundredths of an inch broad, and not all of them drawn square, or at right angles to the sides of the bar, so that no accuracy could possibly be expected from such measures. However, the middle point of these transverse lines, between the sides of the bar, was taken as the intended original division; and these divisions, such as they were, were transferred, by a dividing knife, to the reverse side of my brass scale made by Mr. TROUGHTON, the thermometerbeing at 630; and, at my leisure afterwards, I found as follows. The ends of these venerable standards having been bruised a little, or rounded, in the course of so many years' usage, I conceived a tangent to be drawn to the most prominent part, which was about the centre or axis of the bar, and this point ' These quantities then being so small, I shall consider them as wholly insensible; and shall say, that Mr. BIRD'S parliamentary standards of 3 feet exactly correspond with Mr. TROUGIATON's scale. t There was also a standard yard of Henry VII, but of very rude, workmanship indeed; now quite laid by, and at what time last used, no information remainss: but of this more bereafter. Z2 172 Sir GEORGE SHUCKBURGii EVELYN S Endeavours being referred to TROUGHTON'S scale, between 6 and 42 inches, the entire yard of 1588, measuring from one extremity to the other, was found to be shorter than this, by ,007 inch: but these comparisons will be better exhibited in a table.

(?. 4o.) It appears then, from the above table, that the ancient standards of the realm differ very little from those that hbave been made by Mr. BIRD, or Mr. TROUGHTON, and c'onsequently, even in a finance view, (if one might look so far forward,) nothing need be apprehended, of loss in the customs, or excise duties, by the adoption of the latter. to ascertain a Standard of Weight and Measure. 173 (?. 41.) I shall now endeavour to shew the proportion of the weights that I have used, compared with the standards that were made by Mr. HARRIS, Assay Master of the Mint, under the orders* of the House of Commons, in the year 1758. They are kept in the same custody with Mr. BIRD'S scales of length, and appear to have been made with great care, as a mean result from a great number of comparisons of the old weights in the Exchequer, which have been detailed at length in that report. Mr. HARRIS having been of opinion that the Troy pound was the best integer to adopt, as the standard of weight, I venture to conclude that this was the -most accurate, and most to be depended upon, of all the various weights and duplicates that he made for the use of this committee; for he made them of I, 2, 4, 8, 16, lb. and of 4, 1, 2 3, 6 ounces. It will therefore be sufficient for my purpose, to compare the 1 and 2 pounds Troy, and their duplicates, with the weights of Mr. TROUGHTON. I did this, June 2d, 1797; the barometer being at 29,72 inches, and thermometer 67g. TROUGHTON 'S weights.

(?. 42.) In conclusion, it appears then that the difference, of the length of two pendulums, such as Mr. WHITEHURST used, vibrating 42 and 84 times in a minute of mean time, in the latitude of London, at 113 feet above the level of the sea, in the temperature of 6o0, and the barometer at So inches, is-=f9,89358 inches of the parliamentary standard; from whence all the measures of superficies and capacity are deducible. That, agreeably to the same scale of inches, a cubic inch of pire distilled water, when the barometer is 29,74 inches, and to ascertain a Standard of Weig'ht and Measure. 175 thermometer at 66', weighs 252,422 parliamentary grains; from whence all the other weights may be derived. As a summary of what has been done, I hope it may now be said, that we have attained these three objects; 1st. An invariable, and at all times communicable, measure of Mr. BIRD's scale of length, now preserved in the House of Commons; which is the same, or agrees within an insensible quantity, with the ancient standards of the realm. 2dly. A standard weight of the same character, with reference to Mr. HARRIs's Troy pound. Sdly. Besides the quality of their being invariable, (without detection,) and at all times communicable, these standards will have the additional property of introducing the least possible deviation from ancient practice, or inconvenience in modern use. (?. 43.) Before I close this Paper, after having said so much on the subject of weights and measures, it may not be improper to add a few words upon a topic that, although not immediately connected, has some affinity to it; I mean the subject of the prices of provisions, and of the necessaries of life, &c. at different periods of our history, and, in consequence, the depreciation* of money. Several authors have touched incidentally upon this question, and some few have written professedly upon it; but they do not appear to me to have drawn a distinct conclusion from their own documents. It would carry me infinitely too wide, to give a detail of all the facts I have collected; I shall therefore content myself with a general table of their * The various changes that have taken place, by authority, in different reigns, either in the weight or alloy of our coins, are allowed for in the subsequent table. 176 Sir GEORGE SHUCKBURGH EVELYN'S Endeavours results, deduced from taking a mean rate of the price of each article, at the particular periods, and afterwards combining these means, to obtain a general mean for the depreciation at that period; and lastly, by interpolation, reducing the whole into more regular periods, from the Conquest to the present time: and, however I may appear to descend below the dignity of philosophy, in such ceconomical researches, I trust I shall find favour with the historian, at least, and the antiquary, A Table exhibiting the Prices of various Necessaries of Life, together with that of Day L from the Conquest to the present Time, derived from respectable Authorities; with the added, the Mean Appreciation of Money, according to a Series of Intervals of So Years Periods, deduced by Interpolation.

(?. 44 Since the writing of the preceding Memoir, I have had an opportunity of examining three other scales, divided into inches, or equal parts, of considerable authority in this country, having been executed by the late Mr. J. BIRD. I have also compared the old standard in the Exchequer, of the time of Hen. VII. and which is considered to be the most ancient authority of this sort now subsisting: these observations, I flatter myself, the Royal Society will be desirous of possessing. (?. 4.) The firstd of the abovementioned scales belonged to the late General Roy, and was purchased by him at Mr. SHORT'S sale, the celebrated optician; it was used by him in his operations of measuring a base line on Hounslow Heath. (See Phil. Trans. Vol. LXXV.) It was originally the property of Mr. G. GRAHAM, has the name of JONATHAN SISSON engraven upon it, but is known to have been divided by Mr. BIRD, who then worked with old Mr. SISSON. It is 42 inches long, divided into tenths, with a vernier of loo at one end, and of Wo at the other, giving the subdivisions of tooths, and X ocoths of an inch. (4?. ij.) The second is in the possession of ALEXANDER AUBERT, Esq. and formerly belonged to Mr. HARRIS, of the Tower; contains 6o inches, divided into ioths, with a vernier, like that of the preceding. It is one inch broad, and o,2 thick. (?. 47.) The third was presented by ALEXANDER AUBERT, Esq. and the late Admiral CAMPBELL, Mr. BIRD's executors, to the Royal Society, in whose custody it now remains. It consists of a brass rod, 92,4 inches long, 0,57 inch broad, and MDCCXCVIII. A a 178 Sir GEORGE SHUCKBURGH EVELYN'S Endeavours 0,3 inch thick; bearing a scale of go inches, or equal parts, each subdivided into lo, with a vernier at the commencement, being a scale of lco divisions to iol tenths. This has been called Mr. BIRD'S own scale, viz. made for his own use; and was the instrument withwhich he is said to have laid off the divisions of his 8-feet mural quadrants. It is probable that Mr. BIRD made many more of these scales, now in the hands of private persons, (one of which, indeed, I saw at the President DE SARON'S, many years ago, at Paris,) but those have not come to my knowledge. (?. 48.) In comparing General Roy's (BIRD'S) scale with Mr. TROUGHTON'S, I found 42 inches of the former were 42,00010 inches on TRoUGHTON'S; (the thermometer 510,7;) 36 inches were consequently = 36,ooco8. And 12 inches on the ist foot were equal Inches. to the 12 inches from 12 to 24 on h-,0003=11,9997 TROUGHTON'S scale J The 2d foot + ,oooG 12,0006 The 3d foot _ -,0004 11,9996 The last foot + ,ooo6 12,0006 The mean foot, therefore, in General Roy's scale,) taken from four different feet, compared with I TROUGHTON'S, between the 12th and 24th inch, 12,00012 is as 12 to J That is, General Roy's scale is longest on 1 foot by so much, and longer on 3 feet by ,00036 And the greatest probable error from the inequality in the divisions is about ?,ooo And the mean probable error about ,0003 (?. 49.) Mr. AUBERT'S scale, compared with Mr. TROUGHTON'S, was as follows : 58 inches were equal to 57,9982 inches to ascertain a Standard of Weight and Measure. 179 on TROUGHTON'S; (thermometer at 510,O;) viz.

Mr. BIRD'S measure was shortest ,ooo88 Or shorter on 36 inches 00054 32 inches on the same were equal to 31,99967 viz. Mr. BIRD'S was shortest by ,00033 Or, on 36 inches, by ,o0037 The mean of these two comparisons is ,00045 And, by so much, is Mr. BIRD'S scale shorter, in three feet, than TROUGHTON'S.

Aa 2 1 8o Sir GEORGE SHUCKBURGH EVELYN 's Endeavours (?. si.) Lest, however, it should be suspected, that Mr. TROUGHTON'S scale, with which I have made these comparisons, is not sufficiently correct for this apparent preference, I will now give the result of my examination of that scale, fromone end to the other. I set the microscopes to an interval of nearly 6 inches correctly speaking, it was 6,6oo13 inches, taken from a mean of the whole scale; and, comparing this interval successively, I found as follows.

From whence it appears, that the greatest probable error, without a palpable mistake, in Mr. TROUGHTON'S divisions, is_ = 00033 inch; against which, the chance is 9 to 1; and It is not pretended, that in this and the foregoing observations, the quantity of any interval can be determined to the precision of the one hundred thousandth part of an inch; but it is presumed, that with the assistance of the microscopes, the ten thousandth part of an inch becomes visible; and, as a mean is taken from 5 or 4 times reading off the micrometer at each trial, it has been deemed not unreasonable to set down the quantities to five places of decimals. to ascertain a Standard of Weight and Measure. 18i the mean probable error ,oooi 6; and that it is 4 to 1 the error doth not exceed , inch. This accuracy is about three times as great as that of Mr. BIRD'S scales, and about equal to that of the divisions of my equatorial instrument, made by Mr. RAMSDEN, in 1791. See Phil. Trans. for 1793. (? 52.) I now proceed to the examination of the standard rod of Henry VII. which is an octangular brass bar, of about -1 an inch in diameter, with one of the sides rudely divided, into halves, thirds, quarters, eighths, and sixteenths; and the first foot into inches. Each end is sealed with a crowned old Eng-lish H, (u), and from hence is concluded to be of the time of King Henry VII. viz. about 149o, but is now become wholly obsolete, since the introduction of the standard of Queen Elizabeth; but such as it is, I have thought proper to examine it, and find as follows: Inches.

And the probable error, in the divisions of this old standard, is about _ inch. (?. Sj) It may now be desirable to see the comparative lengths of these various standards and scales, reduced to one and the same measure, viz. Mr. TROUGHTON'S.

From hence it appears, that the mean length of the standard yard, taken from the seven first instances in this table, agrees with the quantity assumed by Mr. BIRD, or Mr. TPAOUGHTON, to within I 0 inch, but that the latter is the longest.* These four quantities are taken from Mr. GRAHAM'S account, in the Phil.
