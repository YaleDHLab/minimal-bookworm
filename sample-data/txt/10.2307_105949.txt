[215] XXIV. An Observation of an Eclipse of the Sun at the Island of New-found-land, August 5, 1766, by Mr. James Cook, with the Longitude of the Place of Observation deduced from it: Communicated by J. Bevis, M. D. F. R. S. MR. Cook, a good mathematician, and very expert in his business, having been appointed by the Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty, to survey the sea coasts of New-found-land, Labradore, &c. took with him a very good apparatus of instruments, and among them a brass telescopic quadrant made by Mr. John Bird. Read April 30, 1767. Being, August 5, 1766, at one of the Burgeo Islands near Cape Ray, latitude 47~ 36~ 19~, the south-west extremity of New-found-land, and having carefully rectified his quadrant, he waited for the eclipse of the sun; just a minute after the beginning of which, he observed the zenith distance of the sun's upper limb 31~ 57~ 00~; and, allowing for refraction and his semidiameter, the true zenith distance of the sun's centre 32~ 13~ 30~, from whence he concluded the eclipse to have begun at oh 4~ 48~ apparent time, and by a like process to have ended at 3h 45~ 26~ apparent time. N. B. There [216] N.B. There were three several observers, with good telescopes, who all agreed as to the moments of beginning and ending. Mr. Cook having communicated his observation to me, I shewed it to Mr. George Witchell, who told me he had a very exact observation of the same eclipse, taken at Oxford by the Rev. Mr. Hornsby; and he would compute, from the comparison, the difference of longitude of the places of observation, making due allowance for the effect of parallax, and the earth's prolate spheroidal figure; and he has since given me the following result: 5h 23~ 59~ beginn. at Oxford. 7h 7~ 5~ end at Oxford. 0 46 48 beginn. at Borgeo Isles. 3 39 14 end at Borgeo Isles. 4 37 11 3 27 51 51 59 effect of parallax, &c. + 17 35 effect of parallax, &c. 3 45 22 diff. of meridians. 3 45 26 diff. of meridians.
