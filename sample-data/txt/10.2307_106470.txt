[417] XXVI. A new Method of finding the equal Roots of an Equation, by Division. By the Rev. John Hellins, Curate of Constantine, in Cornwall; communicated by Nevil Maskelyne, D. D. F. R. S. and Astronomer Royal. Read June 20, 1782. T H E following theorems are a production of juvenile years. They were invented about twelve years ago, when algebra was my favourite study; and one of them (the first) was published as a specimen of this method of extracting the equal roots of an equation about ten years ago. Since that time my avocations have left me but very little leisure for improving any invention of this kind. These theorems, then, are in their crude state; however, such as they are, I flatter myself, they will afford an easier solution of equations that have equal roots than is generally known, and be acceptable to the ingenious algebraist.

Call the three roots a, a, and b; then, by the composition of equations we shall have x3 2a x2 + aa x aab = 0, where b + 2ab VOL. LXXII. I i i 2a 418 Mr. HELLINS'S Method of finding the 2a + b = p, aa + 2ab = q, and aab = r; which values being written in our theorem, we have x (= pq 9r/2pp 6q) = 2aaa + 4aab + aab + 2abb 9aab/8aa + 8ab + 2bb 6aa 12ab = 2aaa 4aab + 2abb/2aa 4ab + 2bb = a. Q. E. D. E X A M P L E I. If the equation x3 + 5x2 32x + 36 = 0 has two equal roots, it is proposed to find them by the above theorem. Here p = 5, q = 32, and r = 36; these values being written in the theorem, we have 5 x 32 9 x 36/2 x 25 6 x 32 = 160 + 324/50 + 192 = 484/242 = 2, which being written for x, the equation becomes 8 + 20 64 + 36, which is evidently = 0; consequently 2 and 2 are roots of it. Otherwise, 2, the value of x given by the theorem, being written for it in the quadratic equation 3x2 + 10x 32 = 0, the result is 12 + 20 32 = 0. Or, dividing the given cubic by the quadratic x 2 ~ 2, we have x2 4x + 4) x3 + 5x2 32x + 36 (x + 9; therefore the three roots are 2, 2, and 9. E X A M P L E II. Given x3 + 10/7x2 4000/9261 = 0, an equation which has equal roots, to find them. Here q = 0, and the theorem gives 36000 x 49/200 x 9261 = 20/21, which value being written for x the equation vanishes. T H E O R E M equal Roots of an Equation by Division. 419 T H E O R E M II. If the biquadratic equation x4 px3 + qx2 rx + s = 0 has two equal roots, make A = 12r 2pq/3pp 8q, B = pr 16s/3pp 8q, C = 4B 2q/4A + 3p, and D = r/4A + 3p, and you will have x = D B/A C. A synthetical demonstration of this theorem would be very long: the INVESTIGATION is as follows. It has been demonstrated by the writers on algebra, that, if a biquadratic equation, as x4 px3 + qx2 rx + s = 0, has two equal roots, one of them may be had from the equation 4x3 3px2 + 2qx r = 0. Multiply this equation by x, and the original one by 4, and take the difference of the two, which will be px3 2qx2 + 3rx 4s = 0. Again, if this equation be multiplied by 4, and the other cubic by p, and their difference taken, we shall have 3pp 8q x x2 + 12r 2pq x x + pr 16s = 0, or x2 + 12r 2pq/3pp 8q x + pr 16s/3pp 8q = o, or x2 + Ax + B = 0, putting A and B for the known quantities in the second and third terms. Now multiply this equation by 4x, and take the first cubic from it, and we shall have 4A + 3p x x2 + 4B 2q x x + r = 0, which being divided by 4A + 3p, and C and D put equal to 4B 2q/4A + 3p and r/4A + 3p respectively, gives x2 + Cx + D = 0; and this equation being taken from the other quadratic, there remains A C x x + B D = 0; consequently x = D B/A C. Q. E. I. COROLLARY I. From the above investigation it appears, that one of the equal roots may also be obtained from either of these two quadratic equations, of which the first seems most eligible, I i i 2 as 420 Mr. HELLINS'S Method of finding the as the co-efficients of it are less complex than those of the other: 3pp 8q x x2 + 12r 2pq x x + pr 16s = 0, and 4A + 3p x x2 + 4B 2q x x + r = 0. And these, when p = 0, become 8qx2 + 12rx 16s = 0, and 48r/8qx2 + 64s/8q 2q x x + r = 0, or x2 3r/2qx + 2s/q = 0, and x2 + qq 4s/3rx q/6 = 0. COROL. 2. If both p and q vanish, then, from either of the quadratics we get x = 4s/3r, perfectly agreeing with the cubic px3 2qx2 + 3rx 4s = 0, which, when p and q vanish, becomes 3rx 4s = 0. And this equation is of use; because, in this case, the theorem fails, one of the divisors being = 0. COROL. 3. From the equation 4x3 3px2 + 2qx r = 0, which, when p and q vanish, becomes 4x3 r = 0, we also get x = 3 ~ r/4, another expression of the same value of x. COROL. 4. When r = 0, D = 0, and from the equation x2 + Cx + D = 0, we have x = C. E X A M P L E I. If the equation x4 * 9x2 + 4x + 12 = 0 has equal roots, it is proposed to find them. Here equal Roots of an Equation by Division. 421 Here p = 0, q = 9, r = 4, and s = 12; and A becomes = 12 x 4/8 x 9 = -2/3, B.. = 16 x 12/8 x 9 = 8/3, C.. = 4 x -8/3 + 18/4 x -2/3 = 11/4, D.. = 4/-8/3 = 3/2, and D B/A C = 3/2 + 8/3/-2/3 + 11/4 = 18 + 32/-8 + 33 = 50/25 = 2, which being written for x, the equation becomes 16 36 + 8 + 12 = 0; therefore 2 is one of the roots. The same value of x may be discovered from either of the quadratic equations mentioned in corollary 1. The proper values of the co-efficients being written in the first of them, it becomes x2 2/3 x 8/3 = 0, where one value of x is 1 + ~ 25/3 = 2. The other quadratic becomes x2 11/4 x + 3/2 = 0, one of whose roots is 11 + ~ 25/8 = 2. E X A M P L E II. It being known that the equation x4 x3 7x2 + 13x 6 = 0 has two equal roots, to find them. Here p = 1, q = 7, r = 13, and s = 6; and A = -142/59, B = 83/59, C = -1158/391, D = 767/391, D B = 12800/23009, A C = 12800/23069, and D B/A C = 12800/12800 = 1, one of the roots sought. The 422 Mr. HELLINS'S Method of finding the The same value of x may be found from either of the two general quadratic equations given in corollary 1. From the first of them we get one value of x = 71 ~144/59 = 1. And from the other, one value = 579 ~ ~, which is also = 1. E X A M P L E III. Given the equation x4 1/2 x + 3/16 = 0, in which two values of x are equal to each other, to find them. By corollary 2. we have x = 4 x 3/16 ~ 3 x 1/2 = 8/16 = 1/2. By corol. 3. x is = 3 ~ 1/8 = 1/2. T H E O R E M III. If the sursolid equation x5 px4 + qx3 rx2 + sx t = 0 has two roots equal to each other, and you make A = 15r 3pq/4pp 10q, B = 2pr 20s/4pp 10q, C = 25t ps/4pp 10q, D = 5B 3q/5A + 4p, E = 5C + 2r/5A + 4p, F = s/5A + 4p, G = B E/A D, H = F + C/A D, I = B H/A G, and K = C/A G, then shall one of the equal values of x be = H K/I G. The investigation of this theorem being altogether similar to that of the last, it is unnecessary to give it here. The difference of equations being taken as in the investigation of theorem II. it will appear, that one of the equal roots may also be had from any one of the following five equations, of which sometimes one, sometimes another, will be the most eligible. ~ 1. equal Roots of an Equation by Division. 423 1. 5x4 4px3 + 3qx2 2rx + s = 0. 2. px4 2qx3 + 3rx2 4sx + 5t = 0. 3. x3 + Ax2 + Bx + C = 0. 4. x3 + Dx2 + Ex F = 0. 5. x2 + Gx + H = 0. It is obvious, that, when p vanishes, the work will be considerably shortened; and when both p and q are wanting, though the above formula fails, yet the equal root may be easily obtained from the equation px4 2qx3 + 3rx2 4sx + st = 0, which in that case becomes 3rx2 4sx + 5t = 0. Whenever s is wanting, F, in the second cubic above, will be = 0, and consequently x may be found from the quadratic equation x2 + Dx + E = 0. But in any of these cases the equal root may be found by division. However, the operation probably will not, in general, be so short as extracting the root of the quadratic; I will therefore hasten to give an example or two of the use of the theorem. E X A M P L E I. Given x5 + x3 x2 + 0.09433 = 0, to find x, two values of it being equal to each other. Here p = 0, q = 1, r = 1, s = 0, t = 0.09433, and we get A = 1.5 F = 0 B = 0 G = 0.2231 C = + 0.2358 H = 0.1241 D = + 0.4 I = 0.0972 E = 0.4238 K = 0.185 and x = H K/I G = 0.48. The proper values of the co-efficients being written in the five equations before mentioned, and some of them divided by the 424 Mr. HELLINS'S Method of finding the the co-efficient of the highest power of x, we have these four equations, in each of which one value of x is one of the equal ones sought: x3 * + 0.6x 0.4 = 0. x3 1.5x2 * + 0.2358 = 0. x2 + 0.4x 0.4238 = 0. x2 0.2231x 0.1241 = 0. Now the most eligible equation is the quadratic x2 + 0.4x 0.4238 = 0, whose affirmative root is ~ 0.4638 0.2 = 0.4811, agreeing with the value of x found above, but true to two places lower in the decimal. E X A M P L E II. To find the two equal values of x in the equation 64x3 20x2 + 3 =0. The given equation being divided by 64, we have x3 0.3125x2 + 0.046875 = 0; and then, from the first of the five equations given above, we get 5x4 0.625x = 0, and x = 3~ 0.125 = 0.5. But from the second of the equations just mentioned, we have 0.9375x2 0.234375 = 0, or x2 = 0.234375/0.9375 = 0.25, and x = ~ 0.25 = 0.5. From the foregoing few pages it is evident, that rules may be made for finding the equal roots of equations of more than five dimensions by division; but the operations by them will, in most cases, be long and tedious. It is obvious, however, that such equations may be depressed to any dimension the algebraist pleases. It has indeed been supposed, that the number of equations that have equal roots is but small, and, consequently, that the chief equal Roots of an Equation by Division. 425 chief use of the rules for finding their roots is to get limits and approximations to the roots of equations in general. That use, it must be allowed, were it the only one, is sufficient to pay for investigating them. But if the equations that have equal roots should hereafter be found not so few as has been generally received, then the use of the above theorems will become more extensive. I beg leave to add, that this short essay is but a small part of a work, in which, if I should ever have leisure to put a finishing hand to it, something more on this subject may very probably appear. In the mean while, I hope, this little piece will be candidly received by those who have more leisure and better abilities for studies of this kind. Constantine, February 9, 1782. V O L. LXXII. K k k
