Some Observables about Load-stones, and Sea-Compasses. A Noble Person did upon a late occasion, affirm, That a Needle of a Sea-Compass, put in a good Iron Mine (which,he said, yeilded 23 pounds of Metal, out of a 120 pounds of Ore) was not sensibly moved thereby. Another Honourable Person desired, it might be observed, whether touched Needles move otherwise, when the Veins of Iron do not lie North and South, then when they do so? It being inquired by a Note from forreign parts, Whether the Sea-Compasses in England were brought to a greater perfection, than in other Countries? Answer was made by intelligent persons here, That all the perfection of our Sea-Compasses, as yet, consisted in this, That the Needles be touched by good Load-stones, and well librated, and that the Variation be truly placed: Though it was suggested withal, that for the greater perfection of such SeaCompasses, a way was contriving, to shew the Variation to Minutes and Seconds. It was also propos'd, That it might be inquired into, 1. Whether a Needle may be so toucht upon any Magnet, as not to point to the true North and South, to be tried in such places where there is no Variation known? 2. Whether (424) 2. Whether different Load-stones will give different Directions? And whether fainter or stronger touches upon one and the same Magnet, will cause any Variation in the Directions? For which purpose, as many Load-stones should be procured, as could be had, and a good number of Needles exactly made, of the same Metal, bigness, and figure?
