(459) (460) February'26, The same appeared yet to increase; as also February 27. But after this time I could not see it, by reason of the ill weather. The same Astronomer did subjoin the following Extract of a Letter he received from Monsieur Hevelius, March 15. 1667. concerning such another Star; viz. I have watched the New Star in the Neck of the Whale, as often as the weather would give me leave, which it hath done but seldom this Winter. In January, the 3, 4, 5, 7, and 13 dayes, it did not yet appear. From this time, the Sky was continually overcast,till January 23. on which day, I found a little Star of the Sixth or Seventh Magnitude, about the same place where the said New Star uses to appear. But it then seemed to me not the genuine New Star, but another, to wit, preceding the New; whose Longitude hath been defined by me in Mercurius in Sole visus in Aries. gr. 25. 43~.3~. and the Latitude gr. 14. 41~. 32~. South, Anno 1660. Then from January 23, to February 2, it was Cloudy weather again; but this second of February, it appear'd very bright, and that when the Moon shone, of the bigness of that in the Mouth of the Whale, or Nodo Lini: from which time I alwayes observed it to grow bigger. March 13. I did still find it extreamly bright, but could not by my naked Eye, because of the vivid Crepuscle, and the low site of the Star, accurately determine its Magnitude. I have received (saith he further) your two Monita ad Astronomos; and the Discourse hath much pleased me, you having not much deviated from the Truth, in respect of the Appearance. Heretofore I had of this, and other New Stars,another Hypothesis; but I cannot thereby so accurately divine the Appearances, as you will read more largely in its due place.
