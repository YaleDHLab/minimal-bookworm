At Derby (which differs from London in Longitude five Minutes) Mr. Flamstead observ'd the Beginning of the Entrance of the true Shadow, H. 5. and 19~. The Penumbra was seen in London to continue near half an Hour before it wholly quitted the Body of the Moon. There was also observ'd here, about the middle of the total Obscuration of the Moon, an Eclipse of a notable fixt Star, so as that the precise Time of its Immersion and Emersion was seen. Not doubting but that Mr. Hook himself will shortly make publick in a more ample manner these Observations, and divers considerable Particulars by him then taken notice of; we shall forbear to say any more of it in this Place.
