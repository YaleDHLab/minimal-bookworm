IX. A Letter concerning the success of the preceding Experiments. In a Letter to the Right Honourable Lord Charles Cavendish, V. P. R. S. from Mr. Josiah Colebrooke, F. R. S. My Lord, IN a paper (I lately had the honour to lay before the Royal Society, on the encaustic painting of the ancients) I mentioned an use which might be made of it to preserve drawings. I have now the pleasure of laying before your Lordship Read April 5. 1759. [54] ship and the Society a specimen of the encaustic upon paper, being a bird drawn by Mr. George Edwards, a fellow of this Society, on paper prepared with a ground of whitening and fish-glew, painted with water colours, and then the wax, &c. burned in. This will roll up as easily as common paper, without cracking the varnish. There are also two landschapes, painted by a young lady, after the same manner, on wood. These will fully evince all I advanced in that paper. I am, my Lord, with the greatest respect, Your Lordship's most humble Servant, Josiah Colebrooke. Budge-row, April 5, 1759.
