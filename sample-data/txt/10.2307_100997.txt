An Extract of a Letter Written by Dr. Edward Brown from Vienna in Austria March 3. 1669. concerning two Parhelia's or Mocksuns, lately seen in Hungary. I received the account of the Parhelia's, seen Ianuar. 30th last,st.n.about one of the clock in the afternoon, over the City of Cassovia in Hungary. It was communicated to me from a Learn'd Iesuit, call'd Father Michel, who lives at Presburg, but is now in this City. There were two Parhelias, one on each side of the true Sun, and they were so relplendent, that the naked Eye could not bear the brightness thereof. One of them (the lesset of the two) began to decay before the other, and then the other grew bigger, and continued well nigh two houres, projecting very long rays from itself. They were both on that part, which was towards the Sun, tinged with a pale yellow, the other parts being somewhat fuscous. There were at the same time seen several Rainbows, together with the Segment of a great white Circle, of a long duration, passing through the two Parhelia's and the Sun: and all this at a time, when the Air was almost free from Clouds, though here and there were scatter'd some very thinones.
