PHILOSOPHICAL .TRA NSA-CTIO NS. XXII. An account of experiments for determining the variation in the length of the pendulum vibrating seconds, at the princi-pal stations of the Trigonometrical Survey of Great Britain. By Capt. HENRY KATER, F. R. S. Read June s4, 1819. BEFORE I enter upon a detail of the operations which form the subject of this Paper, it may not perhaps be improper to give a brief statement of the occasion to which they owe their origin. The subject of weights and measures having for some time past been before the British Parliament, an Address was presented to His Royal Highness the Prince Regent, in pursuance of a resolution of the House of Commons of the i5th of March i8X6, to the following effect. "c Resolved, that an humble address be presented to His "Royal Highness the Prince Regent, that he will be graciously pleased to give directions for ascertaining the length of the pendulum vibrating seconds of time in the latitude of London as compared with the standard measure in the MDCCCXIX, Y y ~338 C'apt. KATER'S eperitnents for deter zining the variation "possession of this house, and for determining the variations in length of the said pendulum, at the principal stations of "the Trigonometrical Survey extended through Great Bri"tain; and also for comparing the said standard measures, "with the ten millionth part of the quadrant of the meridian, "now used as the basis of linear measure on (atpart of) the "continent of Europe."> In consequence of His Royal Highness's compliance with the prayer of this Address, an application was made by His Majesty's Ministers to the Right Honourable Sir JosEPH BANKS, requesting that the Royal Society would be pleased to afford all the assistance in their power for the accomplish.. ment of the objects therein mentioned; and a Committee was appointed for that purpose, of which I was named a member. The length of the pendulum vibrating seconds in the latitude of London, and that of the French metre having been determined, it remained to ascertain the length of the pendulum at the principal stations of the Trigonometrical Survey. This work the Royal Society did me the honour to request I w\ould undertake; and the ready compliance of Government with every requisition I made through Sir Josispu BANKS, for that assistance without which my success might have been doubtful, led me to devote with pleasure my time and labour to this highly interesting enquiry. the instruments with which I provided myself were, a transit by DOLLAND, of three feet and a half in length, constructed on the same principle as the transit at the Royal Observatory at Greenwich, so as admirably to combine lightness pvath strength. in the length of the pendulum vibrating seconds. {. j A repeating circle of one foot diameter by TROUGffOIN A clock and a box chronometer by ARNOLD, for the loan of which I was indebted to HENRY BRowNE, Esq. F. R. S. and An invariable pendulum with its support, a description of which will be given hereafter. To these was added, a chest of tools of various kinds. A small light waggon was constructed at the Royal Arsenal at Woolwich for the conveyance of these instruments, and a party consisting of a non-commissioned officer, two gunners, (one a carpenter), and two drivers with four horses of the Royal Artillery, was placed under my orders: a bell tent, and two others of a smaller description, were issued, which I found particularly useful. His Royal Highness the Commander in Chief was pleased to direct that I should receive such military assistance as might be necessary for the safety of the instruments at the different stations, and for the use of barracks, where I might find them suited to my experiments; and an application be. ing also made to the Admiralty for a vessel to convey me to the Shetland Islands, His Majesty's sloop of war the Chew rokee, commanded by Capt. T. SMITH, was ordered to re. ceive me at Leith, and to bring me back to Scotland. Thus liberally provided with all that could tend to facili. tate the success of my undertaking, I left London on the 24th June with Lieut. FRANKS of the Royal Navy, a gentleman whose fondness for science induced him to accompany me, and arrived at Leith on the evening of the e8th. Here on enquiry I found that the Cherokee had rnot been heard of for some time, but the Admiralty having ordered that any requisition I made should be complied with, 340 Capt. KATER'S experiments Jor determining the variation and His Majesty's sloop the Nimrod, commanded by Capt. DALLING, being in the harbour she was directed to prepare immediately for sea, and on the ist July, her provisions being completed, I embarked for Unst. Having put into Lerwick for two days, I availed mnyself of the opportunity to present a letter of introduction to Dr. EDMONDSTONE, and to obtain one from him to his brother TrioMAS EDMONDSTONE Esq. of Unst, to whose hospitality I was aware I must be indebted during my stay on that Island. On the 9th July we arrived at Unst, having been joined on the voyage by the Cherokee, bearing an order from the Admiral com manding at Leith to relieve the Nimrod. rTo both Capt. DALLING and Capt. SMITH I feel myself much indebted, not only for their judicious arrangements for the safety of the instruments, but also for the personal kindness and attention I experienced front them. At Unst, I was welcomed on the beach by Mr. EDMONDSTONE, who had received notice fromt his brother of my intended visit; and I immediately proceeded to examine the buildings which surrounded this gentleman's house, to select a place proper for my experiments. I at length chose the shell of an unfinished cottage nearly adjoining to the cowhouse in which the preceding summer M. BIOT had made his observations on the pendulum when he visited Shetland on the part of the Institute of France. One wall of this cottage, ivipwards of three feet thick, was ancient, though the rest of the building was modern, and it seemed to promise sufficient stability for my purpose. It is nowv necessary to give a description of the apparatus I employed. in the length of the pendulum vibrating, seconds. The pendulum was composed of a bar of plate brass 1,6 inches wide, and rather less than the eighth of an inch thick. These dimensions were chosen that the pendulum and the thermometer placed near; it, might be affected with equal readiness by any change of temperature. A flat circular weight nicely turned, and pierced in the direction of its dia, meter to receive the bar, wras slid upon it, and fastened with screws and rivets at such a distance from the knife edge which served as the point of suspension, and which will presently be described, as that the pendulum made two vibrations less than the pendulum of the clock, in eight or nine minutes. The inside of the weight having been previously tinned, it was exposed to a sufficient degree of heat to solder it to the bar. That part of the bar which vas below the weight, was reduced to the width of c,7 inch, and covered with black varnish in order to enable me the better to observe its coincidence with the pendulum of the clock, in the manner which has been fully described in -the Philosophical Transactions for i8i8, in, an " Account of Experiments on the length of the Pendulum vibrating seconds in the latitude of London,'" With the contents of this Paper I shall suppose a previous acquaintance, as an occasional reference to it will save m uch repetition. To the top of the bar, a strong cross piece of brass was firmly rivetted and soldered and a triangular hole having been made in the bar, a knife edge was passed through it, and a perfect contact between the back of the knife edge and the cross piece was insured by grinding them together. It was then secured in its place by tw o screws, the heads of 342 Capt.. KATER-S experiments for determining the variation which were sunk in the cross piece, and having been warmed, were dipped in pitch to prevent the possibility of their being loosened by the motion of the waggon. The knife edge was made of wootz, precisely in the same manner as described in the experiments on the length of the seconds pendulum, its ultimate angle being about 12os. The length of the bar from the knife edge to the extremity was about five feet, and it terminated in an obtuse angle, serving to indicate the -arc of vibration. The weight of the whole pendulum was ,5 lb. 9 oz. The perfect immobility of the point of suspension being of the utmost consequence, every precaution was taken by the arrangement of the form, and by the weight of the frame destined to carry the pendulum, to oppose the lateral force which might result from its vibrations. The frame was of cast iron; the horizontal part was 19 inches long, 17 wide, and half an inch thick. The back, three inches 'in width, at right angles to the length was pierced with three equidistant holes in the horizontal direction, to receive very large screws about five inches long, with coarse threads destined to attach the frame to pickets of wood driven into a wall. Two brackets were firmly screwed to the under part of the horizontal frame; these brackets were bevilled so as to spread at the bottom to the width of three feet, thereby opposing more effectually any disposition to lateral motion. In the lower extremities of the brackets, two holes were made for screws similar to those above mentioned. The weight of the frame was 87 lb. A bell -metal support, furnished with agate planes on which the knife edge of the pendulum was to rest, varied but little in the length of the pendulum vibrating seconds. 343 from that described in the Philosophical Transactions before referred to. It was contrived in such a manner as to be attached to the iron frame by three screws, and was levelled by placing thin sheets of lead between it and the frame, a method which was preferred fromn its promising a great degree of firmness. An arc divided into degrees and tenths for ascertaining the extent of the vibrations of the pendulum, was attached to a piece of wood which fitted into the opening of the door of the clock case. ?pansion of the pendulum. When the bar of the pendulum was prepared, previous to the wveight being soldered to it, its expansion was determined in the same manner as is described in the Philosophical Transactions before referred to. The results were as follow: Distance between the lines on the Bar 39,54 inches, Duff ofDiv.of xpansion in parts Highest Lowest . of Div. of ote length for Temp. Temp. Temp.

KATER'S experiments for determining the variation Operations at Unst. I have remarked, that I selected for my experiments at Unst, an unfinished cottage, one of the walls of which was three feet thick. This was composed of irregular masses of serpentine, which I feared might be loosened by driving in the pickets to which the iron frame was to be screwed. Happily, however, I found the pickets act as wedges, and secure the stones more firmly in their places. The pickets driven into the wall were of oak, and were upwards of three inches in diameter, and more than a foot in length. To these the iron frame was firmly attached by its five screws, and on the evening of the loth of July, I had the satisfaction of find.s ing it as securely fixed as I could possibly desire. Two pieces of deal plank two inches and a half thick were next fastened by long nails to the wall. To these the clock case was screwed at such a distance beneath the iron frame, as that the end of the brass pendulum might reach a little below the centre of the pendulum of the clock, and the clock Was then put in beat, by moving the bottom of the case to -the right or left, and when properly adjusted, the screws were tightened. The bell metal support was next put in its place and carefully levelled and the pendulum lodged in the Ys elevated for that purpose. The triangular stand carrying the telescope, described in the paper on the seconds pendulum before referred to, was firmly screwed to pickets driven into the ground at about eight feet and a half in front of the clock ; and the Ys which supported the pendulum being lowered till the knife edge rested on the agate planes, the diaphragm of the telescope was i~n the length of the pendulum vioati'ng secondly . 45, adjusted so as for its edges to coincide exactly with those of the extremity of the pendulum. The next step was to bing in a right line, the telescope, the extremity of the pendluFm and a white circle of the, same diameter pasted on a black ground on the centre of the pendulum of the clock. For this purpose both pendulums being at rest, the telescope was slid laterally on its supports until a small particle of the disk was seen, and a mark was made on the support of the telescope with a pencil. The telescope was now slid in the opposite direction till an equal portion of the disk became vsible, when another mark was made, and the telescope being placed so as to bisect these two marks, the centre of the object glass would evidently be in the prolongation of a line joining the white disk and the extremity of the pendulum. The diaphragm was next brought by the circular horizontal movement of the telescope to correspond with the edges of the pendulum, and the divided arc for indicating the extent of the vibrations was placed so that its zero coincided with the extremity of the pendulum. The same thermometer which was used in my former ex. penments and for the loan of which I was indebted to the kindness of Dr. WOLLASTON, was suspended on the clock case near the middle of the pendulum and every thing being thus arranged, the pendulum of the clock was put in motion, and the knife edge elevated by means of the Ys above the agate planes, to prevent any injury when not in use. A firm support for the transit instrument became the next object of attention, and foe this purpose I tried a box nearly * The wooden support was placed s as for the telescope to be within tie limits of the sliding adjustment. MD)CCXIx. Z z 2346 C~apt. KATER'S experiments for deterining the variation filled: with sand, upon which a flat stone was laid. But as this did not prove so steady as I expected, a larger stone was afterwards procured and laid upon the box, and upon this thetransit was placed. The bell tent before mentioned was suspended over the transit from three spars lashed, together at the top, The interval-of time between the transits of the samestar being all that is required for the present purpose, it is not necessary that the transit instrutnent should be accurately in the meridian; it issufficient that it should always describe the same vertical circle; it was however brought very near the meridian, at all the stations, by the following method: The error of the chronometer was determined by altitudes of the sun, andthe times were computed when the first and last limb would be on the meridian. The axis of the transit was carefully levelled, and a little before the time of the sun's first limb coming to the meridian, the middle wire of %the transit was brought in contact with it, and kept so by the horizontal adjustment' till the calculated time of its arrival on the meridian. The position of the instrument was afterwards farther corrected if necessary by the: transit of -the secondlimb. At other of the stations when the weather permitted, the instrument was brought extremely near the meridian by the transit of the pole star, the telescope being sufficiently powerful to command this star with ease, at any time of the day. A mark (generally a flat board sharpened! at one end to 'renetrate the ground) was sent to as great adistance as con;enient, and so placed by signal, that it was bisected bythe middle wire of the transit ; and to this the instrument was n the length of the pendulum vibrating seconds. 3 V carefully adjusted previously to every observation-, The pres ceding detail may serve, with very little difference, for each. of the stations, and I have been thus minute 'in my description of the various adjustments necessary, in order that no difficulty may be experienced by any who may use the pendulum after me. In observing the time of the transits, the chronometer was used, and was -found to be particularly convenient from its beating half seconds. As soon as possible after the passage of the star, the chronometer was carefully compared witlh the clock, and the difference being applied to the time of the transit shown by the chronometer, and also the computed gain or loss of the clock during the interval between the observation and the comparison; the time shown by the clock at the instant of the transit was obtained. These comparisons, as well as the whole of the data necessary for the examination of the results given in this paper, will be found in the Appendix. The climate of Unst, at the season when I visited it, is such as to render the opportunities for celestial observations extremely rare. I had been informed, that the months of July and August were the most favourable, but on the contrary, I learnt on my arrival that they were considered the least so of any of the year, the atmosphere being generally clearest in May and September. Dense fogs anrd light rains succeeded each other, rarely permitting a sight of the sun; and it was not until the 22d of July, that I was able first to observe the transits of a few stars. Trhe following table contains the observations for the rate of the clock at Unst, derived from the table of transits given in the Appendix. 348 wCqt.

To this, which is the rate of the clock in a sidereal day, the gain of the clock (os,14) in four minutes was added, to obtain the rate for a mean solar day. Rate of the clock at UNST. (Gaining.)

For any other interval and rate, the mean of the vibrations during such interval is taken, and the difference, betvween the corresponding rate and ,os,63 is added to, or subtracted from such irean number of vibrations accordingly as the rate of the clock has increased or diminished. 'I he same method is pursued in all the subsequent experiments. In this manner the results contained in the next following table under the head of " computed vibrations in a mean solar day" were obtained. 35o Capt. KATER'S experimentsfor determining the variation The invariable pendulum furnishes a means of severely checking the rate of the clock; for should any alteration occur, it immediately indicates it. Thus on referring to the preceding table of ", vibrations of the pendulu-n at 62'," it appears that from the 23d to the 28th of July, a gradual increase in the rate of the clock had taken place, amounting in the whole to a quantity equal to 2,5 vibrations of the pendulum, or 0,5 of a vibration in every 24 hours. The rate of the clock, is that due to the middle time -of the interval between the transits from which it is deduced. The number of vibrations of the pendulum is obtained for the mean of the times at which the coincidences were observed. If this mean should not coincide with the time for which the rate of the clock is obtained, and the rate of the clock should be variable, the number of vibrations of the pendulum computed on such given rate must evidently be erroneous. If the mean of the interval of the transits should be before the mean of the times of the coincidences the number of vibra.. tions will, in the present case of an accelerating rate, be in defect. If after the mean of the coincidences, they will be in excess; and the proportionate change of rate must be added or subtracted accordingly. On this principle the corrections were calculated and the results obtained, which are contained in the following table. in the length of the pendulum vibrating seconds. ag By the Stars. UN ST.

I +,12 86091,02 2 2 We have now to consider what authority attaches to each result, so that we may employ all the observations in obtaining a mean, and yet give to each set that degree of weight only to which it is entitled. The accuracy of any one result will evidently in the first place depend on the number of stars observed from which the rate of the clock is deduced; and on this head as may be seen by examining the table of transits, there is little probability of serious error. But the position of the transit intrument with respect to the meridian rumark, requires the most minute care, and I soon discovered that to this, and to the accurate levelling of the axis, it was necessary to pay unceasing attention, as a deviation equal to the diameter of the silkwormn's thread in the focus of the eye glass, would occasion an error in the time of the transit of a stararmiounting to about three tenths of a second. 352H Capt. KATER'S experiments for determining the variation The effect of this error on the daily rate of the clock, is lessened in proportion to the number of days comprised between the two transits; for if the rate of the clock be deduced from transits observed on two successive days, the whole amount of the error arising from any deviation of the instrument from the meridian mark, will be included in the rate; but for any longer interval, it is divided by the number of days constituting such interval. In order therefore to obtain a true mean., it appears that each result should be multiplied by the product of the number of the stars into the interval between the observations, and the sum of such final products be divided by the sumn of the factors. Observations of the sun are perhaps less entitled to credit than those of the stars, as in consequence of an apparent wavering of the meridian mark, some degree of uncertainty frequently exists in adjusting the transit instrument; setting this aside, a transit of both limbs of the sun may be considered equal to the transits of two stars. Proceeding in the computation in the manner just described, we obtain 86o90,77 vibrations of the pendulum in 24 hours, by the observations of the stars, and 86o9o,79 by those of the sun. But from what has been said, these results are entitled to credit in the ratio of the sums of their factors.that is, as 5o to i6 9 the final mean is therefore 860o90,77 vibrations in a mean solar day. The force of gravity decreasing as the square of the dis. tance from the earthis centre increases, the next step is to find the correction on this supposition for the height of the m ftat;on above the tlevel of the sea. As the square of the in the length of the pendulum vibrating seconds. 8 number of vibrations of the pendulum represents the force of gravity, we have this simple rule: convert the height of the station into the decimal of a mile, and divide it by the radius of the earth (3954,583) the quotient is the factor by which the number of vibrations in 24 houlrs being multiplied, the product will be the correction required. But the quantity thus obtained is evidently erroneous, being founded on the supposition that the experiments are made on an elevation having no attractive matter surrounding it; and it is observed by Dr. YOUNG, in a letter which that eminent mathematician addressed to me, and which is published in the Phil, Tratns. for i819, entitled " Remarks on the probabilities o Of error in physical observations, and on the density of the earth considered especially with regard to the reduction "of experiments on the pendulum ;" that "' if we were raised on a sphere of earth a ilile in diameter, its attraction would be about O of that of the whole globe, and instead of a reduction of 2 0X00 in the force of gravity, we should obtain "only830 or 4 as much. Nor -is it at all probable, that the attraction of any hill, a mile in height, would be so little "as this even supposing its density to be only two thirds of "the mean density of the earth. That of a hemispherical hill of the same height would be more than half as much " more (than the sphere) or in the proportion of i,586 to i. "And it maybe easily shown, that the attraction of a large "tract of table land, considered as an extensive flat surface a "c mile in thickness, would be three times as great as that of a sphere a mile in diameter; or about twice as great as that of such a sphere of the mean density of the earth: so that, for a place so situated, the allowance for elevation would "4c be reduced to one half: and in almost any country that could MDCCCXIX. $ A S54, Capt. KATER'S experiments for determining the variation "be chosen for the experiment, it must remain less than three "fourths of the whole correction deduced immediately from the duplicate proportion of the distances from the earth's centre." By this interesting, and I believe new view which Dr. YOUNG has taken of the subject, it appears that the correction for the elevation above the sea, will vary (according to the nature of the eminence and also its density) from one half to three fourths of the quantity before deduced from the squares of the distances from the earth's centre, and if the mean density of the earth be taken at 5,5, and that of the matter surrounding the station at 2,5, Dr. YOUNG is of opinion, that the quantity deduced from the duplicate ratio of the distances should be multiplied by , to obtain the correction for a table land, and by -l7 for that of an eminence of moderate declivity. By careful levelling, the height of the station at Unst above low water, was found to be 28 feet; whence we have o,12 four the correction deduced from the squares of the distances from the earth's centre, and as the station at Unst was surrounded by hills composed of serpentine I shall take o0,2 x I _ oo6 for the correction to be applied in order to obtain the number of vibrations which would be made at the level of the -sea. The last correction to be found, is for the buoyancy of the atmosphere. The manner in which this correction is derived, has been fully explained in the "s Account of experiments for "determining the length of the seconds pendulum" before referred to. The specific gravities of the weight and bar of the pendulum, were carefully determined. That of the bar was found to be 8,628, and of the weight 8,603. The specific in the length of the pendulum vibrating seconds. 2 gravity therefore of the whole pendulum may be taken at 8,61o, The mean height of the barometer during the experiments at Llnst, was 29,98 inches, andz that of the thermometer 57,08. The weight of water is to that of air at 29,27 inches of the barometer, and Ago of the thermometer, as 836 to 1, and the expansion of air for each degree of the thermometer is i of its bulk. From these data we find that the specific gravity of the pendulum was to that of air, at the time of the experiments, as 7099 to i. The square of the number of vibrations must therefore be increased part, or 6,07 be added to the number of vibrations in 24 hours, to obtain the number of vibrations which would be made during the same period in vacuo. These corrections being added to the mean number of vibrations before given, we have 86096,90 for the number of vibrations made by the pendulum in a mean solar day, in vacuo at the level of the sea, The very unfavourable weather which I experienced at Unst, prevented my obtainling so many observations for the rate of the clock, as I could have wished; but though the greatest difference between the seven resulting numbers of vibrations amounts to so much as o,449, I think it probable, after 'a careful examination, that the final result must be within one tenth of a vibration of the truth. On the 23d July, I was so fortunate as to obtain one series of meridional observations of the sun, with the repeating circle, for the latitude of the station) which. will be given hereafter, and on the 29th I embarked on board the Cherokee, and -took leave of my kind host Mr. EDMONDSTONa, to whose Most friendly hospitality the eloquent pen of M., BIOT has 856 Capt. KATER'S experiments for determining the variatzopI done but justice, and has left me nothing to add, but that I experienced from him every attention that could contribute to my personal comfort, and every anxious exertion that could tend to forward the enquiry in which I was engaged. Operations at Portsoy. On the first of August I arrived at Portsoy, near to which is Cowhythe, the next station of the trigonometrical survey, which I proposed to connect with my observations, and after mnuch search for a place suited to my experiments, was kindly favoured by the Rev. Mr. GRANT, With the use of his schoolhouse, which was perfectly adapted to the purpose, the walls being thick, and firmly built of serpentine. I was also so fortunate as to obtain accommodations for myself, at a house belonging to a gentleman of the name of WATSON, immediatelv adjoining the school-house, and whose garden afforded an excellent situation for the transit instrument. On the 5th August I commenced the observations detailed in the Appendix, from which is extracted the following table for obtaining the rate of the clock: Transits observed at PORTSOY. ist Series.

The height of the pendulum at Portsoy, above low water. was found -by levelling to be 94 feet, the correction due to which is 0,39 x = 0,23. * It may be necessary to remark, that no allowance has been attempted for ary variation of density between the different stations, but solely for their forms 360x rapt;. KATEP's experiments for deierminzng the variatlo The mean height of the barometer during the experiments, was 0o,og inches, and the mean temperature 60?,8, from which data, and the specific gravity of the pendulum, we have 6,o4 for the correction, on account of the buoyancy of the atmosphere. Applying these corrections to the mean number of vibras tiPns before found, we obtain 86o86,o i for the final number of vibrations which would be made by the pendulum in a mean solar day, in vacuo, and at the level of the sea. The rate of the clock having suffered a continual acceleration, as I have before stated, it became a subject of anxious importance to determine what effect this might possibly have oon the result of the experiments, particularly -as the same Ccurious circumstance had taken place at Unst, at which station however the unfavourable weather prevented the commencement of my observations, until the acceleration had nearly attained its maximum. To satisfy myself on this point, I took down the clock on the 13th August, and having carefully cleaned it, began a new series of observations, which are given at large in the Appendix, and from which the following tables and results are derived: Transits observed at Po vrsoy. zd Series.

The mean height of the barometer was So0,g inches, and that of the thermometer 60o,2, hence the correction for the buoyancy of the atmosphere is 6,o7. 3G5 Capt. KATER'S experiments for determining the variation This correction, together with 0,23 (the correct-Ion for the height above the sea) being added to the mean number of vibrations, we have 86o86,lo for the number of vibrations which would be made in a mean solar day, in vacuo, and at the level of the sea. The difference between this result and that of the first series of experiments made under the most unfavourable circumstances of acceleration in the rate of the clock, being only 0o, affords it is presumed a most satisfactory proof that no very important error is to be dreaded from this source in the observations at UnstOperations at Leith Fort. Having completed the requisite observations for the latitude of my station, and for connecting it with Cowhythe, I quitted Portsoy for Edinburgh on the 2oth August, leaving the instruments and party to come by sea. Leith Fort was my next station, and here, as I could procure no lodgings in the neighbourhood, an officer of the Royal Artillery most kindly relinquished to me his quarters in the barracks. The Cherokee arrived on the 28th, and the instrux ments were landed the same evening. On my first arrival at Edinburgh to embark for Unst, I had been introduced to Sir HOWARD ELPHINSTONE, the chief engineer of thestation, and received from him the assurance of every assistance in my experiments, which his department could furnish. Though to my regret he was now absent on duty, I was promptly supplied with such materials and artificers as were necessary, and on the 2g9th August my apparatus was firmly put up in one of the public store rooms of the Fort, which was excellently adapted to the purpose, and the in the length of the pencdulumn vibrating seconds. 365 transit instrument placed on a massy stone foundation, erected for it on the ramparts. On the 31st of August I comnmenced my observations, the results of which are given in the following Tables, and on the evening of the 7th of September, the transits of the same stars were again observed, but unfortunately the lamp which was attached to the meridian mark, for adjusting the transit instrument by night, not having been properly placed, these observations were of necessity rejected.

BIOT, in his late laborious experiments on the length of thependulum, and which seems capable of great accuracy. For this purpose I used a powerful --achromatic telescope, with which I was favoured by Mr. JARDINE from the observatory. The tele. scope was placed so as to rest against the door way of the room which contained the clock, and was directed towards the side of the steeple. On the evening of the Both AUgLust, I ob-. tained observations of the time of the disappearance of several stars, and on the 6th of September, two of these stars were again observed, but the rest were not visible. By these stars, in the length of the pendulum vibrating seconds. 367 the rate of the clock appeared to be 26s,85; which rate as it was deduced from the longest interval, has been used in computing the following Table.

On accousnt of this acceleration it becomes necessary to apply a correction, in the manner which has been before explained, in order to obtain the true number of vibrations made by the pendulum in a mean solar day. The results are contained in the following rTable. 368 Capt. KATER'S experiments for determining the variat ion By the Stars. ist. Series. LEITH FORT. Computed VibraMean of Corrected vibra.

The mean height of the barometer was 29,75 inches, and the mean temperature 59',6. The correction for the buoyancy of the atmosphere is therefore 5,99. The height of the pendulum above low water, was found by levelling to be 68 feet, whence we have o,28 x 16 6 _ oi8 for the correction due to this elevation. These corrections being applied, we obtain 86079,37 for the number of vibrations made by the pendulum in a mean solar day in vacuo, and at the level of the sea. The clock was now taken down to be cleaned, as I had resolved to go through a new series of observations. On examining the oil, it was found to all appearance as pure as in the lengtb of the pendulum vibrating seconds. 369 when first applied, and I can in no way account for the acceleration in) the rate of the clock, but by suipposing, that whilst it was at rest, the external surface of the oil had become thickened by some action of the sea air upon it. This would of course occasion the rate to be less, on the clock being first put up, and a gradual acceleration would afterwards take place as the thick coat Of the oil becan e blended with the more fluid particles beneath. These remarks may perhaps warrant the important inference, that no reliance whatever can be placed on results obtained by means of a pendulum attached to a clock, and that until oil can be banished from chronometers, and the maintaining power be such as to be equal utnder all circumstances, we may spare ourselves the trouble oQf attending to other sources of error. The clock being cleaned, the observations were made and the results deduced which are contained in the following Tables. Transits observed at LEITH FoRT. zd Series. Stars. September s.

On the 17th of September I left Edinburgh, and proceeded to Clifton in Yorkshire at which place my instruments and partv arrived on the 28th. Here I was so fortunate as to meet with a vacant house in the village, perfectly suited to my purpose, belonging to Mr. MILWARDw ho is also proprietor of the field in which is the station of the Trigonometrical Survey.

The height of the barometer being 29,23 inches, and the thermometer 550,o the resulting correction for the buoyancy of the atmosphere is 5,94 The height of Clifton Beacon, above the level of the sea is stated in the," Account of the Trigonometrical Survey" to be 417 feet; and by levelling, the pendulum was found to be 78 feet below Clifton Beacon, the height of the pendulum therefore above the level of the sea was 339 feet, the correction for which is 1,40 x I =o -0,95. Applying these corrections, we obtain 86068,90 for the number of vibrations at Clifton, in a mean solar day, in vacuo and sat the level of the sea. Operations at Arbury Hill. On the iath of October I left Clifton, having previously made some important observations for the latitude, which will be detailed in the proper place, and proceeded to Arbury Hill, where ny party and instrumeents arrived on the 1ith. Here I procured accommodations at a house belonging to Mr. GosSAGE, situated on the side of an eminence, to the south of Arbury Hill. The season was now so far advanced, and the weather in consequence so variable, that it was not until the 21st that I was able to commence my observations. These though few in number, were made with such mninute precautions, and under such favourable circumstances, as to be perfectly satisn factory to me.

The elevation of Arbury Hill above the sea, as determined by the Trigonometrical Survey, is 804 feet, from which deducting 67 feet, (the height of the tent being 11 feet,) we obtain 737 feet for the elevation of the pendulum above the in the length of the pendulum vibrating seconds& 7 level of the sea, the correction for which is 3,0 x s = i These corrections being applied, we Ihave 86065,05 for the number of vibrations which would be made by the pendulum in a mean solar day in vacuo an d at the level of the sea. On leaving ArIbury Hill, I hastened to' Dunnose in the Isle of Wight, anxious to complete my experiments before the winter; but on arriving there, I found the weather sv bad, that after a short stay I was reluctantly obli ed to postpone my observations at that station until the following $pring9 Operations at Londo, Before I left London in June, I took four series of vibrations of the pendulum at a high temperature, at Mr. BROWNE'8 house in Portland Place; chiefly with a view to afford me the means of checking my expansion of the pendulum by a comparison with other series of vibrations, which I purposed to observe at a low temperature on my return, and also to enable me to form some idea of the acceleration, when I should arrive at Unst., For the rate of the clock I am indebted to the observations of Mr. BROWNE.

Operations at the Isle of .ight. On the 8th May 1819, I again left London for the Isle of Wight. Dunnose, the most southern station of the meridional arc of the Trigonometrical Survey, is marked by an iron gun, sunk in the ground on the summit of a hill near the village of Shanklin, a little to the north of a signal post,* lThe nearest house to this station is Shanklin Farm, in the occupation of Mr. JOLLIFFE, from whomn and from the proprietor, the Rev. Mr. WHITE, I mnost readily received permission to make use of a summer house, well suited to the purpose, for my experiments. The observations made at this station are detailed in the Appendix. The weather was very favourable after the 2ath ; and though before that period I was not able to obtain the transit of more than one star and of the sun, these observations were satisfactory.

The mean height of the barometer being 3o,o9 inches, and that of the thermometer 600,9, the correction for the buoyancy of the atmosphere is 6,09. It may be seen in the Appendix, that the height of Dunnose above the summer house, deduced from the distance and angle of elevation of the signal post, is 5jg feet; and as Dunnose is stated, in the Trigonometrical Survey, to be 792 feet above the level of the sea, this would give BU5 feet for the elevation, of the pendulum above the sea. But by observations made with a barometer of Sir HARRY ENGLEFIELD'S construction, on three several days, the greatest difference of the results being eight feet, the mean elevation of the summer house above high swater mark appeared to be 221 feet; and if io feet be allowed for the fall of the tide, we have 231 feet, or the height of the pendulum above low water, differing zn the length of the pendulum'm vibrating seconds. 83 from the former result es feet. The height of Dunnose above the summer house, was also deduced baromnetrically, and appeared to be 13 feet, differing from the trigonometrical determination 26 feet in defect. If this difference be attributed to error in the barometer} as is most probably the fact, the proportional error in the elevation of the summer house, determined barometrically, 1will be i i feet, and this being added to 231 feet, we have 242 feet for the height of the pendulum above the level of the sea, which is probably within eleven feet of the truth. The correction due to an elevation of 242 feet, is o,997 x oh,7; and this, together with the correction for the buoyancy of the atmosphere being added to the number of vibrations before found, we obtain 86058,o7 for the number of vibrations which would be made by the pendulum in a mleati solar day, in vacuo, and at the level of the sea. ,38 Capt. KATER'S expeiments for determining the variation Of the Latitudes and Longitudes of the diferent Stations. The daily rate of Mr. BROwNE's chronometer before I left London, was ot.,2 the chronometer being too slow for Greenwich, time on the i5th June 1?i>75; but this rate, as might have been expected, varied from the motifon of the waggon or other causes, so that at Unst,' its mean rate was -is 3i, at Portsoy -1,7, and at Leith,2`42, which rates are deduced from the column headed " chronometer," in the table of transits given in the Appendix. The meridian of my station at Leith Fort, passed within go feet of that of the observatory on the Calton Hill, the longil" tude of which Mr. JARDINE, who has the care of the observatory, informed me, is w9m*46'7 west of Greenwich, which may also be considered as the longitude of my station. At Leith Fort, on the 17th September, by two sets of altitudes of the sun, taken with the repeating circle and given in the Appendix, the chronometer was found to be 8m.41$,6 too fast, and as it was slow at Greenwich on the i5th June imai,7s, it had lost between that period and the 1.7th, September, 2X.49',35, which is at the rate of &,,8 daily. At Unst, by four series of altitudes of the sun, taken on the a2d July with the repeating circle, (which I conceive it is unnecessary to detail, as the results differed very little from each other) the chronometer appeared to be 5os,2 fast, to which V?15s,75 being added, and also i,=.6,s6 (the loss of the chronometer in 37 days) we obtain 3I2,55 for the longitude of Unst in time, west of Greenwich. Again. Taking Leith for the point of departure, we have the chronometer fist on the 17th September 8 4Ia,6, and at zn the length of the pendulum vibrating seconds. 385 Unst, on the 22d July, 503,2. The mean of the rates of the chronometer at Unst, Portsoy, and Leith, gives 13,81 for the mean daily rate, which being multiplied by 57, the number of days between the 22d of July and the 17th September, we have 1?43,17 for the loss of the chronometer during that period. This being added to 8R.416,6, we obtain iom.243,77 for the error of the chronometer on the 22d July, for the meridian of Leith, and subtracting 5o$,2 (the error at Unst) the remainder 9's4s,7 will be the longitude of Unst, east of Leith, Now the longitude of Leith being 12"m46$,7 west, the difference 31Q24,13 will be the longitude of Unst, west of Greenwich. This agreeing so nearly with the preceding result, may perhaps be considered as not very far from the truth. At Portsoy on the Ed August, the chronometer was found to be 7`.52'3 too fast, by altitudes of the sun, which are detailed in the Appendix. The loss of the chronometer from the i1th June to the 3d August, at the daily rate of r,8 is I .28 ,? ; which, together with .1.Iss,75 (the error of the chronometer at Greenwich on the 1ith June) being added to 7?n52,, we obtain ioa.36'%5 for the longitude of Portsoy, west of Greenwich. In order to deduce the longitude of Portsoy from that of Unst, we have the chronometer fast at Unst on the 22d July 50',3, and at Portsoy on the 3d August 7m'528,3. TFhe mean of the daily rates at Unst and Portsoy is 5,i, and the loss from the a2d July to the 3d August, at this rate, is i8s)12i Hlencc we have Portsoy west of Unst 7?20$'o22 atd the Iongitude of Unst from Greenwich being 3ra18a,87, we have the MDtCCXGX. 3 E 8 6 Capt. KATER'S experiments for determining the variatz&n longitude of Portsoy io?-39,8og west of' Greenwich. The mean of this, and the preceding result being lo,,_7 67, ISI perhaps not many seconds distant from the truth. I must bow ever remark, that from the variation in the rate of the chronometer, I do not rely upon these longitudes beyond the purpose to which they are tobe applied, that of finding the sun's declinationat apparent noon.The instrument used for determining the latitudes, was the repeating circle, of one fbot diameter, mentioned at the commencement of this Paper. Of the power of the repeating circle I had ever entertained the most favourable opinion; and I had now an opportunity of bringing it to the test of experimeent, by connecting my stations with those of the trigonometrical survey, and comparing the latitudes obtained by the repeating circle with those deduced from observations made with the zenith sector. As an error in latitude amounting to one minute, would not occasion a difference of one tenth of -a vibration of the pendulum in 94 hours, I conceived it would have been an expense of time, which I could ill affiord, to have waited for multiplied observations, except at certain stations,, the latitudes of which I was anxious to ascertain with particular accuracy. By the mean, of numerous readings, I found the correction for the index error of my instrument to be + 18-"; and the value of each division of thelarge level to be 29,"4. In order to deduce the meridional, zenith distance, from observations made near the meridian, I availed myself of a very convenient formula, forwhich It was indebted to Dr. YOUNG and which has since been published, together withu a small table of verse sines, by order of the Commissioners of in the length of the pendulum vibrating seconds, ag87 Longitude. The refractions and corrections for the baromer r and thermometer, are taken from Dr. BRINKLEY's Tables, published with the observations made at the Royal Observatory at Greenwich. In observations of the sun, the horary angle is estimated in solar time, but in those of the stars it must be expressed in sidereal time. It is most convenient, however, to employ the angle given by the chronometer in finding the correction of the apparent zenith distance, and afterwards to apply a further correction in the following manner. Let r, be the daily loss of the chronometer on solar or sidereal time, according as the sun or star is observed; and let .Then calling the correction before found C, the T864Qo-r final correction will be ( C + 2 r'C). If the clock gain upon the star, C must be diminished by the quantity 2 r' C. In using the repeating circle, it is of great importance that its plane should be truly vertical, or that its deviation should be known, in order to find the correction to be added on this account to the observed zenith distance. On my return to London, I found the error of my circle in this respect to be 1'.48 the correction for which may be obtained by the following formula: Sin.3( _Sn ,1 where z is the true zenith distance, z' the observed zenith distance, and I, the angle of inclination of the plane of the circle. In the second member of the equation, Z may be taken = z' without error. These formulae, as well as many others respecting the repeating circle, is demonstrated by M, BIOT, in his valuable " Traite 6l6mentaire d'Astronomnie Physique. 388 Capt. KATER'S experiments for determining the variation At Unst, the following series of observations for the zenith distance of the sun's upper limb was made under-the most favourable circumstances. The calculation of the latitude of this, as well as of the other stations, is given at length, to afford the opportunity of any examination that may be thought desirable. UNST. 23d July, i8I8.

Adding this to the observed latitude, we have 6oP451,28", for the latitude of the stationi where the experiments with the pendulum were made. The latitude of the spot where M. Bioer's apparatus was fixed, and which was on the same parallel with mine, was determined by Lieut. Col. MUDGE, by connecting it with his station on the island of Balta, where the zenith sector was erected, to be 60o.45 .29",6. But this latitude is dependent on that of Greenwich, which was taken at 5zi. 28'. 4o0'" By the observations however of the present Astronomer Ro3yal, and the use of the French refractions which Are very nearly the same as those of Dr. BRINKLEY, the latitude of Greenwich appears to be 51?.8'.38",o1, or 1",99 less than by former observations. This quantity being subtracted from Gol MUDGE'S determination, we have 6.?45'.27",61 for the latitude of the pendulum at Unst, deduced from the Trigonometrical Survey, and 6.4 '.928",2 by one series of zenith disc tances of the sun, taken with the repeating circle.

These observations for connecting my station with Cowhythe were made under various unfavourable circumstances, and indeed I am not quite sure that the object I took on Knock Hill was in fact the station; for a pole originally placed in the centre of a cone of masonry, as at Cowhythe, has been taken away, and it was some time before I could decide which to chooseamong two or three eminences resembling each other, which happen to be upon the hill. The preceding result therefore can be considered only as a proof that no error of consequence is to be feared in my determi. nation of the latitude of Portsoy. Latitude of Leith Fort.

Latitude of Clifton. In an account of the measurement of an arc of the merin dian," by Lieut. Col. MUDGE, a singular anomaly presents itself, which since the year 1802, when this measurement was made has been considered with much interest, and in various points of view by the scientific world. Instead of the degrees of the meridian increasing with the latitude, as is the case in an oblate spheroid, they appear by this measurement to decrease. This remarkable circumstance was examined by Don JOSEPH RODRIGUEZ in an ingenious paper published in -the Philosophical Transactions for 1812. The author pro.ceeding according to a method of verification given by M. DELAMBRE in the " Base M~trique," calculates upon the ellip. tic hypothesis the length of the whole arc and of each of its parts in seconds, and from the observed latitude of Clifton, the northern extremity of the arc, deduces that of Dunnose, the southern extremity, and of Arbury Hill, an intermediate station which divides the total arc into two nearly equal parts. Don JOSEPH RODRIGUEZ then compares the celestial arcs given by Col. MUDGE's observations, with those resulting from his own calculations, and concludes that the total observed arc between Clifton and Dunnose is in excess 1"1,38; that, between Clifton and Arbury 4',77; and that the southern portion of the arc between Arbury Hill and Dunnose, is 31,39 in defect. The author adds that" it seems almost beyond a doubt, that it is to errors in the observations of latitude, "that the appearance of progressive augmentation of degrees "towards the equator is to be ascribed," and that " it is espen 396 Capt. KATER'S expe iments for determining the variation cially at the intermediate station at Arbury Hill, that the "observations of the stars are erroneous nearly ,5", notwith. standing the goodness of the instruments and the skill and " care of the observer." An error at Arbury Hill arnounting to s"', could scarcely be supposed possible with such an instrument as the zenith sector, in the hands of Col. MUDGE; and the less so, from its appearing that the latitude of Blenheim, deduced trigonoinetrically from that of Arbury Hill, differed only a fraction of a second from the latitude obtained by the observations made with RAMSDEN's quadrant at Blenheim observatory. On the other hand, it is not surprising that so great a deviation of the plumb line from the vertical as 5",* which would indicate the existence of a disturbing force very nearly equal to that exerted by the mountain Schehallion, should be received with much caution. It became therefore very desirable to endeavour to throw some light on this interesting questions by additional observations at Clifton, Arbury Hill, and Dunnose, for the latitudes of those important stations, an operation to which I felt confident that my repeating circle would not be found inadequate. Before I proceed to detail the observations made at Clifton, I must observe, that in the repeating circle, as usually constructed in England, the level turns on the axis, and when clamped, is carried with the circle, which renders an additional operation necessary at each repetition, to bring hack the level to its former horizontal position. Imagining that if I could obviate this, it would be a considerable saving of time, I had a * The weight of the plumb line is drawn towards the north and not to the south, as is stated by Col. MuDGJ, who probably meant to express the direction of the inclination from the vertical. ?n the length of the pendulum vibrating seconds, 397 contrivance executed at Edinburgh, by which I could fix the level very firmly in its horizontal position to the pillar of the instruiwent, This being done, the following observations were mnade for the zenith distance of the pole star. The corrections for precession, &c are those used, at the Royal Observatory at Greenwich, and the mean polar distance of the pole star is that resulting from the latest observations of the Astronomer Royal. The transit instrument was within one second in time of the meridian, the error of the chronometer was therefore deduced from the passage of the sun. CLIFTON, 3d October, 18I8.

For in turning the telescope on its axis, the friction, however slight it may be, tends to disturb the relative position of the circle 400 Capt. KATER's expeimnents for determining the variation and level, and thus to introduce error. In the usual construction the level may be clamped to the circle, and then it moves with it without any risk of derangement. This con struction was indispensable, in order that the instrument might be used for taking terrestrial angles, and it is to this, perhaps originally accidental circumstance, that the repeating circle is indebted for its very near approach to perfection, After I had restored the instrument to its former state, the following observations were made.

Before I availed myself of the distance of Laughton spire from Clifton Beacon, I had measured a base of 797 feet for the same purpose, and this gave the distance of the chimney from Clifton Beacon on the meridian 1323 feet ; but as I could not see the same part of the chimney from both ends of the base, this determination serves merely to check that before given, and to render it highly probable that there cannot be an error of i o feet, and perhaps not near so much in the distance first stated. The observed arc between Greenwich and Clifton Beacon, in the length of thependulum vibrating seconds, 403 by the Trigonometrical Survey, is 1to.58. 'mg",Sj, andthisbeing added to 51o028'.3811,o1 (the latitude of Greenwich) gives 53!.!7'.29"',6o for the latitude of Clifton Beacon, differing only O",29 in defect, from the result obtained by the repeating circle, and affording, it is presumed, a satisfactory proof (as far as this instrument is entitled to credit) of the accuracy of the observations made with the zenith sector, both at Clifton Beacon and at Greenwich. Latitude of Arbury Hill. The season was so far advanced when I arrived at this important station thiat I could not expect numerous observations for the latitude; but from the near agreement of the results at Clifton, I was encouraged to hope that the observations at Arbury Hill, though few in number, might prove satisfactory. The bell tent was pitched on the old station of the Trigonometrical Survey, where the theodolite was placed. This spot may be readily ascertained from Col. MUDGE'S description, to within io feet. Pickets were driven into the ground, on which rested the legs of a very stout triangular stand, which served as a support to the Repeating Circle. Every precaution which I could think of was used to ensure accuracy. The instrument was adjusted, the telescope directed to the star, and the whole left for nearly half an hour before the com. rnencement of the observations, in.order that it might acquire an equal temperature. When the wire was brought very nearly to bisect the star, the tangent screw was turned a little in an opposite direction to release it from any strain, and the hand being withdrawn, the star was watched until its bisection was perfect. The time was then noted, and the level carefully 404 Cat KATR'S experimentsfor determining the variation read off by the non-commmissioned officer and myself, without either of us moving froi the place wheie we stood; In this manner the three following series of observations were made.

In the "c Account of the Trigonometrical Survey," Col. MUDGE states, that the zenith sector was put up 3+ feet to the north and 28 feet to the west of the old station at Arbury Hill; therefore o,34j' must be added, on this account, to obtain 52o.I3I25I)72, the latitude of the spot where the zenith sector was placed, in the length of the penduluin vibrating seconds. 407 The observed arc between Greenwich and Arbury Hill, is oO,44I.48/,19, which being added to the latitude of Greenwich, gives 520.13'.26"1,2o for the latitude of Arbury Hill by theTrigonometrical Survey, which differs o",48 in excess, from the latitude given by the Repeating Circle. We cannot then but conclude, that the observations made with the zenith sector, both at Clifton and Arbury Hill, are free from any material error; and as the difference be. tween the latitudes of Clifton by the Zenith Sector, and by the Repeating Circle, was o"tg9, that by the Zenith Sector being in defect, and of Arbury Hill o"',48 in excess, it is extremely probable that the error of observation at either of these stations does not amount to so mnuch as four-tenths of a second. A base of 906 feet was carefully measured near the foot of Arbury Hill, for the purpose of finding the distance on the meridian of this station from the pendulum; which distance, as appears in the Appendix, was 3o48 feet, the pendulum being so nearly in the meridian of the station, that no deduce tion on account of its bearing is necessary. The arc corresponding to 3048 feet, is o",-o6, which being subtracted from 52? l,'5f2` leaves 52?0.2'55'132 for the latitude of the pendulu lvi. Latitude of the Station at London.

KATER'S experimhents for determining the variation Latitude of Shianklin Farm. Having observed for the latitude of Arbury Hill, at the station itself, it was my intention to have done the same at Dunnose, but this, from the distance of the station, and the difficulty of the ascent, I found impracticable. My observations therefore were mnade on a spot which was 2o feet south of the chimney of the summer-house in which the pendulum was placed. Previously to quitting London, the transverse level of the repeating circle was adjusted so as to render any correction unnecessary, and the axis carrying the telescope having been tightened, the index error was again carefully determined, and found to be 1is". The observations were made under circumstances peculiarly favourable, and though those forming the second series are few in number, in consequence of the pole star having been frequently obscured by light clouds, I consider them as unexceptionable.

I had now to connect my station with that of Dunnose; a work attended with some difficulty, as Shanklin farm could not be seen from it, and the nature of the ground was very 412 Capt. KATER'S experiments for del rinning the variation unfavourable to the mneasureinent of a base. The signal post however was visible from the farm, and I selected the most level part of the hill I could find, on which, with the assistance of Mr. FRANKS, I measured a line of 1140 feet. The angles were taken with the greatest care, and are given with the other necessary data in the Appendix, from which the distance frromi Dwu-nose to the chimney of the summer house appears to be S9.ot feet, and its bearing 6o' 58' 1 1" to the north east; whence the distance on the meridian is 1893 feet, or 1.8" .67. The distance from the signal post was also calculated, and found to differ only one foot from that of the station. Fearing from the nature of the ground on which the base was measured, that this determination might be erroneous, I was anxious to verify it by some other method. For this purpose I chose a spot on the side of the hill, which was very level, on which I measured with great care a distance of 1oo yards. The direction of this base wleas perpendicular to a line joining the summer house and the signal post, in which line was also its commencement. I then measured the distance from the signal post to the corn riencement of the base. By means of eight repetitions with the Repeating Circle, the angle subtended by this base, at a spot 22 feet from the chimney of the summeI house towards the signal post, was determined with great precision; and having also the angle of elevation) the horizontal distance from the commencement of the base was obtained, to which 22 feet being added, and also the measured distance from the base to the Signal Post, the result was 3896 feet, for the distance from the Signal Post, to the chimney of the summer house, differing only four feet from the former ,de,!term,.;inatin . in the length of the pendulum vibrating seconds. 413 If from 5O'.37'.23",94 (the latitude of the summer house) iS'8,67 be subtracted, we have 5o0.37t .5",27 for the latitude of Dunnose by the Repeating Circle. The latitude of Dunnose is stated in the "' Account of the Trigonometrical Survey," to be 50.37I.8/",6, on the supposition of that of Greenwvich being 51 .28'140o'. But this latitude, as before stated, is found from the more recent observations of the present Astronomer Royal, to be 1",99 in excess, if the French refractions be employed; therefore 5o0*37 '.6i,61 is the latitude of Dunnose by the Trigonometrical Survey, differing 1",34 in excess from the result obtained by the Repeating Circle. :1 may here remark, that the latitude of Dunnose deduced from the observations made with the Repeating Circle, differs only o"to,o from the latitude of that station given in the first volume of the account of the survey, and which appears to hbave been derived trigonometrically from the latitude of Greenwich. 414 Capt. KATER's experimentsfor determining the variation, Results of the preceding Operations. It now remains to give in one view, the results of the operations that have been detailed. These are comprised in the following table. It would have been desirable to have expressed the length of the pendulum vibrating seconds, in parts of the scale which forms the basis of the Trigonometrical Survey of Great Britain, the Commissioners of Weights and Measures having agreed to recommend, that "; the standard "used in the Trigonometrical Survey of Great Britain should "be considered as affording the most authentic determination " of the linear measure of the United Kingdom." But as experiments are yet wanting to enable me to do this with sufficient accuracy, I have given the length of the pendulum in parts of Sir GEORGE SHUCKBURGIHS standard scale, the correction for the difference between which, and the national standard of linear measure, may be readily applied hereafter. The length of the pendulum vibrating seconds in the latitude of London, is stated in the Phil. Trans. for i8i8, to be 39,1386o inches. But I have here to notice a very important omission, which I am, obliged to Mr. TROUGHTONfOr having pointed out in the first number of the Edinburgh Philosophical Journal. It may be seen that in computing the spec ftc gravity of the pendulum, I have neglected to include the deal ends. Anxious to supply this omission in the most unexceptionable manner, I thought it best to take the specific gravity of the whole pendulum, and for this purpose requested Mr. BARTON, Comptroller of his Majesty's Mint, to allow me the use of the fine balance lately constructed under his directions, a request with which he in the length of the pendulum vibratzng seconds. 4 most obligingly complied, anid favoured me with his assistance, and with every requisite for making the experiment. A deal trough was prepared seven feet long, nine inches wide, and the same depth. The pendulum was slung horizontally from the scale pan, by a fine iron wire. The weight of the wvhole was carefully determined in air, and found to be 669o4 grains. The trough whichl had been previously placed beneath the pendulum, was then filled with distilled water, and the weight of water displaced was found to be 9066 grains. The small portion of iron wire which was immersed in the water was carefully noted; the weight of the wire by which the pendulum was suspended was 56 grains, and the weight of water equal in bulk to that part of the wire which was immersed was 2,5 grains. The temperature of the water was 68?, and that of the atmosphere 620 ; the barometer eg,9 inches. Hence we have the weight of the pendulum 66858,8 grains in vacuo at the temperature of 629; the weight of an equal bulk of water at the same temperature, 9068,4 grains; and the resulting specific gravity of the pendulum, 7,3727. Employing this spec ftc gravity in computing the allowance for the mean buoyancy of the atmosphere, zue obtain oo624 for this correction instead of ,00545, tie former rroneous conclusion. Besides this, the allowance + ,ooo~3i for the height of the pendulum above the level of the sea, should, according to Dr. YOUNG'S investigation, have been mnldtiplied by -6-6making 4+ o00021 of an inch. These corrections blhing applied, ze have 39,139c29 inc/es of Sir Go SHUCKBURGII'S standard sc Ic, for the length of the pendulam vibrating seconds in the latitude of London. Wishing to compare with, this, thie result which would have been obtained by means of the veights and specific gravities of the different parts of ithe pendulum, I carefully measured 416 Capt. KATER's experiments for determining the variation the deal ends, and found them to contain 3,956 cubic inches. The weight of the knife edges was 370 grains, and their specific gravity 7,84. With these data, and taking the specific gravity of deal at 0,49; the specific gravity of the whole pendulum will be found to vary from the more accurate determination above given, a quantity which would have occasioned a difference in the length of the seconds pendulum of only I of an inch.

If the earth were a perfect sphere, composed of homogeneous materials, as a fluid, and at rest, gravity at every point in its surface would be the same. But if this sphere were made to revolve about an axis, its particles would endeavour to fly off with a centrifugal force proportionate to the distance from the axis of rotation; the equatorial parts would become elevated, those at the pole and its vicinity depressed, and the sphere would assume the form of a spheroid, the centrifugal force thus generated acting in opposition to gravity, and diminishing it more and more from the Pole, where the cen. trifugal force is nothing, to the Equator where it is a maximum. But besides this diminution of gravity from centrifugal force, in proceeding from the pole to the equator, a farther reduction takes place in consequence of the elliptical form which the earth has now assumed. For the parts about the Pole being nearer to the centre of the spheroid than those at the Equator, will be more strongly attracted, and this farther reduction of gravity, whatever it may be, varies with the figure of the earth, and as we shall presently see, with a variation in the density of the strata of which it is composed. If we conceive two fluid columns meeting in the centre of such a spheroid, the one proceeding from the Pole and the MDCCCXIX. 3 I 41-8 Capt. KATER'S experiments for determining the variation othtter from the Equator, it follows in order that the spheroid may preserve a state of equilibrium, that the pressure of the equatorial and polar columns on the centre must be equaL The equatorial column then has been lengthened in proportion to the diminution of its gravity. The ellipticity therefore, and the diminution of gravity from the Pole to the Equator, will, on this supposition of a homogenous spheroid, be enx pressed by the same fraction, which NEWTON has demonstrated to be 2. If now we suppose new matter to be added to the centre of such homogeneous spheroid, or its density there to be increased, this matter, by its additional attraction, will cause a greater increase of gravitation at the Pole than at the Equator, in consequence of the distance from the Pole to the centre being the less; but the equatorial column being the longer, and therefore consisting of a greater quantity of matter, its gravity or pressure on the centre will be more increased by this new attraction than that of the polar column; and in order to restore the equilibrium thus destroyed, the polar column must become long-er, and the equatorial column shorter than before. Thus the ellipticity of the spheroid will be diminished but the difference of gravitation at the Pole and at the Equator will, at the same time, be increased. HUYGENS considered the whole attractive force to reside in the centre, or the earth to be infinitely dense there, and on this supposition, computing its ellipticity, he round it to be But experiments with the pendulum soon sufficiently proved that the earth was neither homogeneous, nor, it is scarcely necessary to say, infinitely dense at its centre; but that it in the length of the Pendulum vibrating seconds. 419 probably increased in density from, the surface to the ceCitr e the ellipticity being consequently somewhere betxween Ti8 and 3' As it appears then that the ellipticity of the earth varies with any difference in the diminution of gravitation from tie Pole to the Equator, and that this last depends in its turn on the "ellipticity; it might have been supposed that any attempt to arrive at the figure of the earth in this way must have been hopeless. But it was reserved for CLAIRAUT to remove this difficulty. He found that however the density of the earth be supposed to vary, the fraction expressing its ellipticity increases as the fraction expressing the diminution of gravity from the pole to the equator diminishes, and vice versa; and in his admirable work on the figure of the earth, he has demonstrated this beautiful and important theorem; that the sum of the two fractions expressing the ellipticity and the diminution of gravity from the Pole to the Equator, is always a constant quantity, and equal to A of the fraction expressing the ratio of centrifugal force, to that of gravity at the equator. If then the decrease of gravity from the Pole to the Equator can be discovered, and it be subtracted from this constant quantity, the remainder will be the fraction expressing the ellipticity of the spheroid. The diminution of gravity may be knownn by finding the difference of the lengths of the two pendulums vibrating in equal times at the Pole and at the Equator, as it may be easily demonstrated that the lengths of such pendulums are to each other directly as gravitation; or, if an invariable pendulu-ni such as I have used, be employed, the squares of the observed 4,o (rapt. KATER'S experiments for determining the variation number of vibrations in 24 hours, in different latitudes, will be to each other as gravitation in such latitudes. But as experiments on the pendultm cannot be made at the Pole, it remains to describe the manner in which the diminution of gravity from the Pole to the Equator, may be obtained by observations made at intermediate stations. I have remarked, that the centrifugal force varies as the distance from the axis of rotation ; that is as the cosine of the latitude; thus at the Equator it is the greatest, at the Poles it is nothing, But the whole of the centrifugal force does not act in opposition togravity except at the Equator; for let cd be thedirection of gravity, Jb that of centrifugal force, and let the centrifugal force for the latitude a, be expressed by the line ab; if this be resolved into two forces ad and db, that portion which acts 'in opposition to gravity wvill be expressed by ad. But if ab be made the radius, ad is the cosine of the angle dab, acr, the latitude of the point a. The effect then of the centrifugal force at a, in counteracting gravity, is' still farther diminished in the proportion of the cosine of the latitude to the radius; -whence it follows, that the diminution of gravity from this cause, in proceeding from the Pole to the Equator, will be as the difference of the squares of the cosines of the latitudes. From the expression for the force of gravity at the surface of a spheroid,* we may readily perceive that that part of the *4X ( I + 4.4 in @Q) in which the sin; ; is the only variable quaritity, p being the angle of the terrestrial radius with the Equator. in the length ofhe pendulum vibrating seconds. q diminution which depends on the elliptical form of the earth follows very nearly the same law; therefore the increase of gravitation in proceeding from the Equator to the Pole, may be taken as the increase of the square of the sine of the latitude; X and this will also express the corresponding variation in the length of the pendulum. Let E The length of the pendulum vibrating seconds at the Equator. d= The difference between the length at the Equator and at the Pole. m The length of the pendulum in the latitude L. n The length of the pendulum in the latitude L. Then from what has been stated, m CNE + d. sin2 L n =E + d. sin" L' in n (E + d sin' L)(E + d sin2 L') = d(siwe Lsin L') mn-n Hence dsin (L?') x sin (L L') and EF me -(d sin2 L.) Therefore Ed expresses the diminution of gravity from the Pole to the Equator, which being subtracted from 52 of the proportion of. centrifugal force to gravity at the Equator, will give the ellipticity of the spheroid. The centrifugal force at the Equator is expressed by the deflection of a point on its surface from the tangent, in one second of mean solar time. This is equal to the versed sine of 15",0418, the arc wvhich the earth describes in its diurnal revolution in one second; and taking the radius of the Equator at 3967,5 miles is found to be ,o55696 of a foot. 5 The sin1 + the cosine 2 is a constant quantity, equal to the radius1, consequently as the cosine f diminishes, the sine1 must increase, and vice versa. 42 2 Capt.

The length of the pendulum vibrating seconds at the equator, deduced from the observations at Unst and Dunnose, by the preceding formula, appears to be 39,oo734 inches, and g, or gravitation at the Equator, to be equal to 16,412 feet.

KATER'S experiments for determining the variation Report, it appears probable, that if the uncertainty which must exist in the allowance for the height above Sthe level of the sea be excepted, the error in the number of vibrations of the pendulum at any particular station, does not amount to so much as one tenth of a vibration, which is nearly equivalent to 40'0I part of the length of the seconds pendulum. To this degree of accuracy consequently may gravitation be determined by the apparatus I have employed; and in passing through a country composed of materials of various densities, the pendulum may be expected to indicate such variation with very considerable precision. The diminution of gravity fromts the Pole to the Equator is derived from the decrease which is observed to take place between any two given latitudes ; consequently if no irregular attraction occurred, the results, computed from diffelrent portions of the meridian, should be the same. But it may be seen in the preceding table, that the number expressing the diminution of gravity, from the observations at Unst and Portsoy, is less than that deduced fromn the arc between Unst and Leith, and that this number goes on increasing to Clifton, diminishes at Arbury Hill, and increases again at London. It may also be remarked, that the diminution of gravity, derived from Unst and Dunnose, is less than that deduced from Portsoy and Dunnose; from all which it seems probable that in ad. vancing southward, gravity decreases more than it ought to do from theory; that there exists an assemblage of materials of greater density than common in the vicinity of Portsoy, and that the density of the strata to the southward becomes less and less until we arrive at Clifton, where it seems to be cons siderably in defect. At Arbury Hill, a sudden increase of gravitation is percept in the length of the pendulum vibrating seconds. 425 fible, and at the short distance of London, this additional force is no longer sensible. Fromn its intensity, and the limited sphere of its action, it might perhaps be inferred that the disturbing material is of considerable density, and not very distant from the surface. It must be evident that nothing very decisive respecting the ;eneral ellipticity of the Meridian can be deduced from the present experiments. For this purpose it is requisite that the extreme stations should comprise an arc of sufficient length to render the effect of irregular attraction insensible; and this effect might be dintinished, if not wholly prevented, by selects ing stations of sitnilar geological character, ard which should differ as little as possible in elevation above the level of the sea. If however some deduction be made for the superior density which it has been remarked exists at Portsoy, the com.pretssion 3 deduced from that station and Unst, may perhaps be considered as not far distant from the truth., both being situated on rocks of a similar nature; Unst consisting chiefly of serpentine, and Portsoy, of serpentine, slate, and granite ; and as -I-o the ellipticity given by the experiments at Unst and Arbury Hill, is nearly the same as that resulting from Unst and Portsoy, it would be no improbable conjecture that the sudden increase of gravitation observed at Arbury Hill, may be occasioned by a rock of primitive formation, approachingrthe surface of the earth in the vicinity of that station,* These facts appear sufficient to explain the anomalies which l Since the above was written, I find the conjecture I have hazarded remarkably supported by fact; for n consulting SM I T'Ws Geological Map of England, it appears that Mount Sorrel, a mass of granite, is situated, together with other rocks of prirnitivC formation., about 30 miles to the north of Arbury Hill. MvDCCCXIX 3 1* 426 Capt. KATER'S evperiments for determining the variation have been remarked in the Trigonometrical Survey of Great Britain. For if the disturbing force in the neighbourhood of Arbury Hill, were supposed to be situated to the north of that station, the plumb line would be attracted northward, the observed latitude would be less than the trues and the length of the degree deduced fron the arc between Dunnose and Arbury would be in excess, and that derived from the arc between Clifton and Arbury in defect. This last error will be augmented, if we suppose the attraction of the matter near Arbury Hill to be felt at Clifton, and the plumb line at that station to be drawn towards the south. M. BIOT, by a comparison of his numerous experiments at Unst with those, made at Formentara and Dunkirk, in cons junction with M. ARAGO, obtains I for the resulting compression. But if the allowance for the elevation of Formentara above the level of the sea, be corrected in the manner sugegested by Dr. YOUNG, the ellipticity should be about t49. The details of M. BIOT'S experiments have not yet been published, but tit affords me much gratification to learn, that the acceleration of the pendulum between London and Unst, computed by M. BioT, from his observations at Unst and those at Formentara, using L. for the compression, differs only o0,6 from the result of my experiments a difference which may probably be referred to the superior density of Unst, come pared with that of the substrata of Londonr London, J une, i 8 X 9 in the length of the pendultui ivibratig seconds. 7 APPENDIX.

The bearing of Sir RICHARD WORSLEY'S Obelisk, according to the Trigonometrical Survey, is 87?.42!.4o north-west from the meridian of Dunnose; therefore the bearing of the Sum-s mer house appears to be 60o.58'.11'I north-east, and the resulting distance on the meridian 1893 feet.

The Signal Post was carefully estimated to be 30 feet high, and Dunnose Station is about 7 feet below the base of the Signal Post. Deducting therefore 37 feet, we have 539 feet, for the elevation of Dunnose Station above the Pen. dulum. in the length of the pendulum vibrating seconds. goar By the Trigonometrical Survey, Dunnose appears to be 792 feet above the level of the sea; the height therefore of the Pendulum above the sea was 253 feet.
