[ 805 ] XXXVIII. Supplementary Observations on the Dffusion of Liquids. By THOMAS GRAHAM, F.R.S., F.C.S. Received May 2,-Read June 20, 1850. THE experiments of my former paper furnished strong grounds for believing that isomorphous salts possess a similar diffusibility. All the salts of potash and ammonia, which were compared, appeared to be equi-diffusive; so also were the salts of certain magnesian bases. A single preliminary observation on the nitrates of lead and baryta, however, opposed the general conclusion, and demanded further inquiry. It is scarcely necessary to say that any new means of recognizing the existence of the isornorphous relation between different substances, must prove highly valuable. Let us inquire therefore how far liquid diffusion is available for that purpose. The salts were still diffused from weak solutions, that is from solutions containing from I to 8 per cent. of salt; but now a measure of the solution, equal to 100 grs. of water, was made to contain I grain of the salt, to form what is called the 1 per cent. solution; instead of 1 grain of salt being added to 100 grs. of water, as before, without reference to the condensation which generally occurs. The quantities 1, 2, 4 and 8 per cent. thus indicate the parts of salt present in a constant volume of liquid,-as 10, 20, 40 and 80 grs. of the salt in 1000 water grain-measures of the solution. The same phials for the solution and jars for the external water-atmosphere continued to be used, and the manipulations were similar. It is believed, however, that the temperature of the liquids was maintained more uniform in the new experiments than the old, partly by the better regulation of the temperature of the apartment, and partly by placing the jars close together upon a table with upright ledges, and covering the whole over with sheets of paper during the continuance of an experiment. The mass of fluid in 80 or 100 jars, which were employed at once and placed together, made the small oscillations of temperature, which might still occur, slow and less injurious. The investigation is also extended to several new substances, such as hydrocyanic acid, acetic acid, sulphurous acid, alcohol, ammonia and salts of organic bases, without reference to isomorphous relations. It is very necessary to have data which are minute and accurate respecting the diffusion of a considerable variety of substances. This it is my present object to endeavour to supply, leaving speculative deductions in general respecting the nature and laws of liquid diffusion for a future occasion. The density of all the solutions was observed at a constant temperature, namely, 600 FAHR. 806 PROFESSOR GRAHAM ON THE DIFFUSION OF LIQUIDS. 1. Hydrochloric Acid. The period of diffusion arbitrarily chosen for this acid was five days. The diffusate, or quantity of acid diffused, was determined by precipitating the liquid of the external reservoirs with nitrate of silver, and weighing the chloride of silver formed. In the 1 and 2 per cent. solutions, the liquids of two jars were generally mixed and precipitated together. (1.) Hydrochloric acid, 0 99 per cent.; density 1-0043. Diffused at 530.5, in six cells, 7752, 7'52, 7-42 ; mean 7 49 grs. for two cells. Calculated for 1 per cent., 7'56 grs. at 530.5 for two cells, or 7,41 grs. at 510, when corrected for that temperature. (2.) Hydrochloric acid, 192 per cent.; density 1009. Diffused at 51j, in eight cells, 14^71, 14*05,7 14-54, 14 47; mean 14*44 grs. for two cells. Calculated for 2 per cent., 15 04 grs. at 510 for two cells. (3.) Hydrochloric acid, 1993 per cent.; density 10094. Diffused at 62 8, in six cells, two experiments on one-sixth part of the mixed jars gave 8 203, 8,198; mean 8-20 grs. for one cell, or 16-40 grs. for two cells. Calculated for 2 per cent., 16-46 grs. at 620.8 for two cells. (4.) Hydrochloric acid, 3-90 per cent.; density 10190. Diffused at 51, in eight cells, 29-18, 30170, 30 70, 29,26; mean 29,96 grs. for two cells. Calculated for 4 per cent., 30,72 grs. at 51 for two cells. (5.) Hydrochloric acid, 7*90 per cent.; density 103S0. Diffused at 5 ], in four cells, 32-71, 33#64, 33.64, 33174,; mean 33*43 grs. for one cell. Calculated for 8 per cent., 33.84 grs. at 51? for one cell. Comparing the diffusibilities of the 2 per cent. solutions (2 and 3) at 510 and 620.8, an increase is observed from 15,04 to 16,40 grs., or from 100 to 109-1, which gives an increase of 0-77 per cent. for 10. This method of estimating the effect of temperature is not exact, as the times only in which an equal diffusion at the different temperatures takes place are truly comparable. We may deduce from it, however, the effect of the small difference of temperature of 2? 5 of the 1 per cent. solution from the others, as has begn done, without sensible error. The diffusates at the same temperature would then be as follows: Diffusion of Hydrochloric Acid in five days at 510 FAHR.; two cells. Grs. Ratio. From I per cent. solution . . . . 7A41 0'97 From 2 per cent. solution . . . . .15 04 2-00 From 4 per cent. solution . 30-72 4-08 From 8 per cent. solution .6768 9.00 The increasing diffusibility with the larger proportions of acid here observed is unusual, at least in the degree exhibited by the 8 per cent. solution. Other substances, as will be immediately observed of nitric acid, appear to lose proportionally in diffusibility as their solutions are concentrated. PROFESSOR GRAHAM ON THE DIFFUSION OF LIQUIDS. 807 Hydrochloric acid belongs to the most diffusive class of substances known; it appears to exceed hydrate of potash at 530 5, as 7'56 to 6'12, or as 100 to 8009*. The rapidity with which hydrochloric acid diffuses, and the facility with which that substance may be estimated, induced me to examine the progression with which its diffusion takes place with increasing times in a minute manner. The 2 per cent. solution was diffused for times increasing by six hours, from twelve hours or 0,5 day to 4'75 days, six cells being diffused for every period. Instead of determining the acid diffused separately in each jar or pair of jars, the contents of the six jars of each experiment were mixed together, and a definite proportion of the liquid precipitated by nitrate of silver, so as to obtain at once the mean result. Another observation for 5175 days is added, although made at a sensibly higher temperature. Diffusion of Hydrochloric Acid, 2 per cent. solution; one cell. Time. Temperature. Diffusate in grains. Differences. days. 0.5 53-75 0'909 0'75 53'75 1'312 '403 1 53-75 1'766 *454 1'25 53'75 2'353 '587 1'5 53'75 2.596 *243 1-75 53'58 3'178 *5852 2 53.58 3'410 '232 2.25 53.42 3'967 *557 2.5 53'58 4'339 '372 2-75 53'50 4'618 '279 3 53-50 4-969 '351 3*25 53'50 5'304 -335 3.5 54-85 5*857 '553 3-75 54*85 639254 *397 4 54'85 6E407 *153 4.25 54'85 6'795 '388 4.5 54-71 7'034 *239 4'75 54'71 7.473 *339 5.75 56-46 85363 The differences are evidently affected by accidental errors of observation. The diffusion at 3-5 days is also increased by a rise of temperature of more than 1? in that and the following experiments. The diffusion always increases with the time, but less rapidly, according to a gradually diminishing progression. 2. HIdriodic Acid, Hydrobromic Acid and Bromine. Hydriodic Acid.-Time of diffusion five days, as for hydrochloric acid. The acid diffused was estimated from the iodide of silver which it gave when precipitated by nitrate of silver. l ydriodic acid, 1'98 per cent. ; density I'0142. Diffused at 530.5, in eight cells, 14'90, 15e67, 15'25, 15'27; mean 15'27 grs. for two cells. Calculated for 2 per cent., 15'42 grs. at 530.5 for two cells, or 15'11 grs. at 510.* Philosophical Transactions, 1850, p. 39. 808 PROFESSOR GRAHAM ON THE DIFFUSION OF LIQUIDS. These experiments indicate a similarity of diffusion between the two isomorphous substances, hydrochloric and hydriodic acids. Diffusion from 2 per cent. solutions at 510 FAHR. Hydrochloric acid .15-04 100 Hydriodic acid .15,11 100e46 Hydrobromic Acid.-Time of diffusion five days. The diffusate was estimated from the bromide of silver. (1.) Hydrobromic acid, 1P556 per cent.; density 1 01 12. Diffused at 590.7, in eight cells. The whole diffusates mixed together gave by analysis a mean of 12-90 grs. of hydrobromic acid, in two cells; calculated for 2 per cent., 16'58 grs. in two cells, at 590.7 (2.) The experiment was repeated at 590.8, with a solution containing 1578 per cent. of hydrobromic acid, of density 1'0116, with five diffusion phials not employed above. The mean diffusate for a pair of cells was 13"05 grs. of hydrobromic acid ; that is, 16 53 grs. for a 2 per cent. solution, which is as nearly as possible the result of the preceding series of experiments. (3.) Another solution containing exactly 2 per cent. of hydrochloric acid was diffused for comparison in eight cells, in the same circumstances of time and temperathre as (I.) ; its density was 1P0104. Diffusate from 2 per cent. solutions at 590.7 FAHR. Hydrochloric acid .16-55 100 Hydrobromic acid .16-58 10018 Hydrobromic acid appears therefore to coincide in diffusibility with hydrochloric acid at this temperature. It may be remarked that these three acids, hydrochloric, hydrobromic and hydriodic, do not exhibit the same correspondence in another physical property, namely, the densities of their aqueous solutions containing the same proportion of acid. The densities of 2 per cent. solutions of hydrochloric and hydriodic acids appear to be respectively 1'0104 and 1 0143, at 600 FAHR., and that of hydrobromic acid will obviously be an intermediate number. The same acids are also known to differ considerably in the boiling-points of solutions containing the same proportion of acid. A considerable diversity of physical properties appears here to be compatible with equal diffusibility in substances which are isomorphous. Bromine.-Pure water readily dissolves more than 1 per cent. of this substance. The solution prepared, however, contained only 0-864 per cent. of bromine, as was ascertained by treating it with sulphurous acid and afterwards precipitating by nitrate of silver. Its density was 10070. It was evident, from the slow appearance of the brown colour in the exterior cell, that bromine diffuses less rapidly than hydrob romic acid.e PROFESSOR GRAHAM ON THE DIFFUSION OF LIQUIDS. 809 The diffusion-time of bromine was made ten days, or double the time of hydrobromic acid. Two cells contained together a diffusate of 5f80 grs. of bromine; another two cells a diffusate of 5,88 grs.; mean 5,84 grs. at 60? 1 FAHR.; or 6'76 grs. for a I per cent. solution. Doubling the last result we have 13,52 grs. for a 2 per cent. solution, which is still considerably under the diffusate of hydrobromic acid (1 6*58 grs.) in half the time. 3. Hydrocyanic Acid. Time of diffusion five days. The acid diffused was estimated from the cyanide of silver which it gave with nitrate of silver. Hydrocyanic acid, 1*766 per cent., made up to a density of 1,0142 with stulphate of potash. Diffused at 640.2, in six cells, 1140, 11[86, 1 180; mean 11l68 grs. for two cells. Calculated for 2 per cent., 13,23 grs. at 640.2 in two cells, or about 13*10 grs. at 620.8, assuining this acid to be affected in the same way by temperature as hydrochloric acid. Hydrocyanic acid here appears less diffusive than hydrochloric acid, at the same temperature 620.8, as 13,10 to 16'40, or as 79,6 to 100, and not to belong therefore to the same class of diffusive substances. 4. Nitric Acid. Time of diffusion five days. The quantity of this acid diffused was always determined with great exactness by neutralization by means of a normal solution of carbonate of soda. 1. Nitrate of water (HO.NO5), 1 per cent.; density 1-0052. Diffused at 500.8, in eight cells, 6 77, 6 77, 7'26, 6 97; mean 6,94 grs. of nitrate of water in two cells at 500.8, and 6,99 grs. by estimate at 510.2. 2. Nitrate of water, 1 per cent.; density 1*0052. Diffused at 530?5. in six cells, 7 32, 7 32, 7'20; mean 7,28 grs. in two cells. 3. Nitrate of water, 1,92 per cent.; density 1*0112. Diffused at 510.2, in eight cells, 14 34, 14[24, 14,10, 13,96; mean 14,16 grs. in two cells. Calculated for 2 per cent., 14 74 grs. at 510,2 in two cells. 4. Nitrate of water, 2 per cent.; density 1P0106. Diffused at 630.2, in eight cells, 16-97, 16,64, 16 81, 16,64; mean 1676 grs. in two cells. 5. Nitrate of water, 3,88 per cent.; density 1 0209. Diffused at 510,2, in eight cells, 27176, 28*34, 27 90, 27,62; mean 27-90 grs. in two cells. Calculated for 4 per cent., 28-76 grs. at 510.2 in two cells. 6. Nitrate of water, 7#96 per cent.; density 1P0432. Diffused at 5 102, in four cells, 29*17, 29,17, 29,17, 27176; mean 28X82 grs. in one cell. Calculated for 8 per cent., 28,96 grs. at 510.2 in one cell. For the difference of temperature between 510.2 and 630.2, the diffusion rises in the 2 per cent. solution, from 14'74 to 16-76 grs., or from 100 to 113'7; which gives an increase Of 1fl42 per cent. for one degree of temperature. MDcccL. 5 L 810 PROFESSOR GRAHAM ON THE DIFFUSION OF LIQUIDS. The diffusion of the different proportions of this acid at one temperature is as follows: Diffusion of Nitrate of Water in five days at 510.2 ; two cells. Grs. Ratio.

The usual approach to equality of diffusion, between chlorides and nitrates, is ohbservable in hydrochloric and nitric acids, at least in the 1 and 2 per cent. solutions.

PROFESSOR GRAHAM ON THE DIFFUSION OF LIQUIDS. 811 5. Sulphuric Acid. That time of diffusion arbitrarily chosen for this acid was ten days. The diffusate of this acid was determined in the same manner as that of nitric acid. 1. Sulphate of water (HO.S03), 0.993 per cent.; density 10065. Diffused at 5107, in eight cells, 887, 8*87, 8*87, 8869; mean 8'82 grs. of sulphate of water for two cells. Calculated for 1 per cent., 8,91 grs. at 510.7 for two cells, and 8*69 grs. at 490.7. 2. Sulphate of water, 1,89 per cent.; density 1-0130. Diffused at 490.7, in eight cells, 16-13, 16f16, 1 558, 16'03; mean 15,98 grs. for two cells. Calculated for 2 per cent., 16,91 grs. at 490?7 for two cells. 3. Sulphate of water, 2 per cent.; density 1*0 133. Diffused at 630.5, in eight cells, 19 80, 20,05, 19'67, 19,41; mean 19'73 grs. for two cells. 4. Sulphate of water, 3,87 per cent.; density 1 0261. Diffused at 490.7, in eight cells, 32 72, 32-72, 33'06, 32,58; mean 32*77 grs. for two cells. Calculated for 4 per cent., 33 89 grs. at 490.7 for two cells. 5. Sulphate of water, 7 90 per cent.; density 1P0513. Diffused at 490.7, in four cells, 34-08, 34 76, 33 74, 33 63, mean 34 05 grs. for one cell. Calculated for 8 per cent., 34#48 grs. at 490.7 for one cell. In the 2 per cent. solution the diffusion rises, with the difference of temperature between 490.7 and 630.5, from 16,91 to 1973 grs., or from 100 to 116'68. This is an increase of 1 209 per cent. for one degree of temperature. The diffusion of the different proportions of sulphuric acid is as follows: Diffusion of Sulphate of Water in ten days at 490?7; two cells. Grs. Ratio. From 1 per cent. solution . . . . 8,69 1*03 From 2 per cent. solution . . . . 16*91 2 From 4 per cent. solution . 33,89 4*01 From 8 per cent. solution . 68'96 8*16 The diffusibility of different strengths of this acid appears to be pretty uniform, but with a slight tendency to increase in the higher proportions, like hydrochloric acid. Sulphuric acid is greatly inferior in velocity of diffusion to hydrochloric acid, but still appears to possess considerably more than half the diffusibility of the latter. 6. Chromic Acid. Time of diffusion ten days. The diffusates from four cells of the 2 per cent. solution were mixed together, and the quantity of chromic acid diffused for two cells reduced by means of hydrochloric acid and alcohol, and weighed as oxide of chromium. 1 762 per cent. of anhydrous chromic acid, density 1*01404, diffused at 670.3, gave 19178 grs. of chromic acid in two cells. Calculated for 2 per cent., 22*43 grs. of chromic acid, in two cells, at 670.3. The diffusion of sulphuric acid at 6305, was 19173 grs., which would give about 21 grs. of that acid at 670.3. 5 L2 812 PROFESSOR GRAHAM ON THE DIFFUSION OF LIQUIDS. 7. Acetic Acid. Time of diffusion ten days. This acid cannot be determined accurately by the acidimetrical method, owing to the acetates of potash and soda being essentially alkaline to test-paper, like the carbonates of the same bases, although neutral in composition. The weight of carbonate of baryta dissolved by the acid was had recourse to. 1. Acetate of water (HO.C4H303), 2 per cent.; density 10030. Diffused at 480.8, in eight cells, 12-62, 1094 1110, 11*39 grs. of acetate of water; mean 1 P51 grs. for two cells. 2. Acetate of water, 4 per cent.; density 1 0060. Diffused at 480.8, in eight cells, 22,12, 21'71, 21V59, 22-67; mean 22 02 grs. for two cells. 3. Acetate of water, 8 per cent.; density 101 17. Diffused at 480.8, in four cells, 21,19, 2013, 21 84, 20144 ; mean 20*90 grs. for one cell. The diffusion of the different proportions of acetic acid is as follows:Diffusion of Acetate of Water in ten days at 48?8; two cells. Grs. Ratio. From 2 per cent. solution .11.31 2 From 4 per cent. solution .2202 3,83 From 8 per cent. solution .4180 7-26 The diffusibility diminishes with the larger proportions of acid. This acid appears to be considerably less diffusive than sulphuric acid. I was led to over-estimate the diffusion of acetic acid in a preliminary observation of my former paper, by trusting to the acidimetrical method of determination. Hydrochloric acid appears to diffuse about two and a half times more rapidly than acetate of water, at the same temperature. 8. Sulphurous Acid. The time of diffusion chosen for this acid was ten days, for comparison with sulphuric acid. The usual number of eight cells of the I and 2 per cent. solutions were diffused, and four cells of the 4 and 8 per cent. solutions. The whole diffusates of each proportion were then mixed together, and the proportional quantity of liquid representing two cells in the 1 and 2 per cent. solutions, and 1 cell in the 4 and 8, was converted into stulphuric acid by a slight excess of bromine, and determined from the sulphate of baryta. 1. 0-982 per cent. of sulphurous acid, density l10056, diffused at 6801, gave 7 94 grs. in two cells. Calculated for 1 per cent., 8-09 grs. of sulphurous acid in two cells at 680.1. 2. 1 965 per cent. of sulphurous acid, density 10 1055, diffused at 68?.1, gave 16,66 grs. for two cells. Calculated for 2 per cent., 16'96 grs. of sulphurous acid in two cells at 680.1. 3. 3~93 per cent. of sullphurous acid, density l-01991, diffused at 680.1, gave PROFESSOR GRAHAM ON THE DIFFUSION OF LIQUIDS. 813 16,21 grs. for one cell. Calculated for 4 per cent., 16*50 grs. of sulphurous acid in one cell at 68?1. 4. 7*86 per cent. of sulphurous acid, density l0384, diffused at 680.1, gave 32,60 grs. for one cell. Calculated for 8 per cent., 33,19 grs. of sulphurous acid in one cell at 68? 1. Diffusion of Sulphurous Acid in ten days at 680. 1; two cells. Grs. Ratio. From 1 per cent. solution . . . 8109 O0954 From 2 per cent. solution . . . 16,96 2 From 4 per cent. solution . . . 3300 3,891 From 8 Der cent. solution . . . 6638 7-827 This substance appears to be less diffusive than stulphuric acid at the same temnperature; the diffusion of sulphurous acid at 680.1 considerably resembles that of sulphuric acid at 4907 (p. 811). 9. Ammonia. The time of diffusion chosen was 4*041 days, or that of hydrate of potash with chloride of sodium at seven days. The usual number of eight cells of the I and 2 per cent. solutions were diffused, and four cells of the 4 and 8 per cent. solutions. The whole diffusates of each proportion were then mixed together, and the quantity of ammonia diffused for two cells determined by an alkalimetrical experiment, which was always repeated twice. It was necessary for diffusion to have the ammoniacal solution made denser than water, which was effected by the addition of common salt. 1. 1 005 per cent. of ammonia, density made up to 100352 with chloride of sodium, diffused at 630.4, gave 4,96 grs. for two cells; calculated for 1 per cent., 4.93 grs. of ammonia in two cells at 630.4. 2. 201 per cent. of ammonia, density made up to 100617 with chloride of sodium, diffused at 630.4, gave 9-64 grs. for two cells; calculated for 2 per cent., 9 59 grs. of ammonia in two cells at 630.4. 3. 4-02 per cent. of ammonia, density made up to 101 141 with chloride of sodium, diffused at 630.4, gave 9'91 grs. for one cell; calculated for 4 per cent., 9*86 grs. of ammonia, in one cell, at 630.4. 4. 8#04 per cent. of ammonia, density made up to 10215 with chloride of sodium, diffused at 63?4, gave 2071 grs. for one cell; calculated for 8 per cent., 20'61 grs. of ammonia in one cell at 63N4. Diffusion of Ammonia in 4 04 days at 630.4; two cells. Grs. Ratio. From 1 per cent. solution . . . 4.93 1*029 From 2 per cent. solution . . . 9.59 2 From 4 per cent. solution . . . 19172 4*l17 From 8per cent.solution . . . 41-22 8*6O5 814 PROFESSOR GRAHAM ON THE DIFFUSION OF LIQUIDS. Ammonia appears to have a diffusibility approaching to that of hydrate of potash. It appears somewhat less diffusive than hydrocyanic acid at the same temperature, in the proportion of 12 to 13 nearly; or to possess about three-fourths of the diffusibility of hydrochloric acid. 10. Alcohol. Time of diffusion ten days. The quantity of alcohol diffused was determined by careful distillation. 1. Alcohol, 2 per cent. ; density made up to 1*0237 with chloride of sodium. Diffused at 400-7, in eight cells, 17-80, 16*70; -mean 17*25 grs. for four cells, or 8,62 grs. for two cells. 2. Alcohol, 4 per cent.; density made up to 1#0203 with chloride of sodium. Diffused at 48? 7, in eight cells, 34130, 30#20; mean 32'25 grs. for four cells, or 16 12 grs. for two cells. 3. Alcohol, 8 percent.; density made up to 10154 with chloride of sodium. Diffused at 48? 7, in four cells, 30*80, 40 2;, mean 35 50 grs. for two cells, or 17-75 grs. for one cell. The results accord less closely with each other than usual, owing, I believe, chiefly to the difficulties of manipulation when the density of the liquid placed in the phials to be diffused approaches so nearly to that of water. This is more particularly true of the 8 per cent. solution. Diffusion of Alcohol in ten days at 48? 7; two cells.

Alcohol does not appear to belong to the same class of diffusive substances as acetic acid, which -might be expected from their similarity of composition, but possesses a considerably lower diffusibility.

Alcohol may be substituted for water to dissolve certain salts, and also as an atmosphere into which these salts may diffuse. From experiments which have been commenced on this subject, it appears that the diffusion of hydrate of potash, iodide of potassium, chloride of calcium and others is about four times slower into alcohol of density 0'840 than into water. The salts likewise often exhibit the same relax.

Time of diffusion 1 l43 days*. The salt diffused was precipitated by sulphuric acid, and calculated from the weight of the sulphate of baryta formed. 1. Nitrate of baryta, 1 per cent.; density 1,0083. Diffused at 51? 5, in eight cells, 6 71, 6-71, 684) 6 68; mean 6'73 grs. for two cells. 2. Nitrate of baryta, 0 993 per cent.; density 1,00886.

Nitrate of Lime. Time of diffusion 11P43 days. The diffusate was evaporated to dryness with an excess of sulphuric acid, and the nitrate of lime, which is always supposed anhydrous, was estimated from the sulphate of lime produced. 1.

By a rise of temperature from 510.5 to 640 1, the diffusion of the 1 per cent. solution increases from 6-54 to 7 66 grs., or from 100 to 1 17'1 ; which is an increase of 1 357 per cent. for 1?.

Acetate of Lead. Diffused for 16,166 days; the time chosen before for sulphate of magnesia, with seven days for chloride of sodium. The solution contained 0-965 per cent. of anhydrous salt, with the density 1-0080. As this solution of acetate of lead was found to be precipitated by pure water, about 2 per cent. of strong acetic acid was introduced into the solution, and the same acid was added in a less proportion to the water jars. The salt of lead diffused was afterwards determined by means of sulphuric acid. Diffused in eight cells, at 530.1, 7 45, 7-29, 7-46 and 8*07 grs.; mean 7'56; or 7-84 for 1 per cent. in two cells.

The same addition of acetic acid was made to it as to the preceding acetate of lead, in order that the circumstances of diffusion might be similar for both salts. The salt diffused was estimated also in the form of sulphate. Diffused at 530.5, in eight cells, 7 30, 7 38, 7 40 and 7 21 grs. in two cells; mnean 733; or 7,50 for I per cent. in two cells.

Diffused at 500.9, in eight cells, 7-91, 7-27, 7A42, 7'12; mean 7'43 grs. of chloride of barium for two cells; calculated for I per cent., 7'50 grs. at 50? 9 for two cells. The diffusion of this salt being manifestly more rapid than that of the chloride of calcium, a shorter time was tried, which is to seven days, the time of chloride of sodium, as the square root of 3 to the square root of 4.5. Time of diffusion 8'57 davs. 2. Chloride of barium, 1'01 per cent.; density 10095.

We appear then to have a small but constant difference of PROFESSOR GRAHAM ON THE DIFFUSION OF LIQUIDS. 819 about 3per cent. in the diffusion of these two isomorphous salts, the chloride of barium, which possesses the highest atomic weight, having the advantage. The diffusion of the 1 per cent. solution of the same salts for the longer period of 1 143 days, gives 7 50 for chloride of barium at 50'09, and 7?y52 for chloride of strontiumI at 510, or nearly the same temperature. For the first time we have in the barytic salts a divergence between chlorides and nitrates, for the nitrates of the samne bases have a number about 68 only at the same temperature. I am led however to believe that this discrepancy becomes much less at low temperatures by experiments which are at present in progress. 18. Chloride of Calcium. Time of diffusion 1 1-43 days. The salt diffused was weighed as suilphate of lime. 1. Chloride of calcium, 1'065 per cent.; density 1P0091.

The diffusion of the I per cent. solution of chloride of calcium is increased by a rise of temperature from 5009 to 63?08, from 6,51 to 7,92, or from 100 to 1216, which is an increase of 1 674 per cent. for 10* Diffusion of Chloride of Calcium in 1 143 days at 630.8;S two cells.

The nitrate in both cases falls off, while the chloride sustains throughout the high diffusibility of the lower proportions. 19. Chloride of Manganese. Trime of diffusion 11 -43 days. The salt diffused was estimated by means of nitrate of silver. The 1 per cent. solution, of density 1,0085, gave at 500.8, in eight cells, 6,67, 6 26, 679 and 6-81 grs.; mean 6,63 for two cells. 20. Nitrate of Magnesia. Time of diffusion 1 1>43 days. The salt diffused was estimated as sulphate. The 1 per cent. solution, of density 1-0073, gave at 50? 8, in eight cells 6-29, 639, 6152 and 6'76 grs.; mean 6,49 for two cells. 21. Nitrate of Copper. Time of diffusion 11.43 days. The salt diffused was estimated from the oxide of copper obtained by ignition. The 1 per cent. solution, of density 1V0075, in eight cells, at 500.8, gave 6,52, 6,36, 6,18 and 6170 grs.; mean 6,44 for two cells. Comparing the preceding salts with chloride of calcium diffused at the same temperature, 500.8, we have the following results:Chloride of calcium. 651 100 Chloride of manganese. 663 101 85 Nitrate of magnesia. 649 99,69 Nitrate of copper.. 6-44 98'92 This group of salts, belonging to the same isomorphous family of bases, the magnesian, again correspond closely in diffusibility.

Protochloride of Iron. A solution of this salt of 1P023 per cent. was diffused at 530.5, a somewhat higher temperature than the corresponding chlorides. It gave 6,45, 6*48, 6A48 and 6(28 grs. in two cells; mean 644, or 6*30 for I per cent. in two cells. This salt appears therefore to belong to the last group. 26. Sesquichloride of Iron. A full series of observations was made upon the diffusion of the different pr'opor.. tions of this salt from 1 to 8 per cent., but in all of them decomposition was determined by the diffusion, with turbidity also in the solution phial except in the 8 per cent. solution. The wean diffusion from the 1 per cent. solution in 11.43 days, at 63? :3, was 4.13 grs. of sesquichloride of iron with 128 gr. of free hydrochloric acid, in two cells. This result indicates that one-half nearly of the sesquichloride of iron is decomposed in the diffusion. The mean diffusion from the 8 per cent. solution, at 630.3, was 55,88 grs. of sesquichloride of iron, with 6-66 grs. of free hydrochloric acid, in two cells. It appears from this experiment that perchloride of iron approaches the chloride of calcium in diffusibility. That the protoand persalts of the mtivgnesian mnetals should have a similar rate of diffusion, is not unlikely from other analogies which they exhibit. 27. Sulphate of Magnesia. The time chosen for the diffusion of this salt, namely, 16 166 days, is a multiple by 2 of the time of sulphate of potash, and by 4 of the time of hydrate of potash. The diffusate was evaporated to dryness and weighed. 822 PROFESSOR GRAHAM ON THE DIFFUSION OF LIQUIDS. 1. 1*012 per cent. of anhydrous sulphate of magnesia, density 1-0108, diffused cat 650.4, in eight cells, 7 34, 7 66, 7 43, 7'18; mean 7 40 grs. for two cells; calculated for 1 per cent., 7*31 grs. of sulphate of magnesia in two cells at 650.4. 2. 2,024 per cent. of sulphate of magnesia, density 1l02089, diffused at 650 4, in eight cells, 12 91, 13,13, 12 83, 12,93; mean 12'95 grs. for two cells; calculated for 2 per cent., 12'79 grs. of sulphate of magnesia in two cells at 65?A. 3. 4,048 per cent. of sulphate of magnesia, density 1P04033, diffused at 650.4, in four cells, 12x06, 12x56, 10635 12-24 ; mean 1 P87 grs. for one cell; calculated for 4 per cent., 1 173 grs. of sulphate of magnesia in one cell at 65?A4. 4. 8-096 per cent. of lsulphate of magnesia, density P07830, diffused at 650.4, in four cells, 22-25, 20-56, 21P80, 22,06; mean 21P67 grs. for one cell; calculated for 8 per cent., 2141 grs. of sulphate of magnesia in one cell at 650.4. 5. 8'07 per cent. of sulphate of magnesia, density P07830, diffused at 620 8, in fonur cells, 21*12, 21,20, 22'13, 21177; mean 2l155 grs. for one cell; calculated for 8 per cent., 2133 grs. of sulphate of magnesia in one cell at 620.8. 6. 16-14 per cent. of sulphate of magnesia, density 1-15054, diffused at 620.8, in four cells, 37,08, 38 39, 38,65, 37 50; mean 37-90 grs. for one cell; calculated for 16 per cent., 37'53 grs. of sulphate of magnesia in one cell at 620.8. 7. 24 22 per cent. of sulphate of magnesia, density 1P21882, diffused at 620.8, in four cells, 49 38, 50 40, 53 36, 5300; meani 5153 grs. for one cell ; calculated for 24 per cent., 5102 grs. of sulphate of magnesia in one cell at 620.8.

This I have no doubt, however, is an accidental error, the disturbances from changes of temperature and other causes of dispersion being in direct proportion to the duration of the experiment, and therefore much increased with these long times; while the 1 per cent. solution also appears to be generally the proportion most exposed to such errors. The sulphate of zinc appears to be the truest throughout, in its diffusion, of these two salts. The approach to equality becomes close in the 4 per cent. and larger proportions of salt, particularly with the unusually high proportions of 16 and 24 per cent., which were observed in these salts. The diffuision of both salts falls off remarkably in the higher proportions. The result of the comparison of these two magnesian sulphates is no doubt favourable to the similarity of diffusion of isomorphous salts. 824 PROFESSOR GRAHAM ON THE DIFFUSION OF LIQUIDS. 29. Sulphate of Alumina. The time of difftision chosen was 16 166 days, or the same as that for sulphate of magnesia. The usual number of eight cells of the I and 2 per cent. solutions were diffused, and four cells of the 4 and 8 per cent. solutions. The whole diffusates of each proportion were then mixed together and the quantities of alumina and sulphuric acid, diffused for two cells, determined separately. 1. 11045 pet cent. of sulphate of alumina, density 1101160, diffused at 650A4, gave 1-80 gr. of alumina and 3'93 grs. of sulphuric acid, in all 5173 grs. for two cells.

A rise of temperature from 530 to 630.4 increases the diffusibility of nitrate of soda from 10 81 to 12,35, or from 100 to 114,3, which is an increase of 1*37 per cent. for 1?. The increase on the nitrate of silver for the same rise of temperature appeared to be considerably greater, namely, 2,04 per cent. for 10.

A certain deviation from this ratio of the times of equal diffusion, appears on comparing the experimental results obtained at present for these salts. 5 N2 828 PROFESSOR GRAHAM ON THE DIFFUSION OF LIQUIDS.

But chloride of potassium corresponds more closely with nitrate of silver than with chloride of sodium and nitrate of soda, at the temperature of the experiments.

It might thus be supposed that the nitrate of silver followed the sodium rate more accurately than the nitrate of soda and chloride of sodium themselves do. A series of observations were made upon the diffusion of the 1 per cent. solution of chloride of potassium at a nearly constant temperature of 560, but for different times, varying from five days to eight days, and eighteen hours, to discover the progression, which proved to be pretty similar to that of the 2 per cent. solution of hydrochloric acid. Six cells were diffused for each period, of which the mean result is given: the times advance by ten hours.

The squares of these times of equal diffusion are as 1 to 2 04 for the shortest period of the chloride of potassium, and as I to 2*10 for the longest period but one. The variation in the differences towards the middle of the Table is too great to be explained, except I fear by some error of observation, although no ordinary precaution was neglected in the execution of this laborious series of experiments. 34. Iodides and Bromides of Potassium and Sodium. Iodide of Potassium.-Time of diffusion 5'716 days. The diffusate was estimated by means of nitrate of silver. (1.)

For comparison, a solution of chloride of potassium, containing exactly 2 per cent. of salt and having the density 1P0133, was diffused in the same circumstances of time and temperature as the two preceding salts. The mean diffusate of eight cells was 12 24 grs. for two cells. Hence the following result of the diffusion of three isomorphous salts Diffusion of 2 per cent. solutions in 51716 days, at 590.8. Grs.

Bromide of Sodium.-Time of diffusion and temperature as above. A solution of 2,146 per cent., of density 1'01726, diffused in eight cells, gave a mean diffusate of 12'80 grs.; that is, 11,93 grs. for 2 pet cent. A comparative experiment was made with a solution of chloride of sodium, containing 1'917 per cent. of salt and of density 1,01376, in eight cells, at 600. The diffusates for four pairs of cells were 1 P65, 1 1'75, 11-63 and 1 1,47 grs.; mean 1 1,63 grs., which gives by proportion 12-14 grs. for a 2 per cent. solution. As the present salt differs only 00.2 FAHR. in diffusion-temperature from the two preceding salts, which is inadequate to produce an assignable difference of diffusion, the three salts may be supposed to be diffused at the samne temperature, without sensible error.

Chloride of Ammonium. Time of diffusion 51716 days. The salt diffused was estimated by means of nitrate of silver. Solution 0 988 per cent.; density 1,0036. Diffused at 530, in eight cells, 6-09, 6-07, 5'67, 5-87; mean 5,92 grs., and 5P99 for one per cent. in two cells. This is somewhat more than 5,68, one-half of the diffusate of the 2 per cent. solution of iodide of potassium, at nearly the same temperature. The diffusion, however, of the small proportions of salts of ammonium, such as the 1 per cent. solution, is apt to be given in excess, from their low density. 36. Dichloride of Copper. Time of diffusion seven days, or that of chloride of sodium. The salt diffused was obtained by evaporation to dryness, in an air-bath, after treating the liquid with an excess of chlorine, in the form of chloride, from which the dichloride was calculated. It was an object of interest to discover whether the dichloride of copper (Cu2 Cl), which should be isomorplhous with the chloride of sodium, may separate from the protochloride of copper and other magnesian salts, and assume the high diffusibility of the salts of alkaline metals. But the salt in question is entirely insoluble in water. A solution, however, was obtained by dissolving an equivalent quantity of the red suboxide of copper recently precipitated, in hydrochloric acid, of density 1,033, so as to give one grain of dichloride in every hundred water-grain measures of the solution. This acid solution did not precipitate by dilution with water. The salt was diffused into pure water at a mean temperature of 530.2, 1. Dichloride of copper diffused, 6'66, 6 57, 7 01 and 6,48 grs.; mean 6,68 grs. in two cells. Chloride of sodium at 530.4, nearly the same temperature, gave 5-90 grs. in the same time. Reducing the result to the temperature of 510 by an approximati"Ve correction, we should have 6'48 grs. of dichloride of copper for that temperature, at which chloride of calcium gave 6-51 grs. in 11.43 days, and protochloride of copper (Cu Cl) 6-06 grs. at nearly the same temperature, also in 1 1*43 days. So far as we can judge from an experiment at a single temperature, it would appear that the diffusion of dichloride of copper is more rapid than that of the chloride (Cu Cl), in a proportion which supposes the former compound to possess half tile 4" solution-density" of the latter, the times of equal diffusion 7 and 1 1P43 days, being when squared as 1 to 2. With the view of discovering whether the large proportion of hydrochloric acid, amounting to 7 per cent., present in the preceding solution of dichloride of copper, modified the diffusion of the salt, a portion of the same acid solution was treated with chlorine gas, to convert the copper salt into chloride, and diffused into water, after 832 PROFESSOR GRAHAM ON THE DIFFUSION OF LIQUIDS. the excess of chlorine was removed by agitation of the solution with air. The proportion of salt present was thus increased in weight from 1 to 1*36 per cent. The time of diffusion was 11.43 days, and the temperature 53?. 2. Chloride of copper diffused from a 1P36 per cent. solution of the salt in hydrochloric acid, 5.83, 5 66, and 5 30 grs. in two cells; mean 5-60 grs. The corresponding diffusion from a 1 per cent. solution may be supposed to be less than 566 grs., in the proportion of 1-36 to 1, without any great error. The results thus become chloride of copper diffused, 3-98, 385 and 3#58 grs.; mean 3 80 grs. in two cells. It hence appears that the diffusion of chloride of copper is much diminished by the presence of a great excess of hydrochloric acid in the same solution. Different causes suggest themselves for this result, such as the possibility of a combination existing of chloride of copper with chloride of hydrogen, in the acid solution; or the influence which must be admitted of the more soluble substance, in a mixture of two similar substances, in repressing the diffusion of the less soluble. The present result, however, is entirely opposed to theidea that the higlhdiffusibility of the dichloride of copper, observed before, is due to the hydrochloric acid present. 3. The diffusion of chloride of sodium also appears to be repressed by contact with. a large excess of hydrochloric acid. One per cent. of chloride of sodium raised the density of dilute hydrochloric acid from 1P035 to 1i0408. Diffused into pure water for seven days at 520.9, in eight cells, the diffusates of chloride of sodium were 3 80, 3'87, 4 00 and 3,86 grs.; mean 3#88 for two cells. The diffusion of chloride of sodium is thus reduced in a corresponding measure with that of chloride of copper by association with seven times its weight of hydrochloric acid. These results are interesting in a very different point of view. I have always watched tor the appearance of some absorbent or imbibing power on the part of the acids, more analogous to an endosmotic attraction for water, as usually conceived. If such an attraction existed, it would complicate the phenomena. of diffusion, for the volume of water absorbed by the acid would displace and project a portion of the latter into the reservoir, the phial not being extensible. The high diffusibility of hydrochloric and nitric acids would be thus explained. But by such a mechanical displacement the chloride of sodium would be thrown out in the preceding experiment, as well as the hydrochloric acid, which is not the case. 4. Even in hydrochloric acid of density 1,124 (25 per cent.), the diffusion of 1 per cent. of chloride of sodium for seven days, at 5606, was found to amount to 4-7 grs. only in two cells, and is less than from a solution in pure water. 5. In comparing the influence of nitric acid with that of hydrochloric acid upon the diffusion of chloride of sodium, it was found that in a 7 pet cent. solution of nitric acid, the chloride of sodium (1 per cent.) was entirely decomposed in the diffusive process, at 560.6, and gave hydrochloric acid in the full diffusive equivalent of that Acid, together with nitrate of soda.

The water of the jars was partially charged with carbonic acid gas, to prevent the decomposition of this and the other bicarbonates in the act of diffusion. The usual number of eight cells of the 1 and 2 per cent. solutions were diffused, and four cells of the 4 and 8 per cent. solutions. The whole diffusates of each proportion were then mixed together, and the quantity of bicarbonate of potash diffused for two cells, converted into the chloride of potassium, evaporated to dryness and weighed. 1. 1059 per cent. of bicarbonate of potash (HO .

The results for the three bicarbonates may be stated as follows, the diffusate of the 2 per cent. solution of bicarbonate of potash being made equal to 200, as a standard of comparison.

The times chosen for these two bicarbonates is to that of the bicarbonate of soda, as the square root of 2 to the square root of 3, and the remarkable agreement observed in the diffusion of these salts gives support therefore to that relation. In alluding to this relation, however, it is proper to add that the carbonates of potash and soda deviate from it in a sensible degree, and the hydrates of potash and soda very considerably. If the relation therefore has a real foundation, it must be masked in the salts last named by differences existing between them in certain properties, the discovery and investigation of which is of the last importance for the theory of liquid diffusion. 40. lydrochllorate of Morphine. Time of diffusion 1143 days. The crystallized salt was assumed to be of the composition C34 HISN06 . HC1+ 6HO, with the equivalent 374-5.

The quantities refer to anhydrous salt, and were estimated from the chlorine, as with hydrochlorate of morphine. These two analogous salts appear to approach very closely in diffusibility.

Hydrochlorate of morphine . . . . 1 160 100 Hydrochlorate of strychnine . . . . 1 1 49 99 05 For a similar period of 11,43 days, but at a lower temperature, 530.4, the 1 per cent. solution of hydrochlorate of morphine gave a mean result of 5 49 grs. from two cells, and the hydrochlorate of strychnine 5177 grs. from two cells. But the weights of chloride of silver from which these numbers are deduced were too small to admit of much precision. The diffusion of these salts of organic bases in 11-43 days, is exceeded by the diffusion of chloride of ammonium or potassium in 5-71 days, or half the former time. The vegeto-alkalies appear thus to be divided from ammonia and potash. The new observations of the present paper are favourable to the existence of a relation amounting to close similarity or equality in diffusibility between certain classes of substances. The chlorides and nitrates of the same metal generally exhibit this corespondence, as in the chloride of calcium and nitrate of lime, the chloride of sodium andG nitrate of soda, and also in hydrochloric and nitric acids. Isomorphous salts exhibit the same relation, as has been observed in the chlorides, bromides and iodides of potassium, sodium and, hydrogen, in various salts of baryta, strontia and lead, in numerous magnesian salts in the salts of silver, soda, and probably those of suboxide of copper, and in several additional salts of potash and ammonia. Corresponding salts of two of the vegeto-alkalies are also found to be equidiffusive. Before discussing the relations between the different groups of equidiffusive substances which are thus formed, it will be necessary to examine their diffusion at widely different temperatures, a subject attended with considerable difficulty.
