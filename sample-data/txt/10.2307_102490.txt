Account of a Monstrous Calf with Two Heads.Communicated by the Right Honourable, Sir Robert Southwell, V. P. R. S. A Cow of Mr. Arthur Dabs's, a substantial Freeholder of Wilnecot, in the County of Warwick, did on Monday the 11th of January, 1697/8. bring forth a Monstrous Calf, having one perfect large Head, and on the Right Side of that, grew another almost as large, and and of true Shape, having both Tongue and Teeth; and from the Roof of the Mouth of the Monstrous Head, hung down a Piece of Flesh with the Shape of a Tongue upon it, and a Row of Teeth, as on an under Jaw, which occasioned the Man who shew'd it, to say, it had Three Mouths. It had to each Head Two Eyes, only those of the Monstrous were very small, and I believe had no Sight. It had only Two Ears to both Heads, one of N 2 which (80) which was placed on the far Side of the Monstrous Head, the other as usual in other Calfs. It breathed equally at both Mouths, and had Communication with the same Throat, but took its Nourishment only at the perfect Mouth: The under Jaw of the other being so weak, that the Mouth always stood open and drivell'd. It appeared on the Left side to be a perfect Calf, and look'd very lively, and was, at Three Days Old, as large and strong as other Calfs usually are at Ten Days or a Fortnight. IV.
