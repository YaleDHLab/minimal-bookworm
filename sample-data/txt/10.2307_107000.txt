To which is added a Postscript, containing an Improvenesit of Mr. Emerson s Comnputation of the same Logarithm. By the Rev. John HeJlins, Vicar-of Potter's Pury, in Northamptonshire, Communicated by Nevil Maskelyne, D.D. F. B. S, and Astronomner Rloyal. Peald February 18, 1796. I. TrHE method o" computing by series is so extensive and useful a part iof t1ne mathematics, that any device which fcinlitates the operation by them will undoubtedly be acceptable to those whoare-proper judges of these matters. In this persuasion, I have employed an hour of that little leisure which my present situation affords me, in improving a calculation of NAPIER'S, for finding the hyperbolic logarithm of 1o, which, was given by the justly celebrated WILLIAM JONES, Esq. F. R. S. in p. 18o of his Synopsis Palrmrioruin f1at heseos. The same comnputation, described in a manner better suited to the capacities of beginners, was also published many years afterward by the learned Dr. SAUNDERSON, in the second volume of his Elements of Algebra, p. 633 and 634. Since Dr. S-AUNDERSON'S time the doctrine of series has been much improved. My present intention is, to exhibit a transformation of the series by which Mr. JONES computed the hyperbolic logarithm of lo i36 Meer. HELLINS'S Inprovenment in the Computation to others, the terms of which decrease by the powers of 8o; so that their convergency is swift, and the divisions by 8o are easily made. 2. Mr. JONES considered the number lo as composed of 2 X 2 X 2X and consequently obtained the logarithm of lo by adding three times the logarithm of 2 to the logarithm of T. The algebraic series which he used on this occasion was zd zd3ds 5 z7 d S + ? 5 + 757, &c. and the numerical value of wvas for the logarithm of 2, and for the logarithm of Aso that he has F ~~ ~~~6 6 6 6 363 2363 + + 7, &C.

And if the first, third, fifth, &c. term of this series be written in one line, and the second, fourth, sixth, &c. in another, we shall have 59+ 9.94 +39&c. + X 9?7 ? + + 7 &c lo 2 X ~~~3 9 7 .93 1 X T.95 + 15X97 which two series are evidently F 2xTIC 1 +y 581 + 981+ I3 813&-+~~~~~~~~ it 9 3 ~~~+ 7s+ -11.81" + 158 813, 1&c And Mr. JoNES'S other series, -9 + + 529 + .97, &c. 9 )e e -3.9 5 95 7.96c 9 3.9 5.94 7.9 of the Hyperbolic Logarithm of to. 137 X: 1 +-3?--?-+ Y813,&C.

Now, by comparing the three series at the end of the last article with the general series here given, we shall find that, in the first and last of these series, the value of m is i, and in the second of them it is i. The value of n in the first and* See Phil. Trans. for 1794, Part 2d. p. 2i8, where this matter is more fully explained.MDCCXCVI. T i38 Mr. HELLINS'S Improvement in the Computation second series is 4, and in the third it is 2. The values of a are obviously 2 in the first series, and 1in the secon& and third. But in each of them z, = -_g is =181 These values of the letters being written for them in the second general form, we have three new series, viz. 2.8I 4A 8B I1C i6D So ~8o+ ,&c. 8o 5-80 9.80 13.80 17.80' and z.S S1.A 9B 12C i6D &C a 9.380 -780 +ix8 Is8 + 19.80' &c. 2.8i 7A413 6C SD and s: 80+ 5o780+ 98 &C. 9.80 3. 80 S.0S 7.80 9.80 which three series are equal in value to those in art. I, and to the hyperbolic logarithm of io. 5. With respect to the convergency of these new series, it is evidently somewhat swifter than by the powers of 8o. For even in the first series, which has the slowest convergency of the three, the coefficients 4z, T3 &c. are each of them less than 1. 6. But another advantage of these new series is, that their numerators and denominators may be reduced to simpler terms, in consequence of which the arithmetical operation by them is further facilitated. In the first and second series, every term after the first is divisible by 4; and every termn in the third series admits of a similar reduction by the number 2. The three series then, when these reductions are made, and their first terms are also abbreviated, will stand as below, (each still converging somewhat faster than by the powers of 8o); and we shall have the hyperbolic logarithm of. I0 of the Hyperbolic Logarithm of io. ,9 F1 A 2B 3C 4D = 3 A z B 3C + 4D ~~~ ~+ &C. 41 7A20 1IB20 15.20 19.20 ' 9 A + 2B 3C +D &C.

The new series then, still converging somewhat quicker than by the powers of 8o, may stand thus: 81 A B 3C 2D _. _= .+ &C. 40 5.20 9.10 13.20 17.10' A ~ ~~+zD and I ..... .A + B3C + D &C. 40 7.20 11.10 15.20 I9.10 and 9 _ + L _ + D &C 40 3-40 5.20 7.40 9.10 & And even yet one might still facilitate the computation of the value of some of the terms. Thus, is = is =' -, -is = and . is = ' &c. 10 40 8 IS.20 100 By these expedients the sum of the three new series, which is equal to the hyperbolic logarithm of lo, may quickly be found. 140 Mr. HELLINS'S Improvement in the Computation P. S. Containing an Improvement of Mr. EMERSON'S Computation of the Hyperbolic Logarithm of 10. 7. Since the above paper was written, on looking into EMERSON'S Fluxions, I have found, at p. 137 of the first edition,* another computation of the hyperbolic logarithm of lo, which is preferable to Mr. JONES'S, on account of the swifter convergency of one of the series used in it, as will appear presently. These series also admit of a transformation to others, by which the constant divisors 81 and 64009, used by Mr. EMERSON, are exchanged for 40 and 32000, while nearly the same rate of convergency is retained; which is another remarkable instance of the utility of transformations of this kind. Mr. EMERSON, considering the number lo as composed of 5'0 X 230 510 102 sin 4'0X I =s,0 x 0 ,and using the same algebraic series as Mr. JONES used on this occasion, finds the hyperbolic logarithm of io to be-= -o L. of -L + A L. of '024e _ 20+320 + .01 20 &c _ it 9 + 320-81 + 5.9 + 7.9.813C + S + IS.9 + 1S9.17 + 1 8.93 &C. +53 3.25 3.64009 5.253.640091 77253.640093''where, instead of a series converging by the powers of t,? as in Mr. JONES'S calculation, we have that which converges by the powers of 6409'9 c or above four times as swiftly. But what renders this very swiftly converging series still more useful is, that it admits of a transformation, by the theorem in article 4, * See also page 197 of 3d edition. t See article 3. of the Hyperbolic Logarithm of 10. 141 to another series which converges by the powers of 9 64ooo~ by which the numerical calculation is greatly facilitated. 8. For the two series in the preceding article (the sum of which is H. L. of lo), are evidently = -9x 1 + 381 + 5.81 + 78 &C. and 2 x: 1 + 9 + +9 &C. 25 3 3609 5.640091 7.64oo93 ' And these two series, when transformed by the theorem abovementioned, and the terms abbreviated, become 9 A zB 3C + 4 & 4 3.40 5.40 7.40 9.40 and 9.253 _ A + .93 + 49D &C. 32ooo 3.32000 5 .32000. 7.32000 9.32000 Which series admit of some other abbreviations similar to those pointed out in article 6; and by them may the hyperbolic logarithm of io be very easily and expeditiously computed.
