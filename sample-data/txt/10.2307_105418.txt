LXXII. An Account of a late Discovery of Asbestos in France: In a Letter to the Rev. Tho. Birch, D. D. Secretary to the Royal Society, from Mr. Turberville Needham, F. R. S. Reverend Sir, I Have little to add in the way of literature, except a singular discovery accidentally made, lately, in one of the French provinces, of the nature of the asbestos, or amianthus.

Does not this, with the discovery of lava, pummice-stones, iron in a perfect state, and, in fine, many other traces of fire observed in most of the mountains, particularly in all the great chains, and remarkably in all those under the equator, which are the highest upon the globe, seem to indicate, that the dry land, with all its eminencies, was originally raised out of the waters, by the force of subterraneous fire?
