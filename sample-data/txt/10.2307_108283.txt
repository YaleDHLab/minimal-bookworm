[ 3' 1 II. On the Solution of Linear Differential Equations. By CHARLES JAMES HARGREAVE, Esq., B.L., F.R.S., Professor of Jurisprudence in University College, London. Received June 10,-Read June 17, 1847. I. General Theorems of the Calculus of Operations. IF the operation of differentiation with regard to the independent variable x be denoted by the symbol D, and if p(D) represent any function of D composed of integral powers positive or negative, or both positive and negative, it may easily be shown, that p(D{-x~u=-A ,(D)u+A'xwp'(D)u+ HxZ.p."(D)u+,3 111.P11(D~, ) and that t.,4(D)u==;(D) {px.u} -+'(D) {'x.u} +24"(D) { p`x.u} 4+"'(D){p"'x.u}+.* (2.) and these general theorems are expressions of the laws under which the operations of differentiation, direct and inverse, combine with those operations which are denoted by factors, functions of the independent variable. It will be perceived that the right-hand side of each of these equations is a linear differential expression; and whenever an expression assumes or can be made to assume either of these forms, its solution is determined; for the equations p(D){Zx.u}=P and px.4(D)u=P are respectively equivalent to u=(4x)-'{p(D)}"-P and u={4(D)}-'((px)-'P). The formulae (1.) and (2.) indicate true propositions whenever they are interpretable; that is, whenever p(D) and +(D) are capable of being expressed in integer powers of D. In conformity with recognized principles of reasoning, when the subjects of the process are regarded merely as symbols, we may assume that these propositions are true generally; and we shall therefore not hesitate to pronounce any interpretable result derived from the free use of these theorems true, although the intermediate steps of the process are not capable of a rational interpretation. Bearing these remarks in mind, it will be seen, by an inspection of the above equations, that if in (1.) D be written for x, and -x (or t) be written for D, we obtain pt.4i(D')uu =(DI) {pt.u} -.4(D') {p't.u} + 2.k"(D') {1"t.u . d o D'n dentin the operation.''1 _ MThis eqainisietcl nfr wt 2) and is 32 MR. HARGREAVE ON THE SOLUTION OF therefore true; and the correctness of the result thus derived from this interchange of symbols leads to the inference, that if in any linear differential equation capable of' being reduced to the form (1.) or (2.), and its symbolical solution, x be changed into D and D into x, we shall, obtain another form accompanied by its symbolical solution. Possibly the form so obtained and its solution may not be interpretable; but in every case in which they are interpretable, they will be found to be true; and if, by any transformation, meanings can be attached to those forms which appear to be unintelligible, they also will be found to be true. It is an essential condition to be observed in all operations in which this process is used that the solutions are to be preserved in a symbolical form; or, in other words, that the operations are not to be performed or suppressed. It would manifestly be a source of error to write zero for (Zx').0, if in a subsequent stage x is to be converted into D. The process may be conveniently exemplified by applying it to the general equation of the first order, Px.Du+,x.u=X; of which the solution, (the processes being preserved,) is { ( _(pD) 1X)}, or u-xD If we make the proposed conversions, we have for the solution of -p(D){xu}+4'(D)u=X.(3.) But equation (3.), by (L.), is equivalent to xq)(D)u+((p'(D)--+(D))u=-X1or X0. Let P'(D)-4P(D)=k(D), or +(D)-@'(D)-XD. Then X(D) ) dD=log p(D) -f,(dD; and the solution assumes the form = (4>(D))-fA(D)d{x ADXo} .. . *(4.) the equation to be solved being xP(D)u+X(D)u=X0. This solution was first given by Mr. BOOLE in the Philosophical Magazine for February 1847. It indicates in a striking manner the interchange of symbols which is here proposed as a general theory; and leads naturally to the inquiry, whether such a conversion may not be extended to other forms. I am not prepared to assert that the considerations stated above actually establish its validity as a theoretical process; but it possesses considerable practical utility, when applied to a subject in which the value of the result, if true, is in a great measure independent of the validity of the process. LINEAR DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS. 33 In this paper I propose to apply the formula (1.), by the aid of Mr. BooLE'S solution above given, to the discovery of soluble forms of linear equations with variable coefficients; I shall also show that by the use of the conversion of symbols, many forms of solution apparently incapable of interpretation may be made to give useful results; and I shall point out a remarkable connection between the solutions thus obtained and the solutions of the same equations in the form of definite integrals. Amongst the cases of (4.) which are obviously and immediately interpretable, may be mentioned xp(D)u+mp'(D)u=X u =f @(D) 3m-14x-1 { (D)J}-mX J ;(D) (D)u~m( )u=X D .(6.) U={ p(D)} -Dm{x-D-mX},; but, as will be afterwards shown, most cases are interpretable when p(D) and X(D) assume the ordinary formn, and consist only of integral powers. II. Application of these Theorems to the Solution of Equations. I proceed then to apply equations (5.), in conjunction with the original theorem (I.), to the solution in finite terms of formis of linear differential equations. Commencing with equations of the second degree, we have, by (1.), {D2+ bD+c2} (X.u } =4'x.D2u+ (b4nx+ 2,'x)Du+ (c24'x+ b'4x+.41'x)u {2D+b} (%x.u} = 2.4x.Du?+ (b'4xx+2#'x)u. Consequently equations included under the form x4~x.D2U+ ((bx+2m) 4ix+2x41x)Du+ ((c2X+ bm)4'x+ (bx+2m)>4'x+ x-"x)uX, o IrJ2u+ ( b+ Du+ (C2 + ) + )u= (4x)'X=P, are readily soluble, the solution being u= (')x-'(D2+ bD +c2)mf-'{xN-(D2+ bD+c2)-mX} = (4x)-'(D2+bD +c2)m-l{x-'(D2+bD+ C2) -m(Z4 P) }. When X or P is zero, the solution may be reduced to the simpler form, u= (4x)-1(D2+bD+ c2)m-l{x-(D2+bD+c)-2.O}, which will be found to be u= (4~x)-1x-m{k?M(l + (in-1) (,3 n>+ (m.-1) 2~m(m+1) m-2~~~ m-23 m~~lmm2) \l m U6x-xnk'1+(m-1) ( 3 -+ *)+ksZl(n1)(}-~ -2 m-3m(m + 1) (m -2) mM )(+2 +(m-l)m2 (m+3(l ) I 2 m+ 3 (ma)3m a and f3 being the roots of t2+bt+c2=O. NnCCCXLvIII. p 34 MR. HARGREAVE ON THE SOLUTION tOF The solution here given is finite, in those cases only in which m is an integer positive or negative. When ni is fractional, the undeveloped expression involves fractional operations. If however b= -2c so that the roots are equal, the solution assumes the form U= (pX )-ISex(x-2m+l+kI) without any restriction upon the values of m. The form (7.) deserves particular attention, as it will be found to include the most remarkable of the equations of the second order, which have heretofore been integrated by artificial methods. Thus, if 4x=s' we have the solution of D2U+ (b+2a+r)Du+ (c2+ab+a2?(b+2a)Z)u=P, of which the well-known equation D2u+ Du+c2u=P.(8.) is a particular case; the solution being u= (D2+c2)m-l {X-1 (D2?C2)-m(XP) } If P=0, this is reduced, taking the negative sign only, to u= (D2C2)m-l {1-(kzcx+k'e-cx)}, which will be found to be U +{krcx (1-(m-1)2x+(m1)m2 mm+1)_ ) + kt?-^ZC 1+(nz-1) 2cx+ (M -I) 2 Xr(2 Zx)2i + f )} and the solution is expressible in finite terms when m is a positive or negative integer.. This equation is merely the simplest form of (7.), and is soluble by (5.) without the aid of (1.); for in it 4Ax is taken to be unity. Now let A=xn; then the solution of D2 + 2(m?n) +2 + b(mjn) n(n-l)+2mn) Dt+ b+--X Du+tc+ X + -2 2-JU= P is u=x-n(D2+bD+ C2)m-l{x-'(D2+bD+c2)-n(xn+ 'P) ,} If in this b=0 and n= -2rn+I, we have another form of solution of the equation D2u. 2(m )Du+C2U=P; namely, u =x2m-1 (D2+ C2)m-l {x-'(D2+ c2) -m(x-2m+2p) }. If n= -m, we have for the solution of D2U +bDu+ C2m(M')) u=P u =xr(D2 +61D+ c2)m-1 {X-1 (D2+ bD c2)-m(xmilP}; LINEAR DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS. 35 of which the well-known equation .D2u(m(rn2 I)?2)O is a case; the solution being u=a'm(D2+c2)m1{x-1(k sin cx+k' cos cx)} U=xm(D2C2)m-l {x-1 (kecx+ktgc) } The latter form is simply the series before found in the solution of (8.) without the factor xm. In fact the solution of (S.) is the type of the solution of (7.), when there is no second term P; for if u=ul is a solution of (8.), u=(4'x)-'u is the solution of D2u+ (2+!)Du + c2 + 7)uO. The suppression of the terms containing b does not materially impair the generality of the form; for it is well known, and follows immediately from (1.), that p (D?+) u=_ 2p(D) {s2xu}j. I have found the most convenient form of (7.) to be D2U+2QDu+ Q22+Q2+Q '_(3)UP } .(9.) ft=?-Ql (D2 + C2)m-l {1 (D2 + C2) -m(X-(m-l)QIP) } which are obtained by making Q=, +, , Q1 beingjfQdx. Useful applications may be made by eliminating the second term from (9.) by a change of the independent variable from. x to t; t and x being connected by the equation d=--2Q, One of these applications leads to an investigation calculated to throw some light upon the limited character of the solution of RICcATI's equation. If -in (9.) Q be taken we have as a soluble form, D?2+2n rDu+C2 n(n-1)-m(m-1)\ p and the elimination of the second term gives, (making d= nd z=-( t) dU 5Z+(2n1)-2 (c2z 2n-1+ (n(n1)-m(m1))z -2) u=R or pz2n-1 ,This form, therefore, and the cognate form dv +v2+(2-n2 C2z-2-i+(n (n1 ) (m-l))Z-2) = 0 are soluble, without the restriction that n must be a whole number; but when this F 2 36 MR. HARGREAVE ON THE SOLUTION OF equation is made to assume RiCcATI'S form by equating n to m, the restriction on the values to be given to n takes effect. If for n be written -n, we obtain the other form of the equation, viz. dv J Zn M-)=0 do+V2 + (2n + 1 ~(Czs+l + (n(n + 1 )-(m13z)=O which is subject to the same restriction, when assimilated to RICCATI'S form. The solution of dgu a \2 _4n is2 g+(2c1,)2Z2ZnU1O is {x (D2+c2)n'{x'ksin cx+k' cos cx)}, x being z2n-l; and that of d -2 + (2 c+ I ~8+l is x2n+1(D2+c2)1{xI(ksin cx+k'cosct4 from which, general expressions for the solution of the two corresponding forms of RICCATI'S equation may be deduced, subject to proper precautions with reference to the arbitrary constants. If we now, in a similar manner, apply the equations (6.) in conjunction with the original theorem (1.), we shall find, making p(D)=D2+bD, that equations of the form D2u + (b+ 2? )Du + ( +(b?J $+ r )uP are soluble; the solution being U= (4x) -(D2+ bD)'Dm {-D-m (Z4'x.P) } which assumes, m being integer, the form of the finite series, u= (+~x) -l(D + b)-{ XD_1(ax.P) _ ID-D2(4wZ.P) + 2 Z D' (4xtP) -2.3(m-l)(m-2)(m-3)D 4(x+x.P)+ * And again, making b=O and Q=a+-x+2mr, we have foithe integral of D2u+2QDu+ (Q22QJ(,; )u= P, u=x22Q1Dm I-{D m(x 2?'Q1P)}. By processes in all respects similar, integrable forms of equations of the third and higher orders may be obtained. For equations of the third oider, it will be found LINEAR DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS. 37 that the expressions (5.) give, suppressing b, D3u + 3(MkJ+4D2U+ (c+ 6m $ + 31 r + x +L(J )f $ + )P x x ~~x +X ?,1X kJfkajFx xjx4x 4x u = (ix) -'(D3+ cD+f)m-l{x-1(D3+cD+f)-m(x4#x.P) }; or D3u+3QD2u+ (c+3(Q2+Q') _3m(M2 '1)Du+ (+cQ+Q3+Q"'+3QQ' -3m(m-1) Q+(m l)n(m+1) ) p -3 2 Q+--3-y u=azrn-Qi(D3+ cD +f)m1 {l -(D3+ cD+f) -m (V-m+lgQp) } And the expressions (6.) give D3u+ (b +j +3L )D2U+ (c++2 (b+!j!x+3 f?)Du + (C + C+ + A u= (+xv) ' (D2+bD + c) -1Dm-1Q-D-i(xix.P)} It is obvious, however, that the generality of the soluble forms becomes less, as the order of the equation rises. The solutions derived from (5.) and (6.) as particular forms of (4.), have been given in the first instance on account of their peculiar simplicity; but more general forms are derived by the use of (4.). The expressions (4.) represent the solution of linear equations of any order, in the factors of which no power of x higher than the first appears. The general form is (at ++b)Dnu+(an-Ix+be i)Do-lzt+.**+(alx+b1)Du+(aox+bo)u=X, . . (10.) in which A~t_ bath+b._ t1+ . . + bt +bo pt= aJt+ a_ lt' +1.. + alt + ao /bo b, + A + B _ dt= t+ log ((tz)A(tP)B(ty)C. ) . d. .1 where a, j3 rX &c. are the roots of ItO -; and A, B, C, &c. are found fr om the rational fraction Consequently the solution of this equation is a (anDn + an_ ,Dn'I. + ajD + ao) ls (D _)(D _ 3 . .(I C ?an (D-z)AD_0The factor &aD denotes that x is to be changed into x a. and the factor SaaD denotes that x is to be changed into x+a ; but these factors may be dispensed with by making b_=0a which does not diminish the generality of the form. 38 MR. HARGREAVE ON THE SOLUTION OF If, for example, we apply this theorem to the solution of D2u+(al +bi)Du+(aoxv+bo)u=X; we have the rational fraction bit +bo A?bla+bo B -1p+bo t2+a t+ao' a3 u=(D2+aD +a)-1 (D-Ce)A(Dp-)B(x{ (Da) -A(D -3)-X The performance of the operations requires that A, B, &c. shall be whole numbers; and these are the conditions under which the equations are soluble in finite terms. If we combine with the above general form the formula (1.), we obtain the solution of the equation (an x+ Jbn) Dnu+ an-1x? bl ?n(ax+ be) , + {an-2x+bn-2 +(n]) (a. lx +bn 1) -,X+qMscn (an + bn)V Dga }n-2U ~~Px~ ~ ~ x F 'li~ ~ ~~~~~X )n-2 4,x n-1ln-2 1X +an-3-V+bn-3+(n -2) (an-2X+ b :+ (n-) 2 axnf-3gzn2 3(axb)\ ~~~~~~~~~~~~ )2~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-)(a,-1x+b 1)-x n 2 ax3 +...-X in the form U=(%x)'1(anD +an1Dt-1+ .)a(D' -(D -3)B a, (D-e) (D .-...3). (4@xX) The important limitation, that A, B, &c. must be whole numbers in order that the operations may be practicable, must not be overlooked; and with reference to this point, the attention of the reader is called to the solutions by means of definite integrals given in a subsequent part of this paper. If two or more of the roots oa, A, &c. are equal, we obtain amongst the operations expressions of the form a (D)")' which do not appear to be interpretable in finite terms; but the corresponding solution in the form of a definite integral will apply. III. Solution of Equations by interchange of Symbols alone. It has been already ol)served, that the operation or set of operations denoted by any function of D is not of itself intelligible, unless the function is capable of expansion in integer powers of D, so that fractional operations may not be introduced; but if, by means of the transformation above indicated, the function of D becomes in result changed into a function of x, such a result is intelligible, and may be relied on as true, although the expressions introduced during the process may be purely symbolical and incapable of interpretation. Thus U= (D2C2)mi-{arl(D2-c2)-mX}, regarded as the solution of a(D2c2)u+2mDu= Xx LINEAR DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS. 39 is not interpretable in finite terms when m is fiactional. Yet u= c2)m-1D{j,2_ c2)-mX}, regarded as the solution of D{(X2 c2)u}-2mxu=X, or (X2 _c2)Du-2(m-l)xu=X, (these forms being derived from the others by changing D into x and x into D), is interpretable for all values of m, and is correct. Again, it has already appeared that the solution of D +2n a(2n(n-1)-M0(M~-1)) D2U+-Du+ (c2+ (U 1) is u=xvm,-(D2+C2)m-lx l(D2+C2)-m (n-m+lp) }; which is not interpretable in finite terms when m is fractional. But if this equation be multiplied by x2 and transformed as before, we get (X2+ c2)D2u-2(n-2)xDu+ ((n-l)(n-2)-m(m l))u=D2P=R suppose; and we infer the solution to be u=Dm-,f{(X2+C2)m1-D-'f (X2+C2)-mD-mlR} }; which is interpretable though m be fractional, provided mn be an integer; or the equation (X2+c2)D2u-2axDu+b(2ab+ l)u=R is soluble when b is a whole number; the solution being u=D-(b+1){ (X2+c2)a-bD (X2+c2) (a4 +I)DbR} } of which a remarkable case is, (a=O) D2Utb2 2b ?cU( U= e+c2=X (suppose) U=D(b+1'){(,V2+C2)-bD-l{(X2+C2)b-lDb((X2+c2)X)} }. In applying these forms great caution must be used with reference to the introduction of constants. The processes indicated in the value of u show b+2 constants.; which renders it necessary to determine b of them in terms of the other two by reference to the original equation. Thus, suppose we require the integrals of the equations (1 +x2)D2u-2u=x, and (l +V2)D2u -2u=a. The form of both solutions is the same, viz. U=kD -3+1)2 40 MR. HARGREAVE ON THE SOLUTION OF whence we have D2u=k 1 2+I2 tan-x)r+kn k Du=-x tan-lx+k'x+k" uj ((L+X2) tan-axk) +2 +?kx+kl". Verifying the first equation by these values, we find k_2 and k'-2, the solution, therefore, is k P( +2) uz=((I+.V2) tan-'+x)-2+2(1+x2). k k'-a Verifying the second equation, we find k"= and k"'=-and the solution is k k' a u=-((1 +x2) tan-'x+x) +2 (1 +,2) If the general form of the above differential equation be divided by X2+c2, and the second term be eliminated, by changing the independent variable from x to t, by means of the assumed equation d= (x2+2), we obtain d2u dt2 + b(2ab+ 1)R (+c2-(2a+)uR(x2+c2)(2a+13= R0 suppose. In order that the factor of u may be expressed in terms of the new variable, we must dt solve -= (-2+ C2)a, and then find x2+ c2 in terms of t. For most values of a, the equation between x and t is transcendental; but particular soluble cases may be found. Thus, if a=-then x=c tan ct, a2+c2=2ct' and the equation becomes d2u2 d2b(b +l 1)o2 CtUR0; whose solution, therefore, is U=D -(bl { (x2+ c2)(6+l)D-'{ (X2 + c2) bD ( ((X2 + c2) -'Ro) } which becomes, when Ro=-0 =k (^+l) (Z2 x being c tan ct. The original equation is not altered by writing b for b+ 1; so that a particular solution may be readily deduced from the simple form u kD = ( + c2) . This equation will reappear under another form in the sequel. LINEAR DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS. 41 3 c2 Again, if a=2, then c2+x2-and the equation becomes d 2_(b+ 9) c4U -R1; whose solution, therefore, is u=D~-(b ) { (,2+ c2) -(b+)D1{ (X2+c2)b+Db(x2+c2Ro) } }. Trhus the solution of d2u 3 dt2 1-Ut2)2 is U=k(j l+)t2+k.t The principle illustrated in this section may be further exemplified and usefully applied, by attempting the solution of the general equation of the second order, qx.D2u+ x.Du +x.u=P. By the interchange of symbols, we have (p(D)(x2u) -4 (D) (xu) + ?z(D)u = P or x2p(D)u + 2xp'(D)u+ pi'(D) u -P -(D) u -'(D) u = P. +'?(D)uJ This equation is soluble if Z(D)u= {4'(D)-p"(D)}u; for it then assumes the form xp(D)u+ (2p(D) -4,(D))u==v-'P; the solution of which, by (4.), is u p(D)E/ D) X-1(p(D))-2E4d f lp}D }x1P and, by restoring the symbols, we get for the solution of pLr.Dlu+ lx.Du+ (4'xp"x)u =P, u= _Wd{ (ix) 2fdxD(p) } the correctness of which may be ascertained by verification. If qAx=(n+1)p'x, we have for the solution of px.D2u+ (n + 1 )px. Du +np"x.u= P, u (?x) Jtpx)n-jPdxdx. If 4x be made equal to Qpx, and P to Rpx, we get for the solution of D2u+QDu? Q'+QR, u= ~x.&-QxD' { (r) 2&Q]D'(Rpx) }. MDCCCXL.VIII. G 42 MR.

IV. Application to Partial Differential Equations. Most of the soluble forms above deduced are readily convertible into analogous forms of partial differential equations, by substituting for the constants any function of Y, where D' denotes differentiation with regard to a new independent variable. TIbus if in (9.) for Q we write f(x, D') and for c we write V-IkD', we have the symbolical solution of d2u I dI du d2u_ dP+2fx 7 kd2+ f2+fl M(;_'))U=P, where P may be a function of x and y. .f d n d For example, if fZv, d} be of the form y the equation becomes dqu 2n dOu Wn XdX n du m(m-1) d~d ~t ;pk2 } -FU 2=,A(w ) wz-~i X -d4 P dy dy of which the solution is u = eS ng -D(D2-k2D'2)m {Xl(D 2-_k2D 12)-1mj-(r4-1) nlogx.l qkxJ ( ) Now (nox.D`4(x, zi) =4({, y+n log x), and a-n1ogx .w kX, y) ( y-n log x).

Transforming this equation to new' independent valuables p and q, by the equations p=y-X1x+kx, _q=y-_lX--kx, or 2k 'Y=X(2)+ we have, as a soluble form, d 1u np +qX Iddu & f1 dF do, mm-) dpdq?2J"( 2k J ( td?~V)J + (k A< +2k(+) mqrnI)) u-?p(p q) the function X disappearing in the process.

If a=O, we have the solution of d2u m(m-1) dpdqp q; and if a=m, we have the solution of d$u m (du du) dpjq +pq adp + dq) from which the solution of d2 4m d2u may be obtained by making s=0 S(paq) -2t 2m-1 t=c(P-0) Returning to the' general form and making Xx=0. we havre f~or the solution of d2Xu u +2i.du + p2 p m(m1) dy2 d2lmx XIs1.

It is well known that many of the differential equations integrated by the above processes, and whose integrals are in some cases capable of an expression merely symbolical by reason of the number of operations to be performed being fractional, may be integrated generally, when there is no second term, by means of definite integrals. Now with reference to most of the equations of this description here integrated, I have observed that the symbolical form above given is capable of being instantly (and, as it were, mechanically) converted into a definite integral of the form eb UfMy Z.stfdz, a the function pz being typified in the symbolical solution by the form of the operations preceding the factor x-l. To explain this, let us take the equation 2rn D2u+-Du-c2u0 its symbolical solution is au -k(D2C2)mfi {Z7'(JY;c2>-m0}; LINEAR DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS. 45 and the assertion is that a solution of the equation in the form of a definite integral is obtained by writing for fz, k(Z2-c2)m-l and selecting the limits properly; in fact, it is known that u = kf(z2 -c2)m lzdz is a partial solution; and as it is a known theorem, that if u=ul solve D2U+ l+ IDu-C2U 0 x it is also solved by u=xnul if for n be written -n, we have for the complete solution U=k Z(!2c2)m-lezxdz rkx-2m2?

In like manner, if we apply this mode of conversion to the umiore general form D2U+2QDu+ (Q2+Q _ C2De )u O. of which the solution expressed symbolically is ux xm-Qi(D2-C2)m-lfx-l(D2-c2)-lO}, the definite integral ought to be u kxm&-VQ:j~(Z2 1 )sxdz + klv-m+ I-Qf (Z2 1 ) -msczdz, and this is in fact the solution. The limits must be determined by verifying the equation and assigning them. accordingly; the verification at the same time establishing in the particular cases the correctness of the results arrived at by the substitution. Thus, if we take the general form xp(D)u+?(D)u=O, and its sy mbolical solution U= {<;(D); SX(D)~,t,IS-(D)o} where zt==ftdt, the conversion here indicated gives u= kf Qz) -la5ztzdz. 46 MR. HARGREAVE ON THE SOLUTION OF To verify this, we have p(D)u=fz Vx d 4'(D)u= /' s dz;f7 d(?Z) = s z fsXdz, and the equation is verified, if ssox vanishes between the limits. Whether the limits can be so taken depends upon the form of zz. Apply this to xD'u+u=O. Here 4:=znz Z-2i+I and u=k___--f+izdz. z-n + The limits 0 and ac cause s n al to vanish and satisfy the equation. So that f0 z-nf I UkJ Z s-%+i* dz is a partial solution; which may be completed by writing for z, z, f3z, &c. where 1, ,f &c. are the roots r i. Again, if we apply the above solution to In-7u=O0, we have xz=-, 4 ,z= _ zn~l and Umt/ -sdz. n+1 Here, there do not appear to be any limits which will make r Th vanish ; but if we take for the limits 0 and oc we have Dnu-x-u=k. This last equation is also solved /,o z_+l by u=kc J0 s+1 dz,a being a root of rt =i. Therefore the original equation is solved by oc zn+1 U = Ef g n e (-06) dz, which may be completed by the use of the other roots*. Let us apply this method to the solution of (anX+bn)D u+(.

There can be no doubt that this remarkable connection between the symbolical solution and the solution by definite integrals is not merely accidental, but is founded upon a similarity in the processes by which they would be respectively arrived at in a general system of solution.

HARGREAVE ON THE SOLUTION OF VII. Miscellaneous Forms. In the course of the preceding investigations, I was led to attempt the solution of some forms of equations by means of successive operations not consisting. exclusively of D combined with constants, but involving also functions of X. The only important result which I obtained is the following, being a slight generalization of the method originally employed by me in effecting the solution of the equation of LAPLACE'S coefficients.' The equation D2u+ bDu+c2un(n+ I) u-X is solved as follows. Let a and j be the roots of z2+bz+c2=O, and assume Duau=ui. Then Du1-fPul n(n+ 1)-ou-=X, Cos XU=n(n?+ )(Du I-43ul-X), cos2 X 2cos. sinx ( COS2 X, Du-au= ) (D u1 + bDu, + cu+) (Du,43u,) (Dn(+ X =U or D2u ?+bDul +c2u1 -2 tan x.(Du1l-6ul) xu+)1 =X'"X-2 tanx.X-Xsuppose.

Similarly, if we assume Du2-&'u2-4 tan x.u2=u3, we obtain D2u3+bDu3+c2u3-6 tan x.(Du3 f332) U3=?X',ax X suppose. Proceed in like manner until we arrive at the assumption Do. au. 2n tan x.u._ u.+ . Then :D2?1+ bDu+1+c2u,+?1-2(n+1) tan x.(Du.+ ,-f3u+,l)=X(,+,). Let Du _PUn+i=Q then DQ-ocQ 2(n+ 1) tan x.Q=X(.+1, and Q=Set(cos X 2(n+ ax (Cos X)2(ff'lX(n+l)dwx u,,l = tfe$)f(cos x) s(n+l?/-an(cos 1) + Un-= e(cos *v) s -f2(cos x)22uI +v1dx; LINEAR DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS. 53 and so on down to u, which will be found to be, d -n ?fim( ta ) J(A9)x (cos x) 2:fa(M-?X( cos x) -2(n+1'fa~Z xV(coS X) 2(n+t)X x(ns+ ldx2dxrdx-; and if X-O, this becomes (d u=?ks (tan x)) fa(g3-&)x(cos x)2:fS(i-?Z(cos x)-2(,+' )dvdx}, proper precautions being taken with regard to the introduction of constants. Perhaps the difficulties relating to the constants may be evaded by writing the solution in the form u =kex d {( {G-z)xcos (s)2(2n+1/(?A((CoSx) 2(n? dx}, and then substituting (n+ 1) for n, which does not alter the original equation, we have U = khan' (d(t a) { 6(A-') (cos xV) -2fS(a-)(cos xS)2nddv}. If a and 3 are both zero, we have for the solution of D2u-n(n+ 1) u =O? u=k(d(t {a)) (coSTx) -2f(cos x)2ndx} =kQd)f {(+y2 ) } (d)( where y= tan x. Let c=c and 3=-c, so that the original equation becomes d2u c2u-n(n+1) X=? then the solution is u = kcx (d i) {f-2cx(cos X)2:S2cx(cos 2 )-2(n+ )dxdx} k*icx(d(I + )) {f -2c(cos x) -2(X+ l 2cx(COS X)2ddx}, which contains the proper number of constants; as the constant which enters by reason of the first integration disappears by the subsequent differentiations. This solution will apply to LAPLACE'S equation, if for c be written cady This gives for the solution of d2u d2u u C2dn(n+ 1> 4/ d n\ U= S CXdY 6 { 2xdy(COS X) 2'f(cos 2Vc) } J2c,)dx \d(tani x) 54 MR.
