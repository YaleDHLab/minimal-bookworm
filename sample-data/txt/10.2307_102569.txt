VI. An Account of what happened to a Child on swallowing two Copper Farthings. Communicated by Dr. Edward Baynard, Fellow of the College of Physitians. I Living then in Worcester, my Son William Underhill, aged about Three Years, swallowed by accident two Copper Farthings, but half a Year one after the other. Upon the first Farthing, he eat nothing for ten Days, and complained of a great Pain at his Stomach, and drivel'd as if he had been salivated; and often said he had a nauseous venomous Taste in his Mouth, the Farthing not coming from him in half a Year. After the swallowing of the second Farthing he began by Degrees to lose his Limbs, his Breast growing narrow, and the Child Consumptive;who was after perfectly cured by the Bath, and his Breast dilated and grew broad as before. This happening about Ten Years since, these are most of the Particulars I can remember. Witness my Hand, Her. Underhill. VII.
