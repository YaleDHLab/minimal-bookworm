[534] LXXXVI. Observations for proving the Going of Mr. Ellicott's Clock, at St. Helena; by Mr. Charles Mason. IN my return from the cape of Good Hope, the clock, used in the observations made there, was set going at James's fort, St. Helena, the pendulum remaining as at the Cape. Here I found myself at a great loss, to get observations to prove its motion, the heavens being almost perpetually covered with clouds. At length, considering, that the place being situated in such a narrow deep valley, if the times of the descent of the stars, over the western ridge of rocks, (the altitude of whose nearest summit was about 30~, and distant about a quarter of a mile, at the observatory) were observed, it would give the time per clock, in a sidereal day; and the chances for such observations would be greater, than by any other method, as they might be continued the whole night. Accordingly, I began to observe, by fixing the eye to a point: but this was soon improved, by the Reverend Mr. Maskelyne, by making the stars descend each night, in the same part of the telescope of the equal altitude instrument: and it was very beautiful to see, how instantaneously they disappeared. Read May 6, 1762. The difference of the effect of gravity at the two places, on the going of the clock, may be seen, by comparing the following with the observations made at the Cape. 1761.

The clock taken down, and the pendulum secured, as at the cape of Good Hope, after the direction given per Mr. Ellicott the maker. From the mean of a great number of observations, taken at November 68.7 from 12th different times of the day and in December 70.3 to night, Farenheit's thermoJanuary 72.3 the 18th. meter stood at The thermometer was hung by the side of the clock, and I never saw it higher (from 12th of November 1761 to January 18th, 1762) than 741/2, or lower than 67. Those observations marked: are a little dubious. Charles Mason.
