[466] RAPHAELIS FABRETTI Urbinatis de Aquis & Aquaeductibus veteris Romae Dissertationes tres in Quarto Romae, 1680. 1. THe first Discourse of the noble and ingenious Fabretti represents the Art and Grandure of the Aquaeductus Alexandrinus, which taking name from Severus the Emperor, as Spartianus assures, runs obliquely for a good Foundation, yet lostily,in most places upon an Arc LXX foot high,through Procoio di Pantano between the Via Labicana and Praenestina,hard by the noble Sepulcher of the said Emperor and his Mother,unto the Vineyard of the Carthusians in the City,at 14 miles distance from its Fountain. The Duct or Specus is 21/2 foot broad, 41/2 high, and thick in the sides 21/4, admitting in divers places an Aperturs or Breath-hole made of Tophus 21/2 foot square: and is sustein'd by square Piles of Brick, 8 foot thick, well cemented and inwardly polisht; and cover'd with an Arc of the same matter 12 foot over. 2 The second Dissertation, which treats of Aqua Marcia and Claudia, is opportunely prefac't with the measure of the Old Roman Foot: which this Learned Italian asserts to be the ~ ~, that L. Paetus procur'd, more than an hundred years since, to be exprest on a marble Table in the Capitol, together with the Roman Palm of nine inches, and the Canna Ar~ of ten ~, and the Decempeda or Rod of ten Foot. Our Author comparing the two last together, found the Modern or Architectonic Palm to make near 91/11 inches of the Ancient Roman Foot, the Canna ~ reaching to 73/7 ~ of the old Decempeda: and consequently that a Roman Mile, or 5000 Foot, contains near 660 1/5 of the modern Cannae; not 667 Cannae, as L Holstenius estimates in his Discourse De ~ Aureo, mistaking the modern Roman Palm for just 3/4 of the Antique Roman Foot, Much less will 650. Cannae of the Later Surveiors extend to the length of an old Roman mile, as ~. Paetus computed. But the measure of the Pes Capitolinus on the marble Table foremention'd, (and not the Print of it p. 88 L. ~ de mensuris, too scanty by 3/4 of an inch,) is sufficiently confirmed by three joynted Brass-Feet found in different places, and by several Bricks, carrying one Foot in length, and an half in bredth, taken up from the Ruins in Via ~ and in divers other places. Where[467] Wherefore this Capitol Foot ought to be preferred unto the rude Draughts on the Monuments of the ancient Architects, M. ~, T. Statilius, and (n. ~; which last is taken for the very Roman Foot by the honor of ourNation Dr. John Greaves. Yet this as well as the Statilian, falls short of the Capitol-Foot by near 1/8 part of an inch, whereas the AEbutian is about as much too large. Moreover the Villalpandine Module, argued loosely and inversly from the Content of the ~Congius, exceeds by 1/5 of an Inch the Capitoline or True Roman Foot: for to this do precisely agree, says our wise and experienced Author, the numerous Patterns and Remains of ancient Architecture, that are daily dug up about the City. Soon after he gives a public Example of the ~ Foot, telling us it sutes exactly with the 73. of those cxxv. spaces into which ~ divides his Semicircular Instrument p. 3~6. Comment in Ezech. Lastly, the Foot which Ricciolus offers us for Roman in his ~. p 58 surpasseth the Capitoline by a full Digit, or 1/16 of the whole: and his other measure Geograph. Reform. f. 34. by 1/18 part. But to return to our Aquaduct, highly extoll'd by Pliny, Plutarch, Arrian, Frontinus~ and in this Clause of Propertius, ~ Marcius humor opus. This Water taking its name from King ~, and as deservedly from Publius and Quintus, in the same Marcian Family, ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~, &c. ariseth not from the Lacus Fucinus (whence Pliny and Statius would fetch it) but in the Crossepath between the Via Valeria and ~, two miles short of Caerulus and Curtius, the Fountains of qua Claudia: but observes the same Level with the Claudian; because it descends more precipitate from the Origine. Yet within 5 miles of Rome the Aqua Marcia runs 20 Foot lower than the Aqua Claudia. But at 7 miles distance from Rome, and at a mile and an half from the midway to ~, as Fabretti after Frontinus exactly measur'd, the Aqua Marcia is both purified and moduled, by falling into, and soon after rising up from a long square Piscina or Cistern, 6 foot deep, made of Flint, and cover'd with a Net work, by order of Hadrian the Emperor. Now the latter use of these Ponds or Cesterns, that sufflaminate the Current of the Aquaducts, is frequently taken notice of by Frontinus: so that Signior Castelli his belov'd Probleme, Ex ~ aquae ~ ~ variare, is not so new as he pretends. The [468] 3. The third Dissertation concerning Aquaeducts, the best Argument, by the confession of Dionysius, Strabo, Pliny and others, of the Magnificence of Rome, remarques that of the fourteen Aquaeducts which Procopius found at the City in his time, ten are now quite lost; and the other four, namely Aqua Crabra or Damnata, Trajana, Alexandrina, and Virgo much corrupted. The last so much fam'd in Antiquity, arising near Rivus ~, is derived unto Porta Flaminia at the length of LXIII. Acres or 3024. Roman Paces. For to the Ports of Rome, and not (as the Incomparable Holstenius contends) from the gilded Miliarium, the conducts of Ways and Waters are precisely to be estimated. Upon this occasion Signior Fabretti ingeniously acknowledges, against ~ Exorbitance of J. Li ~ and others, that the compass of Rome (~ Urbis) by its Ancient Poris, should be reduc't in Plinies numbers from XIII. by an easie change unto VIII Miles; to accord to the the magnitude of Athens, which is the Assertion of ~: as also to the limits of ~, within the ridge of the Hills, the ~, the ~, and the Agger. Yet (Rom ~) ~ taken with all its Suburbs, according to the same Pliny and to this Dissertator, made a wide Circuit of LXX. ~. This in brief from the three Learned Discourses of Signior Raphael Fabretti. ER
