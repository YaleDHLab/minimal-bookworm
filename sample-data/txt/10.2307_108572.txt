[ 407 ] XVIII. On a Theory of the Syzygetic* relations of two rational integralfunctions, comprising an application to the Theory of STURM'S Functions, and that of the greatest Algebraical Common Measure. By J. J. SYLVESTER, M.A. Dub., F.R.S., Barrister at Law., and formerly Professor of Natural Philosophy in University College, London. Received and Read June 16, 1853. INTRODUCTION. "How charming is divine philosophy! Not harsh and crabbed as dull fools suppose, But musical as is Apollo's lute, And a perpetual feast of nectar'd sweets, Where no crude surfeit reigns !"-CoMus. IN the first section of the ensuing memoir, which is divided into five sections, I consider the nature and properties of the residues which result from the ordinary process of successive division (such as is employed for the purpose of finding the greatest common measure) applied tofix) and p(x), two perfectly independent rational integral functions of x. Every such residue, as will be evident from considering the mode in which it arises, is a syzygetic function of the two given functions; that is to say, each of the given functions being multiplied by an appropriate other function of a given degree in x, the sum of the two products will express a corresponding residue. These multipliers, in fact, are the numerators and denominators to the successive convergents to , expressed under the form of a continued fraction. If now we proceed a priori by means of the given conditions as to the degree in (x) of the multipliers and of any residue, to determine such residue, we find, as shown in art. (2.), that there are as many homogeneous equations to be solved as there are constants to be determined; accordingly, with the exception of one arbitrary factor which enters into the solution, the problem is definite; and if it be further agreed that the quantities entering into the solution shall be of the lowest possible dimensions in respect of the coefficients of f and p, and also of the lowest numerical denomination, then the problem (save as to the algebraical sign of plus or minus) becomes absolutely determinate, and we can assign the numbers of the dimensions for the respective residues and syzygetic multipliers. The residues given by the method of successive division are easily seen not * Conjugate would imply something very different from Syzygetic, viz. a theory of the Invariantive properties of a system of two algebraical functions.

SYLVESTER ON A THEORY OF THE CONJUGATE to be of these lowest dimensions; accordingly there must enter into each of them a certain unnecessary factor, which, however, as it cannot be properly called irrelevant, I distinguish by the name of the Allotrious Factor. The successive residues, when divested of these allotrious factors, I term the Simplified Residues, and in article (3.) and (4.) 1 express the allotrious factors of each residue in terms of the leading coeffid cients of the preceding simplified residues of f and p. In article (5.) I proceed to determine by a direct method these simplified residues in terms of the coefficients of f and h. Beginning with the case wheref and p are of the samte dimensions (in) in x, I observe that we may deduce from f and p m linearly independent functions of x each of the degree (m1) in x, all of them syzygetic functions off and P (vanishing when these two simultaneously vanish), and with coefficients which are made up of terms, each of which is the product of one coefficient of f and one coefficient of @. ,rhese, in fact, are the very same (m) functions as are employed in the method which goes by the name of BEZOUT's abridged method to obtain the resultant to (t. e. the result of the elimination of x performed upon)f and p. As these derived functions are of frequent occurrence, I find it necessary to give them a namne, and I term them the (m) Bezoutics or Bezoutian Primaries; from these (m) primaries m Bezoutian secondaries may be deduced by eliminating linearly between them in the order in which they are generated,-first, the highest power of x between two, then the two highest powers of x between three, and finally, all the powers of x between them all: along with the system thus formed it is necessary to include the first Bezoutian primary, and to consider it accordingly as being also the first Bezoutian secondary; the last Bezoutian secondary is a constant identical with the Resultant off and p. When the m times mn coefficients of the Bezoutian primaries are conceived as separated from the powers of x and arranged in a square, I term such square the Bezoutic square. This square, as shown in art. (7.), is symmetrical above one of its diagonals, and corresponds therefore (as every symmetrical matrix must do) to a homogeneous quadratic function of (m) variables of which it expresses the determinant. This quadratic function, which plays a great part in the last section and in the theory of real roots, I term the Bezoutiant; it mav be regarded as a species of generating function. Returning to the Bezoutic system, I prove that the Bezoutian secondaries are identical in form with the successive simplified residues. In art. (6.) I extend these results to the case off and p being of different dimensions in x. In art. (7.) 1 give a mechanical rule for the construction of the Bezoutic square. In art. (8.) I show how the theory of f(x) and @(x), where the latter is of an inferior degree to f, may be brought under tihe operation of the rule applicable to two functions of the same degree at the expense of the introduction of a known and very simple factor, which in fact will be a constant power of the leading coefficient inf x). In art. (9.) I give another method of obtaining directly the simplified residues in all cases. In art. (10.) I present the process of successive division under its most general aspect. In arts. (11.) and (12.) I demonstrate the identity of the algebraical sign of the Bezoutianl secondaries with RELATIONS OF TWO ALGEBRAICAL FUNCTIONS. 409 that of the simplified residues, generated by a process corresponding to the development of e under the form of an improper continued fraction (where the negative sign takes the place of the positive sign which connects the several terms of an ordinary continual function). As the simplified residue is obtained by driving out an allotrious factor, the signs of the former will of course be governed by the signs accorded by previous convention to the latter; the convention made is, that the allotrious factors shall be taken with a sign which renders them always essentially positive when the coefficients of the given functions are real. I close the section with remarking the relation of the syzygetic factors and the residues to the convergents of the continued fraction which expresses T, and of the continued fraction which is formed by reversing the order of the quotients in the first named fraction. In the second section I proceed to express the residues and syzygetic multipliers in terms of the roots and factors of the given functions; the method becoming as it may be said endoscopic instead of being exoscopic*, as in the first section. I begin in arts. (14.) and (15.) with obtaining in this way, under the forin of a sum or double sum of terms involving factors and roots of f and p, and certain arbitrary functions of the roots in each term, a general representative, or to speak more precisely, a group of general representatives for a conjunctive of any given degree in x tof and , i. e. a rational integral function of x, which is the sum of the products of f and p multiplied respectively by rational integral functions of x, so as to vanish of necessity when f and p simultaneously vanish. This variety of representatives refers not merely to the appearance of arbitrary functions, but to an essential and precedent difference of representation quite irrespective of such arbitrariness. In articles (16.), (17.), (18.), (19.), (20.), (21.), 1 show how the arbitrary form of function entering into the several terms of any one (at pleasure) of the formulae that represent a conjunctive of any given degree may be assigned, so as to make such conjunctive identical in form with a simplified residue of the same degree. The form of arbitrary function so assigned, it may be noticed, is a fractional function of the roots, so that the expression becomes a sum or double sum of fractions. I first prove in arts. (16.), (17.) that such sum is essentially integral, and I determine the weight of its leading coefficient in respect of the roots of f and p (this weight being measured * These words admit of an extensive and important application in analysis. Thus the methods for resolving an equation (or to speak more accurately, for making one equation depend upon another of a simpler form) furnished by TSCHIRNHAUSEN and Mr. JERRARD (although not so presented by the latter) are essentially exoscopic; on the other hand, the methods of LAGRANGE and ABEL for effecting similar objects are endoscopic. So again, the memoir of JACOBI, " De Eliminatione," hereinafter referred to, takes the exoscopic, and the valuable " Nota ad Eliminationem pertinens " of Professor RICHELOT in CRELLE'S Journal, the endoscopic view of the subject. In the present memoir (in which the two trains of thought arising out of these distinct views are brought into mutual relation) the subject is treated (chiefly but not exclusively) under its endoscopic aspect in the second, thiird and fourth sectionls, and exoscopically in the first and last sections. 3 H2 410 MR. SYLVESTER ON A THEORY OF THE CONJUTGArE by the number of roots off and p conjointly, which appear in any term of such coefficient). Now in the succeeding articles I revert to the Bezoutic system of the first section, and beginning with the supposition of m and n being equal, I demonstrate that the most general form of a conjunctive of any degree in x will be a linear function of the Bezoutics, from which it is easy to deduce that the simplified residues of any given degree in x are the conjunctives whose weight in respect of the roots is a minimum; so that all conjunctives having that weight must be identical (to a numerical factor pres), and any integral form of less weight apparently representing a conjunctive must be nugatory, every term vanishing identically. These results are then extended to the case of two functions of unlike degrees. The conclusion is, that the weight of the forms assumed in (16.) and (17.) being equal to the minimum weight, they must (unless they were to vanish, which is easily disproved) represent the simplified residues, or which is the same thing, the Bezoutian secondaries. We thus obtain for each simplified residue a number of essentially distinct forms of representation, but all of which must be identical to a numerical factor prAs, a result which leads to remarkable algebraical theorems. The number of these different formulae depends upon the degree of the residue; there being only one for the last or constant residue, two for the last but one, three for the last but two, and so on. The formulke continue to have a meaning when their degree in x exceeds that of f or p; but then, as although always representing conjunctives, they no longer represent residues, this identity no longer continues to subsist. In articles (22.), (23.), (24.), (25.), I enter into some developments connected with the general formulke in question: these, it may be observed, are all expressed by means of fractions containing in the numerator and denominator products of differences; the differences in the numerator products being taken between groups of roots of f and groups of roots of p; and in the denominator between roots of f inter se and roots of p inter se. A great enlargement is thus opened out to the ordinary theory of partial fractions. In art. (26.) I find the numerical ratios between the different formulae which represent (to a numerical factor pros) the same simplified residue, and in arts. (27.) and (28.) I determine the relations of algebraical sign of these formulae to the simplified residues or Bezoutian secondaries. In art. (29.) I determine the syzygetic multipliers corresponding to any given residue in terms of the factors and roots of the given functions; but the expressions for these, which are closely analogous to those for the residues, cease to be polymorphic. They are obtained separately from the syzygetic equation, and it is worthy of notice, that to obtain the one we use the first of the polymnorphic expressions for the residue, and to obtain the other the opposite extremity of the polymorphic scale. In the subsequent articles -of this section, by aid of certain general properties of continued fractions, I establish a theorem of reciprocity between the series of residues and either series of syzygetic mnulti pliers. RELATIONS OF TWO ALGEBRAICAL FUNCTIONS. 411 Section III. is devoted to a determination of the values of the preceding formulae for the residues and multipliers in the case applicable to M. STURM's theorem, where <(x) becomes the differential derivative offx. It becomes of importance to express the formula for this case in terms of their roots and factors of fx alone, without the use of the roots and factors of f'x, which will of course be functions of the former. By selecting a proper form out of the polymorphic scale, the fractional terms of the series for each residue in this case become separately integral, and we obtain my wellknown formulae for the simplified residues (STURM's reduced auxiliary functions) in temrs of the factors and the squared differences of partial groups of roots. This is shown in art. (35.). In art. (36.) the multiplier offx in the syzygetic equation is expressed by formula of equal simplicity, and in a certain sense complementary to the former. This method, however, does not apply to obtaining expressions for the multiplier of fx in the same equation in terms of the roots and factors of fx; for the separate fractions whose sum represents any one of these factors it will be found do not admit of being expressed as integral functions of the roots and factors. To obviate this difficulty I look to the syzygetic equation itself, which contains five quantities, viz. the given function, its first differential derivative, the residue of a given degree, and the two multipliers, all of which, except the multiplier of fx, are known, or have been previously determined as rational integral functions of the roots and factors of fx. I use this equation itself for determining the fifth quantity, the multiplier in question. To perform the general operations by a direct method required for this would be impossible; the difficulty is got over by finding, by meatns of the syzygetic equation, the particular form that the result must assume when certain relations of equality spring up between the roots of fx; and then, by aid of these particular determinations, the general form is demonstratively inferred. This investigation extends over arts. (38.), (39.), (40.), (41.), (42.), (43.). It turns -out that the expressions for the multipliers offx are of much greater complexity than for the multipliers of 'x or for the residues. Any such multiplier consists of a sum of parts, each of which, as in the case of the residues and of the factors of f'x, is affected with a factor consisting of the squared differences of a group of roots; but the other factor, instead of being simply (as for the residues and factors before mentioned) a product of certain factors of fr, consists of the sum of a series of products of sumns -of powers by products of combinations of factors of fx, each of which series is affected with the curious anomaly of its last term, becoming augmented in a certain numerical ratio beyond what it should be, in order to be conformable to the regular flow of the preceding terms in the series*. The fourth section opens with the establishment of two propositions concerning * The syzygetic multipliers are identical with the numerators and denominators (expressed in their simplest form) of the successive colnvergents to the continued fraction which expresses 412 MR. SYLVESTER ON A THEORY OF THE CONJUGATE quadratic functions which are made use of in the sequel. Art. (28.) contains the proof of a law which, although of extreme simplicity, I do not remember to have seen, and with which I have not found that analysts are familiar: I mean the law of the constancy of signs (as regards the number of positive and negative signs) in any sum of positive and negative squares into which a given quadratic function admits of being transformed by substituting for the variables linear functions of the variables with real coefficients. This constant number of positive signs which attaches to a quadratic function under all its transformations, and which is a transcendental function of the coefficients invariable for -real substitutions, may be termed conveniently its inertia, until a better word be found. This inertia it is shown in art. (26.), by aid of a theorem identical with one formerly given by M. CAUCHY, is measured by the number of combinations of sign in the series of determinants of which the first is the complete determinant of the function; the second, the determinant when one variable is made zero; the next, the determinant when another variable as well as the first is made zero, and so on, until all the variables are exhausted, and the determinant becomes positive unity. In art. (46.) I give some curious and interesting expressions for the residues and syzygetic multipliers, under the form of determinants communicated to me by M. HERMIITE; and in art. (47.) I show how, by aid of the generating function which M. HERMITE employs, and of the law of inertia stated at the opening of the section, an instantaneous demonstration may be given of the applicability of my formula for M. STURM's functions for discovering the number of real roots offx, without any reference to the rule of common measure.; and moreover, that these formulae may be indefinitely varied, and give the generating function, out of which they may be evolved in its most general form. Had the law of inertia been familiar to mathematicians, this constructive and instantaneous method of finding formulae for determining the number of real roots within prescribed limits would, in all probability, have been discovered long ago, as an obvious consequence of such law. I then proceed in arts. (48.) and (49.), to inquire as to the nature of the indications afforded by the successive simplified residues to two general functions f and ,; and I find that the succession of signs of these residues serves to determine the number of roots off or p, comprised between given limits after all pairs of roots of either function, contained within the given limits, not separated by roots of the other function, have been removed, and the operation, if necessary, repeated toties quoties until no two roots of either function are left unseparated by roots of the other; or in other words, until every root finally retained in one function is followed by a root of the other, or else by one of the assigned limits. The system of roots comprised between given limits thus reduced I call the effective scale of intercalations; such a scale may begin with a root of the numerator or of the denominator of f; and upon this and the relative magnitudes of the greatest root of Ox and fx it will depend whether in the series of residues (among which tand r are for this purpose to be counted) RELATIONS OF TWO ALGEBRAICAL FUNCTIONS.' 413 changes will be lost or gained as x passes from positive infinity to negative infinity. In art. (50.) I observe that the theory of real roots of a single function given by M. STURM'S theorem is a corollary to this theory of the intercalations of real roots of two functions, depending upon the well-known law, that odd groups of the limiting function f'x lie between every two consecutive real roots of fx. In art. (51.) I verify the law of reciprocity, already stated to exist between the residues of fs and px, by an at posteriori method founded on the theory of intercalations. In arts. (52.), (53.), (54.), 1 obtain a remarkable rule, founded upon the process of common measure, for finding a superior and inferior limit in an infinite variety of ways to the roots of any given function. This method stands in a singular relation of contrast to those previously known. All previous methods (including those derived through NEWTON's Rule) proceed upon the idea of treating the function whose roots are to be limited as made up of the sum of parts, each of which retains a constant sign for all values of the variable external to the quantities which are to be shown to limit the roots. My method, on the other hand, proceeds upon the idea of treating the function as the product of factors retaining a constant sign for such values of the variable. In art. (55.), the concluding article of the fourth section, I point out a conceivable mode in which the theory of intercalations may be extended to systemsof three or more functions. In Section V. arts. (56.), (57.), I show how the total number of effective intercalations between the roots of two functions of the same degree is given by the inertia of that quadratic form which we agreed to term the Bezoutiant to f and A; 'and in the following article (58.) the result is extended to embrace the case contemplated in M. STURM'S theorem; that is to say, I show, that on replacing the function of x by a homogeneous function of x and y, the Bezoutiant to the two functions, -which are respectively the differential derivatives off with respect to x and with respect to y, will serve to determine by its form or inertia the total number of real roots and of equal roots inf (x). The subject is pursued in the following arts. (59.), (60.). The concluding portion of this section is devoted to a consideration of the properties of the Bezoutiant under a purely morphological point of view; for this purposef and p are treated as homogeneous functions of two variables x, y, instead of being regarded as functions of x alone. In arts. (61.), (62.), (63.), it is proved that the Bezoutiant is an invariantive function of the functions from which it is derived; dtud in art. (64.) the important remark is added, that it is an invariant of that particular class to which I have given the name of Combinants, which have the property of remaining unaltered, not only for linear transformations of the variables, but also for linear combinations of the functions containing the variables, possessing thus a character of double invariability. In arts. (65.), (66.), I consider the relation of the Bezoutiant to the differential determinant, so called by JACOBI, but which for greater brevity I call the Jacobian. On proper substitutions being made in the Bezoatiant of the (m) variables which it contains (m being the degree in x, y of f and p), the Bezoutiant becomes identical with the Jacobian to f and ?, but as it is afterwards 4,14 MR. SYLVESTER ON A THEORY OF THE CONJUGATE shown, this is not a property peculiar to the Bezoutiant; in fact there exists a whole family of quadratic forms of m variables, lineo-linear (like the Bezoutiant) in respect of the coefficients inf and A, all of which enjoy the same property. The number of individuals of such family must evidently be infinite, because any linear combination of any two of them must possess a similar property; I have discovered, however, that the number of independent formns of this kind is limited, being equal to the number of odd integers not greater than the degree of the two functions f and p. In arts. (67.) and (68.), I give the means of constructing the scale of forms, which I term the constituent or fundamental scale, of which all others of the kind are merely numericolinear combinations.. This scale does not directly include the Bezoutiant within it, and it becomes an object of interest to determine the numbers which connect the Bezoutiant with the fundamental forms; this calculation I have carried on (in arts. (69.), (70.)) (71.)) from m=1 to m=6 inclusive, and added an easy method of continuing indefinitely. In this method the numbers in the linear equation corresponding to any value of m are determined successively, and each made subject to a verification before the next is determined, there being always pairs of equations which ought to bring out the same result for each coefficient. In the next and concluding art. (72.), I remark upon the different directions in which a generalization may be sought of the subject-matter of the ideas involved in M. STUJRM'S: theorem, and of which the most promising is, in my opinion, that which leads through the theory of intercalations. Some of the theorems given by me in this paper have been enunciated by me many years ago, but the demonstrations have not been published, nor have they ever before been put together and embodied in that compact and organic order in which they are arranged in this memoir,-the fruit of much thought and patient toil, which I have now the honour of presenting to the Royal Society. June 16 1853. In a supplemental part to the third section I have given expressions in terms of the roots of px and fx for the quotients which arise in developing under the form of a continued fraction, and some remarkable properties concerning these quotients. In a supplemental part to the fourth section I have given an extended theory of mynew method offinding limits to the real roots of any algebraical equation. This method, so extended, po ssesses a m arked f eatu re of distinction f rom allt preced ing methods used f or the same purpose, inasmuch as it admits in every case of the limits being brought up into actual coincidence with the extreme roots, whereas in other methods a wide and arbitrary interval is in general necessarily left between the roots and the limits.

Each such complete residue will in general be of the form N., N. and D, being integral functions of the coefficients only of P and Q, but g, an integral function of these coefficients, and of x: p, may then be termed the ith simplified residue, and D' the tth allotrious factor. Suppose P to be of m and Q of n dimensions in x, and m-n-e, the process of continued division may be so conducted, that all the residues may contain only integer powers of x; and we may upon this supposition make MO of e dimensions, and M, MS, M,, &c. each of one dimension only in x; so that R1, R2, R3. will be respectively of (n1), (n-2), (n-3), &c. dimensions in x.

This error is corrected by my distinguished friend M. STURM (LIoUVILLE'S Journal, tom. viii. 1842. Sur un thdorbme d'Algebre de M.

UNDER THE FORM OF A CONTINUED FRACTION. 417 Art. (3.). This may be done by the following method, which is extremely simple, and would admit of a considerable extension in its applications, were it not beside my immediate purpose to digress from the objects set out in the title to the memoir, by entering upon an investigation of the special or singular cases which may arise in the process of forming the continued fraction, when one or more of the leading coefficients in any of the residues vanish; such an inquiry would require a more general character to be imparted to the values of the quotients and residues than I shall for my present purposes care to suppose. Let us begin with supposing e= 1, and write f= axn+bxn '+ CXn-2+ &c. l(6. P@vlx +P n-%2 + ryxn-3 + &C. IeXX Let 4 be the first residue of i and w of a, and therefore of ICY, so that w is the second f residue of Let w=X(Z), being entirely integer, and x. a function of the coefficients inf and p. N If we make X=D N and D being integer functions, D will evidently be L2; where L denotes the first coefficient in the simplified residue a2p, and is evidently of two dimensions in a, P, &c., and of one in a, b, &c.; Dw is therefore of 2 X 2+ 1, i. e. five dimensions in cz, f3, &c., and of two dimensions in a, b, &c.; but i (by virtue of what has been observed of the equations in system (5.)) is of three dimensions in a., 3, &c., and of two in a, b, &c. Hence N is of two dimensions in z, (, &c., and of none in a, b, &c. This enables us at once to perceive that N=a , for 4' is of the formf-(px+q)p, I and w is of the form p-(p'x+q)%. (7 But N=0 makes W vanish, and therefore, upon this supposition,f and p would appear to have a common algebraical factor '4, that is to say, N vanishing, would appear to in ply that the resultant of f and p must vanish, so that N would appear to be contained as a factor in this general resultant, which latter is, however, clearly indecomnposable into factors-a seeining paradox-the solution of which must be sought for in the fact, that the equation N=O is incompatible with the existence of the usual equations (7.) connecting f, p, 4' and w: but this failure of the existence of the equations (7.) (bearing in mind that N has been shown to be a function only of the set of coefficients a, i3, &c.), can only happen by reason of a vanishing whenever N vanishes; a must therefore be a root of N, or which is the same thing, N a power of (M) and hence N= o2.

It may, moreover, be noticed, that this remainder, when M2 has been expelled., will for general values of the coefficients be numerically as well as literally in its lowest UNDER'THE FORM OF A CONTINUED FRACTION. 419 terms, as evinced by the fact that there exist terms (ex.gr. aa2yE) having +1 for their numerical part. The same explicit method might be applied to show, that if the first divisor were e degrees instead of being only one degree in x lower than the first dividend, a e+1 would be contained in every term of the second residue; the difficulty, however, of the proof by this method augments with the value of e; but the same result springs as an immediate consequence from the method first given, which remains good mutatis mutandis for the general case, as may easily be verified by the reader. Applying now this result to the functions P and Q, supposed to be of the respective degrees n and n-e in x, and calling the coefficients of the leading terms in the successive simplified residues ml, a2l z&3, &c., and the leading coefficient in Q al, and before denoting the successive allotrious factors by i, X2, &c.) it will readily be seen that xle+l X2-Xl1 2 ,3 i x2 = as X4iX3= &c2 , 3 1 ~~e+1 2 e+1 2 ie Ae1+, I s a 2 X3= e+1 2 4a2 &2 g and in general 1 a2. a2 ... 2 ___ 1 e2m-, l e+ 2 4 2m_2 2 2 2~ 2ma I3 a3 a5*2mIJ Art.* (4.). Strictly speaking, we have not yet fully demonstrated that the complete allotrious factors are represented by the values above given for is but only that these latter are contained as factors in the allotrious factors; we must further prove that there exist no other such factors. This may be shown as follows: it is obvious from the nature of the process that the complete residues will always remain of one dimenision in respect of the given coefficients, i. e. first of one dimension in the set a, b, c, &c., and of zero dimensions in a, A, y, &c.; then conversely, of one dimension in . (3, r &c., and of zero dimensions in a, b1 c, &c., and so on, the residues being evidently required to conform in their dimensions to those of the first dividend and the first divisor alternately. These coefficients then are always of unit dimensions in respect to the given coefficients; whereas it has been shown (art. 2.) that the simplified residues in respect to these coefficients are successively of the dimensions 2+e, 4+e, 6+e, &c.

I proceed to show how the simplified residues may be most conveniently obtained by a direct process, identical with that which comes into operation in applying to the two given functions of x the method familiarly known under the name of BEZOUT'S abridged method of elimination. Let us call the two given functions U and V, and commence with the case where U and V are' of equal dimensions (n) in x. The simplified ith residue will then be a function of n-i dimensions in x, and of * dimensions in respect of each given set of coefficients, and may be taken equal to V,.U+U,.V, where V, and U, are each of (i1) dimensions in x.

For if we write the system of equations (I I.) under the general form 2,.U-H .V=A,,x-'+Bfx-'-1+ &c., the degree of So and H, in x will be that of Q-1 and P,__, i. e. i-I ; and the diniensions of A,, B., &c., in respect of each set of coefficients is evidently (i); consequently, by virtue of art.

Art. (6.). More generally, suppose U and V to be respectively of n+e and n ditensions in x. * V is supposed to be taken as the first divisor, and the term residue is used, as hitherto in this paper, throughout in the sense appertaining to the expansion conducted, so as to lead to an improper continued fraction, in that sense, in fact, in which it would, more strictly speaking, be entitled to the appellation of excess rather than that of residue. 422 MR.

By giving to m every integer value from 0 to (n-1) inclusive, we thus obtain n equations of the form of (12.), each of the degree n+e1 in x, and of one dimension in regard to each set of coefficients.

There will thus be (e) equations in which only the (b) set of coefficients appear, and (in) equations containing in every term one coefficient out of each of the two sets. The total number of equations is of course n+e. Between the (e) equations of the second system (13.) and the (r) occurring first in order of the first system (12.), we may eliminate dialytically the e+r1 highest powers of x, and there will thus arise an equation of the form 1U-lu+ar~ .V= Lx!"'t+ L' 1 +|&c. +L (14.), where O' and 0e+ri are respectively of the degrees rI and e+r1 in *., and L, L', ..

Every such square it is apparent may be conceived as a sort of sloped pyramid, formed by the successive superposition of square layers, which layers possess not merely a simple symmetry about a diagonal (such as is proper to a multiplication table), but the higher symmetry (such as exists in an addition table), evinced in all the terms in any line of terms parallel to the diagonal transverse to the axis of symmetry being alike*. Thus for n-5, the three layers or stages in question will be seen to be, the first(0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 5) (0.,3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 5) (2,5) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 5) (2, 5) (3, 5) (0, 5) (1, 5) (2, 5) (3, 5) (4, 5); the second(1, 2) (1, 3) (l, 4) (1, 3) (1, 4) (2, 4) (1, 4) (2, 4) (3, 4); and the third(2 3). In general, when (n) is odd, say 2p+ 1, the pyramid will end with a single term * A square arrangement having this kind of symmetry, viz. such as obtains in the so-called Pythagorean addition table as distinguished from that which obtains in the multiplication table, may be universally called Persymmetrie. UNDER THE FORM OF A CONTINUED FRACTION. 425 (p, (p+ 1)), and when even, as 2p, with a square of 4 terms, ((p-2), (p-1)) ((p-2) P) ((p-2), p), ((p-1),p). Each stage may be considered as consisting of three parts, a diagonal set of equal terms transverse to the axis of symmetry, and two triangular wings, one to the left, and the other to the right of this diagonal; the terms in each such diagonal for the respective stages will lbe (0, n); (1, n-1); (2, (n2-2)) * . . p, (pi+L)) p being 2-I when n is even, and when n is odd. 2~~~~~~~~~ If we change the order of the coefficients in each of the two given functions, it will be seen that the only effect will be to make the left and right triangular wings to change places, the diagonals in each stage remaining unaltered. The mode of forming these triangles is an operation of the most simple and mechanical nature, too obvious to need to be further insisted on here. Art. (8.). When we are dealing with two functions of unequal degrees, n and n+e, we can still form a square matrix with the coefficients of the two systems of (e) and (n) equations respectively, but this will no longer be symmetrical about a diagonal; it is obvious, however, that if we treat the function of the lower degree, as if it were of the same degree as the other function, which we may do by filling up the vacant places with terms affected with zero coefficients, the symmetry will be recovered; and it is somewhat important (as will appear hereafter) to compare the values of the 'Bezoutian secondaries as obtained, first in their simplest form by treating each of the two functions as complete in itself, and secondly, as they come out, when that of the functions, which is of the lower degree, is looked upon as a defective form of a function of the same degree as the other. A single example will suffice to make the nature of the relation between the two sets of results apparent. Take fx=a x4+b x'+cx2+dx+e pX=O . X4+ 0.X3 +rX2+X +?. The general method of art.

Hence it is apparent that the secondary Bezoutians obtained by the symmetrizing method will differ from those obtained by the unsymmetrical method by a constant factor a'; and so in general it may readily be shown that the secondary Bezoutians, by the use of the symmetrizing method, will each become affected with a constant irrelevant factor aw, where (co) is the difference of the degrees of the two functions, and (a) the leading coefficient of the higher one of the two. When (a) is taken unity, the Bezoutian secondaries, as obtained by either method, will of course be identical. Art. (9.). There is another method* of obtaining the simplified residues to anytwo functions U and V of the degrees n and n+e respectively, which, although less elegant, ought not to be passed over in silence. This method consists in forming the identical equations (of which for greater brevity the right-hand members are suppressed). V=&c. xV=&c. Xe .V=&c. U=&c. x e.V=&c. x.U-&c.

UNDER THiE FORM OF A CONTINUED FRACTION. 427 If we equate the right-hand members of (e+2:) of the above equations to zero, and then eliminate dialytically the several powers of x from Xn+e+*1 to xv''' (both inclusive), the result of this process will evidently be of (e+?) dimensions in respect of the coefficients in V, and of l dimensions in respect of the coefficients in U; and of the degree x.'7 in x it will also be of the form (A+Bx+ ...Lxe-l)U+(F+Gx+ ...+Qxe+-'), and by virtue of art. (2.) must consequently be the ith simplified residue to the system U, V. Art. (10.). The most general view of the subject of expansion by the method of continued division, consists in treating the process as having reference solely to the two systems of coefficients in U and V, which themselves ale to be regarded in the light of generating functions. To carry out this conception, we ought to write U-{0+a,.y+a2.y2+a y'+&c. ad inf. V = 6b0+b1..y+bf.y2+b~y3+&c. ad ijf., and might then suppose the process of successive division applied to U and V, so as to obtain the successive equations U -MV +R1=0 V -M2R,+R2=O R1-M3R2+R3=O &c. &c., M, M2, M,, &c. being each severally of any degree whatever in y, and in general the degree of y in M, being any given arbitrary function p (:) of :. The values of the coefficients of the residues R,, R R ..., or of these fortms simplified by the rejection of detachable factors, becomes then the distinct object of the inquiry, and will, of course, depend only upon the coefficients in P and Q and the nature of the arbitrary continuous or discontinuous function p(i), which regulates the number of steps through which each successive process of division is to be pursued.

If we take 2i, i. e. i pairs of the equations, the highest power of x appealing in any of them will be Xn+"-', and we shall be able to eliminate between them so as still to leave Xn+il-1(2i-1), i. e. Pi as before, the highest power of x remaining uneliminated; and it will be readily seen that suctlh of the simplified residues corresponding to this mode of development as occupy the odd places in the series of such residues, will be identical with the successive simplified residues resulting from the ordinary mode of developing V under the form of a continued fraction. Art. (11.). It has been shown that the simplified residues of fx and qx resulting from the process of continued division are identical in point of form with the secondary Bezoutians of these functions, but it remains to assign the numerical relations between any such residue and the corresponding secondary. To determine this numerical relation, it will of course be sufficient to compare the magnitude of the coefficient of any one power of x in the one, with that of the same power in the other; and for this purpose I shall make choice of the leading coefficients in each. In what follows, and throughout this paper, it will always be understood that in calculating the determinant corresponding to any square the product of the terms situated in the diagonal descending fromn left to right will always be taken with the positive sign, which convention will serve to determine the sign of all the other products entering into such determinant.

The residue next following, obtained by actually performing the division and duly changing the sign of the remainder will be {(e-C (B/ Bg X+ &c., which is of the form ]rB'M-ACC12}x-2 + &c. Thus the leading coefficients in the complete unreduced residues will be A; B'; B 'M-AC'2 and when reduced by the expulsion of the allotrious factor will become A; B'; B'.M-A C'2, and consequently, when B' the leading coefficient of one of the simplified residues vanishes, the leading coefficients of the residues immediately preceding -and following that one will have contrary signs. First, let fx=axn+bxn-+&c., px=aX'n+Pxe-+&c. As regards the numerical ratio of each Bezoutian secondary to the corresponding simplified residue, it has been already observed that there are always unit coefficients in the latter of these, and the same is obviously true of the former; hence if we call the progression of the leading coefficients of the simplified residues RI; R2, R; R4,&. and that of the leading coefficients of the Bezoutian secondaries B1, B2; B,; B4, &c., we have B=I?+RI B2=+R2 B3=+R, B4=+R4, &c. It may be proved by actual trial that B-=RI and B -R . Moreover, since the signs are invariable, and do not depend upon the values of the coefficients, we may suppose B,=0 (which may always be satisfied by real values of the quantities, of which B2 is a function); we shall also, therefore, have R2=0, and consequently B, has the opposite sign to that of B,, and R, the opposite sign to that of RI, which is equal to B1; hence when B =0, B, and R, are equal, and consequently are always equal; in like manner we can prove that R4 and B4 have the same sign when R. and B, vanish, and consequently are always equal, and so on ad libitum, which proves that the series B1, B2, ... B. is identical with the series R1, R2, R..,, and consequently that the Bezoutian secondaries are identical in form, magnitude and algebraical sign with the simplified residues. Secondly, when fx and OPx are not of the same degree, it has been shown that the secondaries formed fr~om the rnonMDCCCLIII. 3 L 432 MR. SYLVESTER ON THE RESIDUES OF EXPANDED symmetrical matrix corresponding to this case will be the same as those formed from the symmetrical matrix corresponding to fx and (I(x) (where <)x is @(S) treated by aid of evanescent terms, as of the same degree asfv), with the exception merely of a constant multiplier (a power of the leading coefficient of fx) being introduced into each secondary. By aid of this observation, the proposition established for the case of two functions of the same degree may be readily seen to be capable of being extended, from the case of f and p being of the equal dimensions in x, to the general case of their dimensions being any whatever. Art. (13.). Before closing this section, it may be well to call attention to the nature of the relation which connects the successive residues of fx and px with these functions themselves, and with the improper continued fractional form into which fZ is supposed to be developed in the process of obtaining these residues. If px be of n degrees, andfx of n+e degrees in (n), we shall have at 1 1 1 1 ft QIq2q3qn where Q. may be supposed to be a function of x of the degree (e), and q2, q3, ... are all linear functions of x; the total number of the quotients Q1, q2 . .. qn being of course (n) when the process of continued division is supposed to be carried out until the last residue is zero. Upon this supposition the last but one residue is a constant, the preceding one a function of x of the first degree, the one preceding that a function of x of the second degree, and so on. Let us call the residue of the degree A in vr, En; it will readily be seen that the successive complete residues arranged in an ascending order will be 5o) 2Soqnl5 O(ynI Iqn -1), SO(qn-2. ?-qI-loin qn2 qn);&. being in the ratios of the quantities 1; qn; qn-1-; qn.2-&c. qn ~~q7;qn Again, we shall have in general Aj,.-L =, . . . . .. (15.) A, being an integral function of x of the degree n-i1, and L, an integral function of x of the degree (n+e) -1 ; and it is easy to see that the successive convergents to the continued fraction1 1 1 Qlq2q3have their respective numerators and denominators identical with those of the fractions An_, An-2 An-3 &c LL L &c n-1 n-2 n-3 Adopting the language which I have frequently employed elsewhere, I call A. a .UNDER THE FORM OF A CONTINUED FRACTION. 433 syzygetic function, or more briefly, a conjunctive of f and p, and A, and L, may be termed the syzygetic factors to 2, so considered. If we divide each term of the equation (15.) by the allotrious factor (M), we have -'fM= RI) A where Ri is the mth simplified residue to (f, p); and if we call M= l,, and L=t1, so as to obtain the equation r,.f t,.iR,, o .R.I.). * * * * * (16.) we see that -? the fraction formed by the component factors to any simplified residue of (f, p), will be identical in value (although no longer in its separate terms) with one of the corresponding convergents to P exhibited under the form of an improper continued fraction. I shall in the next section show how, not only the successive simplified residues, but also the component syzygetic factors of each of them, and consequently the successive convergents, may be expressed in terms of the roots of the two given functions. Since the preceding section was composed the valuable memoir of the lamented JACOBI, entitled "De Eliminatione Variabilis e duabus Equationibus Algebraicis," CRELLE, vol. xvi., has fallen under my notice. That memoir is restricted to the consideration of two equations of the same degree, and the principal results in this section as regards the Bezoutic square and the allotrious factors applicable to that case wvill be found containeds therein. The mode of treatment however is sufficiently dissimilar to justify this section being preserved unaltered under its original form. SECTION IH. On the general solution in terms of the roots of any two given algebraical functions of x of the syzygetic equation, which connects them with a third function, whose degree in (x) is given, but whose form is to he determined. Art. (14.). Letf and p be two given functions in x of the degrees m and n respectively in x, and for the sake of greater simplicity let the coefficients of the highest power of x in f and p be each taken unity, and let it be proposed to solve the syzygetic equation (17.) where A, is given only in the number of its dimensions in x, which I suppose to be (i); but the forms of a,, t,, A, are all to be determined in terms of hl, h2 . .. htm the roots of f and n,, /2~ ... 7n the roots of p.

Hence the whole sum of terms in (22.) which is made up of such pairs of terms, and of other terms in which E1-E2 does not enter, remains finite when E1-E2=O, and therefore generally when D= 0, and similarly when H1 H2=O, and therefore also when A-_0; hence the expression for 2 in (22.) is an integral function of the E and H series of quantities, as was to be proved.

Art. (18.). I shall now demonstrate that every form in this scale (to a numerical factor pres) is identical with a simplified residue to f, p of the same degree * in x. Any such simplified residue is like %, a syzygetic function, or to use a briefer form of speech, a conjunctive of f, p; and if we agree to understand by the " weight" of any function of the coefficients of f and p its joint dimensions in respect of the roots of f and p combined, I shall prove,st, that any simplified residue off and P of a given degree in x is that conjunctive, whose weight in respect of the roots off and p is less than the weight of any other such conjunctive; and 2nd, that 5,, as determined above (in equation 24.), is of the same weight as the simplified residue, and can therefore only differ from it by some numerical factor. For the purpose of comparison of weights, it will of course be sufficient to confine our attention to the coefficients of the highest (or any other, the same power, for each) in x of the forms whose weights are to be compared.

From this we infer that any conjunctive off and p of the degree i, of which the leading coefficient is of the weight (m-.:)(n-i) (all the coefficients being of course understood to be integral functions of the roots of f and P), must, to a numerical factor pros, be equivalent to any other of the same weight; and furthermore, any supposed function of x of the ith degree which possesses the property characteristic of a conjunctive of vanishing, whenf and p vanish simultaneously, but of which the weight of the leading coefficient would be less than (m-:)(n--), must be a mere nugatory form and have all its terms identically zero*. Art. (21.). We have previously shown, art. (16.), that 5', as defined by equation (21.), is an integral function of the rootsf and p, and vanishes whenf and p vanish. Moreover, its weight in the roots has been proved to be (m-*)(n--), and consequently, if by way of distinguishing the several forms of A we name that one where s in the equation above cited is supposed to be divided into two parts, v and P, a,, we have for all values of v and P, such that v+v is not greater than n, a, to a constant numerical factor pres identical with the (v+v)th simplified residue to (f, A), so that the form of k,, depends only upon the value of v+v. Art. (22.). It must be well borne in mind that this permanency of the value of av,_v for different values of v has only been established for the case where i can be the degree of a residue tof and p, that is to say, when i is less than the lesser of the two indices m and n. When i does not satisfy this condition of inequality, the theorem ceases to be true. It is clear that when m=n and v+>=mr=n, a," which always remains a conjunctive off and p, can only be a numerical linear function off and p; and I have ascertained when m=n on giving to v and v the respective values successively (0, n), (1, n-1), (2, (n-2)), ...

(23.). The expression S, , which is universally a conjunctive of f and A continues algebraically interpretable so long as v+v has any value intermediate between (0) and m+n; when v+v=O, we must of course have v=O and v=0, and S, o becomes the resultant off and p when v+v-=n+n; we must also have the unique solution v-m and v n, and 2>n becomes necessarilyfx A, which we thus see stands in a so' t of antithetical relation to the resultant off and A, say (f, p). Nor is it without interest to remark thatfx p=-O implies that a root off or else of P is zero; and (f, p)=0 implies that if a root of the one of the functions is zero, so also is a root of the other, i. e. that a root of each or of neither is zero. As i increases from 0 to n or decreases from m+n to mI, the number of solutions of the equation v+v=i in the one case, and the number of admissible solutions of the equation v+v=i in the other case, which is subject to the condition that v must not exceed n, continues to increase by a unit at each step; there being thus n+1 different forms SvV when v+v=n, and the same number when v+v=n1. For all values of i intermediate between n and (mi1) (both taken exclusively) it is very remarkable that av, will vanish, as I proceed to demonstrate. Art. (24.). The weight of the coefficient of the highest power of a, (v+v being equal to i) is (m-i)(n-i), and consequently, when i is greater than n, and less than m, a," would contain fractional functions of the roots off and p, if there were in it a power xc, but a, has been proved to be always an integer function of the roots. Hence the coefficient of x' will be zero, and so more generally the first power of x in 2u, , of which the coefficient is not zero, will be xar subject to the condition (since evidently the weight of the several coefficients goes on increasing by units as the degree of the terms in c decreases by the same) that X be not less than (m.-i)(i-n); let then = (m-i) (i-n), , becomes of the form Axcc0+Bxc-`-+ &c., where A is of zero dimensions; but this is impossible if i-x<n, for then Acc-k'+ &c. is a conjunctive of 444 MR.

Moreover, when i=m-1, w=i-n, and i-c=n, and accordingly v, mfi-i is not merely, as we mnight know, a priori an algebraical, but more simply a numerical multiple of p for all values of v. The same is of course true also, m being greater than n, for every form v, ,,,,, since this is always a conjunctive of f and , of which the former is of a degree higher than the a in question, so that the multiplier off in this conjunctive must be zero*. Art. (25.). To enter into a further or more detailed examination of the values assumed by 2v, for the most general values of m, n, i, would be to transcend the limits I have proposed to myself in drawing tip the present memoir. What we have established is, that to every form of F -,i appertaining to a value of i between 0 and n, there is a sort of conjugate form for which i lies between m+n and rn; that for i=mI or i=n, S becomes a numerical multiplier of p; and that when i lies in the intermediate region between n and mi, av,-v vanishes for all values of v.

(27.). The method employed in the preceding investigation will enable us to affix the proper sign and numerical factor to a'O,i or ,0, or in general to a, i, in order that it may represent the Bezoutian secondary of the degree i in x. [This latter has been already identified with the simplified residue obtained by expanding 7X under the form of an improper continued fraction.] For this purpose, it will be sufficient to compare a single term of any such with the corresponding one in the S~ymmrorphic Bezoutian secondary. Let us first suppose that rnzn, f and 50 being of MDUCCLIII. 3 N 448 MR. SYLVESTER ON THE RESIDUES AND SYZYGET'IC MULTIPLIERS To O x, fx the same degree. A glance at the form of the Bezoutian square will show that if we form the Bezoutian secondary of the degree (n-i) in x, the coefficient of its leading term will contain the term (_)(i1)3 (0, (i) as usual denoting the product of the coefficient of OX in f bv the coefficient of x"-' in p, less the product of the coefficient of n in p by that of x in f; and as we suppose the first coefficients in f and p to be each 1, if we term the other coefficients last spoken of a, and oti respectively, this said coefficient of the leading term of the ith. Bezoutian secondary will contain the term ( and consequently ()(i1) . and (-_)i 2'at. Now by the lilke reasoning as that employed in the preceding article, the coefficient of the leading term in i. e. rh 17hq2. -hqil (x -hq,+ ) (xhq+2) *(,Vhqn)r 41 A2 "w 7M q1 q2 q Lhqj+, lqi2 l , hqM j will contain the quantity 1(h,.h,.h...hj)i and therefore will contain a tern (E (. h. h30..h) i. e. (-)iia', which is equal to (-)a since (i-l )i is always even. Hence %-io (-)' 2 x the corresponding Bezoutian secondary. Art. (28.). The above applies to the case where we have supposed m=n. When this equality does not exist we may proceed as follows. Prefix to p(x), the first coefficient of which is still supposed to be 1, a term s-xm, where s is positive and indefinitely small, and let 9x so augmented be called (D(x.). Then if klk2...k. are the roots of px, klk2...k., together with the (m-n) values of (E) n will be the roots of <v(x). But it has already been proved that when (as here supposed) the first coefficient offx is 1, the Bezoutian secondaries tofand p will be identical with those tof and PD respectively; at least it has been proved that these latter, when ?=0, but the form of PD is preserved, become identical with the former, and consequently the same is true when e is taken indefinitely small.

Art. (29.). If now we return to the syzygetic equation, a.f-to+S=O, a may be treated as known, having in fact been completely determined as a function of the roots, as well in its most general form, as also so as to represent the simplified residues tof and p in the preceding articles; it remains to determine the values of 'r and t as functions of the roots corresponding to any allowable form of a, but I shall confine the investigation to the case where a is the lowest-weighted conjunctive, or which is the same thing, a simplified residue to t and p of any given degree in x; each value of 'r will then represent one of the convergents to / when expanded under the form tf of a continued fraction. If 2 be of the ith degree in x, 'r is of the degree (n-i1) and t of the degree (rn-i-i).

If, on the other hand, P be taken of less than vy dimensions in h and k, we know 'a priori that ,,, , must vanish, as otherwise we should have a conjunctive of a weight less than the minimum weight. When P is of the proper amount of weight vv, it is I think probable that another condition as to the distribution of the weight will be found to be necessary in order that a,, may not vanish, viz. that the highest power of any single (h) in P shall not exceed v, nor the highest power of any single X7 exceed v. But as I have not had leisure to enter upon the inquiry, the verification or disproval of this supposed law, and more generally the evolution of the allotrious numerical factor introduced into Se, by assigning any particular form to (P) satisfying the necessary conditions of amount and distribution of weight, must be reserved, amongst other points connected with the theory of the remarkable forms (19.) art.

A property of continued fractions, which, if known, I have not met with in any treatise on the subject (but which has been already cursorily alluded to in these pages), gives rise to a remarkable property of reciprocity connecting X and t severally with a in the syzygetic equation 'f-tp+a=O.

On the application of the Theorems in the preceding Section to the expression in terms of the roots of any primitive function of STURM'S auxiliary functions, and the other functions which connect these with the primitive function and its first diffrrential derivative. Art. (35.). The formulke in the preceding Section had reference to the case of two absolutely independent functions and their respective systems of roots: when the functions become so related that the roots of the one system become explicitly or implicitly functions of the roots of the other system, the formulae will become expressible in terms of these latter alone, and in some cases the terms (of which the sum is always essentially integral) will become separately and individually representable under an integral form. Such, as I shall proceed to show, is the case for two functions, of which one is the differential derivative of the other. Whenf and @ are MR.

STURM'S auxiliary functions in terms of the roots of the primitive, and which I therein stated were immediately deducible from the general formulhe (also enunciated in the same paper) applicable to any two functions. These more general formulae appear to have completely escaped the notice of M. STURM and others who have used the special formulae applicable to the case of one function becoming the first differential derivative of the other. Art. (36.). In precisely the same manner, if we form as usual the ordinary syzygetic equation we may find the different values of t given by the complementary formulke; and using t to denote the multiplier of the degree i in x, i. e. appertaining to the residue of the degree (m-i1) in x, we have L1q q2 qi ( )X )(h -71 772 **54M1.

Hence it follows thatf'(x) might be used instead of fx, to produce, by the Sturmian process of common measure, a series of auxiliary functions, which with fx and f,'.x would form a rhizoristic series, i. e. a series for determining (as in the manner of M. STURM'S ordinary auxiliaries) the number of real roots of fx comprised within given limits. The rhizoristic series generated by this process will, it is easily seen, be (to a constant factor preos) the denominators (reckoning +1 as the denominator in the zero place) of the successive convergents to T thrown under the form of a continued fraction M. STURM's own rhizoristic series, on the contrary (will q1q2-q-, q be to a constant factor pr&s), the denominators of the convergents to the iverse fraction which will be of the form K.accordingly these two MR. SYLVESTER ON FORMULXE RELATING TO STURM'S THEOREM. 459 rhizoristic series will be equivalent as regards the number of changes and of combinations of sign (afforded byeach) corresponding to any given value of x, of which of course the q's are linear functions. This result agrees with what has been demonstrated by me by a more general method (in the London and Edinburgh Philosophical Magazine, June and July 1853), where it has been proved, by means of a very simple theorem of determinants, that the two series 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 q, q1q2qLq2q3 q,q2q3 qn and 1' 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 qn qanqn-1 i nqnI qn-2 qn qn-1qn-2 ql always contain (for real values of qj, q2, q3...qn) the same number of positive and negative signs. Art. (38.). Having now determined the general values of 2 and t in the equation tf'(x) -rfx+2=O as explicit integral functions of the roots of fx, the more difficult task remains to assign to T its value similarly expressed. This cannot readily be effected by means of substitutions in the general formule, the method we adopted for finding t and ,; but all the other quantities except r in the syzyzetic equation being integral functions of the roots, it is evident that fl also must be an integral function of the same, and to obtain it we may use the expression x= tfx -. To obtain the general form of 'r by direct calculation from this formula would however be found to be impracticable; the mode I adopt therefore to discover the general expression for l corresponding to different values of 5, is to ascertain its value on the hypothesis of particular relations existing between the roots of fx, and then from the particular values of Xr thus obtained to infer demonstratively its general form, as will be seen below. The demonstration of r is unavoidably somewhat long, 'r being in fact represented by a double sum of partial symmetrical functions. Using the subscript indices of each function as the syzygetic equation to denote its degree in x, we have in general tm i ifIX-fm-i-2fX+ =i Q where if we make l -x =k1 h2 -=k2. h_--k so that hi-h.=ki -k and therefore (hoI h02.. .hp) =(k6, k02. kop) we have in effect found hi KN(kq1.kq2,. kqi) (kq+I kq 2.kq) and wm have a+(kqo k1 k2.kmi kq2 qm-i-) 460 MR.

This relationship between the different k's corresponding to a multiplicity 3 may arise in different ways; the multiplicity 3 may be divided into 3 units corresponding to 3 pairs of equal roots, or into 2 and 1 corresponding one set of 3 equal roots, and a second set of 2 equal roots, or may be taken "en bloc" which corresponds to the case of one set of 4 equal roots. I shall make the first of these suppositions, which will sufficiently well answer our purpose in the case before us. Thus I shall suppose k =k4 k2= kk5 k3=k6, then, as above remarked, (kq3 kq4 kq5 kq6 kq,7) =0 for all values of q3 q4 q5 q6 q7, and therefore Ykql kq2,(kq, kq4 kq5 kq6 kq7)=0; also lkql kq2 kq3 kq4 kq5 kq6 becomes k, k2 k3 (kj. k2.k3+2k7.k, k2+k, k3 + k23 k), and Q4(qj 2q21q3 q q4) vanishes, except for the cases where q1 q2 q3 q4 represent respectively, q1 the index 1 or 4, q2 the index 2 or 5, q3 the index 3 or 6, and q4 the index 7. Hence 2kql kq2 kq3 kq4$(kq, kq2 kq3 kq4) =23ki k2k3k74(k k2k3k7), and consequently r, becomes ?84(k1 k2k3k7) X {kj k2k,+2k(k1 k2+kl k3+k2k3)} Hence we are able to predict that the general expression for our 'r in the case before us will be f(k 3+ kq+k 3)-(k2 +k 2+k 4)(k l+kq +kq+ k 7+k q I ar = { C (k k2 kq7kq7) x + (k 4 + k75 + kq7) (kqj * kq2 + kqj, .kq73 + kq kq7 + k .2 kq3 + kq . kq7 + kq -k 7) k4k(kql kq2 kq3+kql kq2 kq7+kql kq3 kq7+kq2 kq3.kq7) J For in the first place, the fact that the 'r vanishes when more than three relations of equality exist between the k's, proves that we may assume 3 of the form E{4(kq, kq2 kq3 kq1) X p{kql kq2 kq3 kq7; kq4 kq5kq6}, the semicolon (;) separating the P's into two groups, in respect of each of which severally p is a symmetrical form.

Consequently the sum of the terms constituting the second factor in the above expression =(3-4)k*.k* k3+(2-4)k7(k, k + k, *A+k2 *23) H-ence the above expression becomes ?18t(kj k2 k3 k7) {kl .k2 k3+2(k, k,+kl k3+k2 k3)k} Thus, then, whenever *k k2k3 are respectively equal to any three of the quantities *4k6*k,7, which may take place in twenty-four different ways { twenty-four being the number of permutations of four things}, our 73 will have been correctly assumed; but t(kq kqg, kq:, kq;f) being replaceable by t(hq, hq3 h, Iq7), the r3 may be treated as a cubic function in ki, k* k3,* and arranged according to the powers of k,*3 will contain only twenty terms; hence, since the assumed form is verified for more than twenty, i. e. for twenty-four values of h, h2, hI,, it follows that the assumed form is universally identical with the form of 7, which was to be determined. Art. (40.). Now, again, in order to facilitate the conception of the general proof, let us suppose fx to be of only five dimensions in x, i still remaining 3: it will no longer be possible when we suppose a multiplicity three to prevail aynonig the roots, to conceive this multiplicity to be distributed into three parts, for that would require the existence of three pairs of roots, tnere being only five. But we may, if we please, make 1t=h,=h,, and h4=h,, or else AI1=h,=It,=ho, or in any other mode conceive the multiplicity to be divided into two parts, 2 and 1 respectively, or to be taken collectively "Cen bloc.' As a mode of proceeding the more remote from that last employed, I shall choose the latter supposition. 'Then we obtain (7 now becoming r5-2, i. e. 7l) ki k2 k3*k4*k, .r = + q *kq, kq4>x { Ekql kq(kq kq2)}, and t(kq kq,) will vanish, except in the case where q, represent the indices 1 or 2 or 3 or 4, and q2 the index 5; also i*kq kQ, kq*4=kq*+4k3k Hence our equation becomes *U.*,.kJ + (k* J+4* k*,)4k*.*As(k, ks), and 7 becomes _4 tkl ks) (k + 4kr). If, now, we assume for the general value of 7 in the case before us 7=1t(*q, *q,) { (*q+*q3+ k*q4)-4(*ql+ k)}, when k*=*k,=k4, 7l becomes +4t(k kcc) 3kc-(4k,+kL) 464 MR. SYLVESTER ON FOR.MULL RELATING TO STURM S THEOREM. Hence then for the two systems of values of h/ h2 h,, viz. hi= h4 hi=h, h2= h4 or h2=h, h3= h4 h3=h5, the form of 'r will have been correctly assumed. But since the derived form is a linear function of h1, h2, hI, this is not enough to identify the assumed with the general form, since for such verification four systems of values must be taken, four l)eing the number of terms in a function of three variables of the first degree. If, however, we had adopted, a separation of the multiplicity three into two parts, and had started with supposing k,=k2=k, k_-k_, we should have found that r would have become =64(ki, k5)(2kj+3k5). Moreover, when these equalities subsist, k, k2k, k4+kl k2k3k,+kl k2k4k,, +k, k k4k, +k2k3 k kk becomes 2k1 k,+3k2.kl, and the common factor k2.k4 disappears in the course of the operations for finding ', and eventually we have to show (in order to support the universality of the previously assumed form for 7z) that 7q,+4q3+81q4" 4lQ8q1 +72q) 1ecomes -3;7 when )q7q3 74I and 7'q4 '1q5 45 which is evidently true. 1lHence then T will have been correctly assumed for the following cases, k1_k2-k,=k4; and also for the cases kl=k2=k, and k2=k4 k=k 5=k, and k2=k4 k2 =k, r a~nd klflk4J k1-k2=k4 and k,=k3 k1=k5-=k4 and A2 k3 I k2=k, k4 and kl=k3j i. e. for eight cases in all, whereas four only would have sufficed. Hence, 6ex abundantia demonstrationis," the form assumed for r, is in the case before us the general form. Art. (41.).

Supplement to SECTION 1Il. On the Q2uotients resulting from the process of continuous division ordinarily applied to two Alo-ebraical Functions in order to determine their greatest Common Measure. [Received October 20, 1853.] Art. (a.)* We have now succeeded in exhibiting the forms of the numerators and denominators offs developed into a continued fraction in terms of the differences of the roots and factors offx. It remains to exhibit the quotients themselves of this continued fraction under a similar form. Lemmna.-An equation being supposed of an arbitrary degree n, there exists no function of n and of less than 2i of the coefficientsf, which vanishes for all values of n whenever the n roots reduce in any manner to i distinct groups of equal roots; or in other words, anyfunction of n and the first 2i1 coefficients of an equation of the nth degree, which vanishes for all values of n in every case where the roots retain only i distinct names, must be identically zero. To render the statement of the proof more simple, let i be taken equal to 3. And let the roots be supposed to reduce to p roots a,, q roots b, and r roots c. And let sX in general denote the sum of the rth powers of the roots. Then we have evidently p +q +r =s, pa +qb +rc =s, pa'+ qb'+rc=s, pa3+ qb3+rc'= s, pa4?+qb4+rc4=s4, &c. &c., ad infinitum. Eliminating p, q, r between the first, second, third and fourth equations, wve obtain a2 b2 C2 S2 a3 b3 C3 s3 * The articles in this and subsequent sections to which Latin or Greek letters are prefixed, although in strict connexion with the context, are supplementary in the sense of having been. supplied since the date. when the paper was presented for reading to the Royal Society. All the articles marked with numbers (from 1 to 72), and the Introduction, appeared in the memoir as originally presented to the Society, June 16, 1853. t In the proposition thus enunciated the coefficient of the highest ,power ~f x is supposed to bie a numerical quantity. 468 ON A THEOREM CONCERNING EQUATIONS HAVING EQUAL ROOTS. In like manner eliminating ap, bq, cr between the second, third, fourth and fifth equations, we have .. ~~~~~~1 1 1 8, a2 b2 c' s a3 b3 C3 8 and so in general we have for all values of e, a b C Sel be+i 8:+2 a3 b c's e+3 whence it may immediately be deduced, that, upon the given supposition of there being only three groups of distinct roots, we must have the following infinite system of coexisting equations satisfied, viz.s~t+slu+s2v+sw=O say LoO= slt+s2u+s3v+s4w=O L1=0 s~t+s~u+s4v+s~w=0 L -o 82t+S4u+s4V+SIW=0 L2 =0 83t +S4U ,+85V +86W-? L3=0 s4t~s~u+sfsv~s7w= ?' L_-0 &c. &C. &C. &c, and conversely, when this infinite system of equations is satisfied the roots must reduce themselves to three groups of equal roots. Let now @ be any function of so 81 s2 ... se, which vanishes when this is the case. rrhen p must necessarily contain as a factor some derivee of the infinite system of equations above written, i. e. some function of s, s, s2, &c., which vanishes when these equations are satisfied; i. e. some conjunctive of the quantities LL L, L2L3 ; but it is obviously impossible in any such conjunctive to exclude s8 from appealing, unless by introducing some other s with an index higher than 6, and consequently 0 cannot be metely a function of so Si s2 s3 s4 s5, nor consequently of n, and the first five coefficients; ot if such1, it is identically zero, and so in general any function of n, and only 2i1 of the coefficients, which vanishes when the roots reduce to i groups of equal ioots, must be identically zero, as was to be ptoved . Art. (b.) It ought to be observed that the pt-ecedling reasoning depends essentially upon the circumstance of n being leftfarbitrat-y. If n were given the proposition would no longer be true. In fact, on that supposition, the n roots teducing to i distinct roots would imply the existence of n.-i conditions between the n i-oots; and consequently n-i independent equations would subsist between the n coefficients, and functions could be formed of i only of the coefficients, which would satisfy the prescribed condition of vanishing when the roots resolvred thlemselvres into i groups of distinct identities.

Now obviously the necessary and sufficient conditions in order that the n 'roots may consist of only repetitions of i distinct roots is, that R. shall be identically zero, that is to say, we must have DI,2, . i-O D2,3. i+1=0........... D7iOn.i l But the reasoning of the preceding article shows that although these equations are necessary and sufficient, they are but a selected system of equations of an infinite number of similar equations which subsist*, and that, in fact, whatever be the value of (n), we may take r, r2...Ir perfectly arbitrary and as great as we please, and the equation Drr2 ... .ri0 must exist by virtue of the existence of the n-i equations last above written. Art. (d.) I now return to the question of expressing the successive quotients off as functions of the differences of the roots and factors; that they must be capable of being so expressed is an obvious consequence of the fact, that the numerators and denominators of the convergents have been put under that form, since if N2i-2 Ni_1 Ni D,_2' Di-' Di are any three consecutive convergents of the continued fraction 1 1 1 Q1Q2Q.. we must have Di_2. Nz-Ni2.Dj-QjIt would not, however, be easy to perform the multiplications indicated in the above equation, so as to obtain Qi under its reduced form as a linear function of x.

If the process of obtaining the successive quotients and residues be considered, it will easily be seen that each step in the process imports two new coefficients into the quotients, the first quotient containing no literal quotient in the part multiplying x and containing the first literal coefficient in the other part, the second quotient containing two literal coefficients in the one part and three in the other, and in general the ith quotient containing 2i-2 of the letters in the one part and 2i1 of them in the other. Hence T, being made equal to Li.x+Mi, Li contains 2i-2 and Mi contains 2i1 of the literal coefficients of fx. Moreover, we have Zi of the form Tj2. ip2 where Pi1=1(h, hk20..2.kho)40il0+2, * * 'i0.n Pi.2=1t(hel h0 ...1h0.__)40, 4io 1. *.on, * it will be remembered is the symbol of the operation of taking the product of the squares of the differenoes of the-quantities which it governs. f'S OF L UNDER THE FORM OF AN IMPROPER CONTINUED FRACTION. 471 flu and Pi, which is the ith simplified residue, vanishes when the n roots in any manner become reduced to only i distinct groups.

It will be observed that Ai, e is identical with what the simplified denominator of the (iI)th convergent becomes when we write he in place of x, and consequently, when arranged according to the powers of he, will be of the form Ci.hei-l+CO hei-2+ ... +Ci where c1, c2, ... ci are functions of the coefficients, but containing no more of them than enters into Qi~, i. e. containing only 2i -2 of them. Now Ai is made up of terms, each consisting of some binary product of Cl, C2, .., Ci combined with somte term of the series h2i-2 h2i-3 Eh and any one of this latter set of terms expressed as a function of the coefficients of ft contains at most 2i-2 of them. Hence only 2i-2 of the coefficients enter into Ai, and in like manner only 2iI of them into Bi. The number of letters, therefore, in Ai and in Bi is the same as in Li and in Mi, viz. 2i-2 and 2i1 respectively. Now let the roots consist of only i distinct groups of equal roots, so that T, P'2i-2 becomes i@Pi i* I shall show that in whatever way the equal roots are supposed to be grouped upon this supposition, there will result the equation -Ti =Ui, Pi-2 where To (401402 noi)}2@ PPi-2= >W 0i 0il 1.. *0 * (40 4( 0, ad 4i-1)} Pi_ ! : {4best1 40i+2-** tn4(nol t02 * * * noi) }a and Hi=Al.n1+A2. 2+... +An.'in, Ae meaning E (ne 01) (neno) * * * ( ~) ;(no, ote * *oi} and ,0 meaning xho,.

Hence, therefore, Uj-Tj vanishes whenever the roots of fx contain only i distinct groups of equal roots, and it has been shown that Uj and Tj each contain only 2iI of the coefficients offx, so that Uj-Tj is a function only of n and these 2i1 letters, and consequently by virtue of the Lemma in Art. (a.) Uj-Tj is universally zero, i. e. UJJ is identical with Ti, as was to be proved, In the same manner as observed in a preceding marginal note, the expression given in the antecedent articles for the numerator of the ith convergents having been verified for the case of the roots consisting of only i distinct groups, could have been at once inferred to be generally true by aid of the Lemma above quoted.

(h h2I...h.), which arises from the circumstance of the last divisor, which is the final Stur mian residue, not containing x; it being evidently the case that the division 3 Q2 474 MR. SYLVESTER ON THE QUOTIENTS RESULTING FROM THE EXPANSION of a rational function of x by another one degree lower, introduces into the integral part of the quotient the square of the leading coefficient of the divisor, subject to the exception that when the divisor is of the degree zero, the simple power enters in lieu of the square. The general formula gives for the reduced nth quotient the expression 2E ftl-K2hl-h3....hl-h.4(h2 h3*h2(X l t which equals ~(hl h2 .. . hb) 14(h2A h... h.A) ( -A h).Rejecting the first factor, we have Et(h2 h,... h.)

We may by means of this identity, differentiating any number of times with respect to x both sides of the equation, obtain analogous expressions for the series (a-1 1)t+Z_ + + But to do this we must be in possession of a rule for the differentiation of continued fractions whose quotients are linear functions of the variable. I subjoin here the first step only toward such investigation. Let the denominator of 1 1 1 q,q2qn. where q, q,...q,. are any n arbitrary quantities, be denoted by [q1, q2, q3...qn], so that the entire fraction will be equal to [q2 q3 ... qn] [qlq2q3.-.qn]] any such quantity as [qi qill .. .qJ may be termed a Cumnulant, of which qi, q+ .. .q. may be severally termed the elements or Components, and the complete arrangement of the elements -may be termed the Type. The cumulant corresponding to any Type remains unaffected by the order of the elements in the Type being reversed, as is evident from any cumnulant being in fact r epr esentable under the formn of a symmretrical determinant) OF J UNDER THE FORM OF AN IMPROPER CONTINUED FRACTION. 475 thus ex. gr. the cumulant [q, q2 q3 q4] may be represented by the determinant q1 1 0 0 1 q2 1 0 0 1 q3 1 0 o 1 q4, and q4 q3 q2 q, will in like manner be represented by the determinant q41 0 0 1 q3 1 0 O 1 q2 1 o o 1 q1, which is equal to the former. Art. (j.)

C.will become zero); but I do not propose to enter for the present into the theory of these failing, or as they may more properly be termed, Singular cases in the theory of elimination. Art. (in.) The series last obtained for J (f, g) leads to a result of much interest in the theory, and of which great use is made in the concluding section of this memoir, viz. the identification of the Jacobian (abstraction made of the numerical factor n) with what the Bezoutiant becomes when in place of the n variables in it, u, ...n, we write x'-', x-2, .+ X. xI Thus suppose f and g to be each of the third degree, and let AX2+Hx+G I-H2+ Bx+F GX2+ F.X+C be the three primary Bezoutics; if we make x2=u x=V 1=w these may be written under the form Au+Hv+Gw=L Hu+ Bv+ Fw=M Gu+ Fv+Cw=N; and if the Bezoutiant be called g, we have da[ A df[ L=~ M=dT N=d.

And the formula (A.) may be verified in precisely the same manner.

The general expressions above given for the simplified quantities are of course integral functions of h and k, although given under the form of the sums of fractions, by virtue of the well-known theorem that I M(19), where a is an integral function of h, and the summation comprises all the roots (h) offh=O is always integral.

The urgency of the press precludes my investigating for the present the more general theorem which must be presumed to exist, whereby qips can be connected with [q1q2 q?.q or [q2q3. ..qJ, and with [q1 q2q3 qi+e] and [q2 q3-q te+j, when each (q) represents a function of an arbitrary degree in x.

The exact form, however, of such functions, and even the possibility of such form being found capable of making the determinants vanish, remains open for further inquiry. SECTION IV. On somefurther Formula? connected with M. STURM'S theorem, and on the Theory of Intercalations whereof that theorem may be treated as a corollary. As preparatory to some remarks about to be made on the formule connected with M. STURM'S theorem, it is necessary to premise two theorems concerning quadratic functions of great importance, one which, notwithstanding its extreme simplicity, is as far as I know very little (if at all) known, and the other was givten in part mnany years ago bay M. CAucHn, but is also not generally known. The former of Fthese MR. SYLVESTER ON FORMULAX CONNECTED WITH STURMN'S THEOREM. 481 two theorems is as follows. If a quadratic homogeneous function of any number of variables he (as it may be in an infinite variety of ways) transformed into a function of a new set of variables, linearly connected by real coefficients with the original set, in such a way that only positive and negative squares of the new variables appear in the transformed expression, the number of such positive and negative squares respectively will be constant for a given function whatever be the linear transformations employed. This evidently amounts to the proposition, that if we have 2n positive and negative squares of homogeneous real linear functions of n variables identically equal to zero, the number of positive squares and of negative squares must be equal to one another, so that ex. gr. we cannot have ?{U + u1 + &c. ... + UG +U+ 12-z43&c. -u2,,} identically zero when n of the variables are linear functions of the remaining n; and this is obviouslythe case, for if the equation could be identically satisfied we might make Un+2=ul Un+3=U2 .I", Un -1l1 and we should then be able to find u+, as a real numerical multiple of u,, and consequently should have the equation u2. {1+k } =0, which is obviously impossible; atfortiori we may prove that in the identical equation existing between the sum of an even number of positive and of negative squares of real linear functions of half the number of independent variables, there cannot be more than a difference of two (as we have proved that there cannot be that difference) between the number of positive and negative squares. Hence there must be as many of one as of the other; and as a consequence, the number of positive squares or of negative squares in the transform of a given quadratic function of any number of variables effected by any set of real linear substitutions is constant, being in fact some unknown transcendental function of the coefficients of the given function. I quote this law (which I have enunciated before, but of which I for the first time publish the proof) under the name of the law of inertia for quadratic forms. Art. (45.). The other theorem is the following. If any quadratic function be represented in the umbral notation* under the form of (a, xl+a2X2+ ... +an Xn)2, where al, ae... a are the umbrae of the coefficients, and x1, x,...x. the variables, then by writing a, a, al al a, |lXI+>(1 X2+| '! 3+] X4 4+ + Ma| Xn=Yi a, a2 a3 a4 a. a|a, a2 X , & a, 1a a, a a |a ~a, a aa,a a a, a4 a, a. aaa, aaa a, &c.a+ a a.a a, a~ 3a, a~aa4 a, a2 a.a &C. &C. &c.

Reverting now to the simplified Sturmian residues, since by the theory set out in the first Section these differ from the unsimplified complete residues required by the Sturmian method only in the circumstance of their being divested of factors, which are necessarily perfect squares and therefore essentially positive, these simplified Sturmians may of course be substituted for the complete Sturmians for the purposes of M.

SYLVESTER ON FORMUL]E CONNECTED WITH STURM'S THEOREM. 485 with my formule for the Sturmian functions, and prove ab initio in the most simple manner, that the successive ascending coaxal determinants (always of course supposed to be taken about the axis of symmetry) of the matrix to the form above written, or to the more general form (which I shall quote as G, viz.) (g-hj) { pj*(hJ)+ P2(h ) 2 + ** + pm. (hrn) Im }2 .(G.) (where Pl P2.. m are absolutely arbitrary integral forms of function with real coefficients), will form a rhizoristic series in regard to fx (i. e. a series, the difference between the number of the continuations of sign between the successive terms of which corresponding to two different values of e will determine the number of real roots of e lying between such two assumed values), provided only that q be an odd positive or negative integer. Nothing can be easier than the demonstration, for whenever g is greater than any one of the real roots as (hl) 1st. Any pair of imaginary roots will give rise to two terms of the form (1+mV-WA9.(v+w /V 1)2 and (l-mV/ 1)2.(v-ws/Z 1)2; or more simply, (L+MVP1). (v2+w2+2vwVZT) and (LMVZT1) . (v2 2vwV _I), where v and w are real linear functions of ul, u2, ...u.. The sum of which couple will be 2{L. (u2.-V2)-2Mwv} = { (Lu -Mv)2(L2+M2)v2} =p2q2; so that each such couple combined will for every value of x give rise to one positive and one negative square. 2ndly. Any real root of the series t,, h2 ...,h when ? is taken greater than such root, will give rise to a positive square of a real linear function of ul, U2, ...un. 3rdly. Any real root of the same series, when g is beneath it in value (q being odd), will give rise to the negative of the square of a real linear function of the same. Hence the number of real roots between g taken equal to one value (a), and g taken equal to any other value (b), will be denoted by the loss of an equal number of positive squares in the reduced form of the expression (G.) when g is taken (a) and when g is taken (b); i. e. by virtue of art. (45.) will be denoted by the difference of the number of permanencies of sign in the successive minor determinants of the matrix corresponding to the quadratic form (G.)* (which we have taken as outr generating function) resulting * The inertia of the quadratic form G is the measure of the number of real roots of f comprised between mc and p, and may be estimated in any manner that may be found most convenient. If p be made infinity, and Ah be taken equal to hi-', and the inertia of the corresponding value of G be estimated by means of the formulae in ordinary use by geometers for determining the nature of a surface of the second degree, the criteria of the number of real roots infx will be, or may be made to be, symmetrical in respect to the two ends of the expressionft. This system of criteria, however, is not so good as that given by the Bezoutiant to the two differential coefficients of f(x, 1) taken with regard to x and 1 respectively, which will also possess the like character of symmetrical indifference, and be one less in number than the former. 486 MR. SYLVESTER ON THE THEORY OF T'HE INTERCALATIONS from the substitution respectively of a and b in place of a, which gives a theorem equivalent to that of M. STURM, transformed by my formulae, when we choose to adopt the particular suppositions q=a 1Ah= I A2h=h P3.hh h...9Mhhmi This method of constructing a rhizoristic series tofx by a direct process is deserving of particular attention, because it does not involve the use of the notion of continuous variation, upon which all preceding proofs of STURM'S theorem proceed. It completes the cycle of the Sturmian ideas. Happily this cycle was commenced from the other end, for it would have been difficult to have suspected that the root-expressions for the terms in the rhizoristic series could be identified with the residues, had the former been the first to be discovered, and much of the theory of algebraical common measure laid open by means of this identification would probably have remained unknown. Art. (48.). I proceed now to consider a theorem concerning the relative positions of the real roots of two independent algebraical functions as indicated by the succession of signs presented by their Bezoutian secondaries; this more general theory of intercalations or relative interpositions will be seen to include within it as a corollary the justly celebrated theorem of M. STURM. Let the real roots offx taken in descending order of magnitudes be hl h2...h,, and the real roots of px taken in the like order 14 2-...,q so that fAx= (x l) (x h2) . . (xhp)H PX= (X1) (X2) . .. (x n,) K, H and K being functions of x incapable of changing their signs. Now, as in M. STURM'S method, let us inquire what takes place in respect to the sign of f(X) which I shall call the Indicatrix, as x descends the scale of real magnitude from 00 to -0 . If between +co and h,, i real roots of Ax are contained, it is obvious that as x travels fromn +oo to the superior brink of k,, the Indicatrix xvill change its sign from + to and from to + altogether i times, so that at the morment when x is about to pass through h,, it will be positive if i is zero or even, and negative if i is odd; but the moment after x has passed through the value hl, the indicatrix will be negative on the first supposition, and positive on the other supposition. Hence immediately after the passage of x through Il the indicatrix will h1ave been once oftener negative than positive on the one supposition, and as often negative as positive on the other. Again, in like manner as x traverses the interval between h, and the inferior brink of h,, if no 7 or an even number of it's occupy this interval, the sign which the Indicatrix had at the beginning of this interval will have been reversed once oftener than restored; but if there be an odd number of k's so interposed, the number of reversals and restorations will have been identical; and so for each successive interval, reckoned from. a value for x i'mmediatelv subsequent to one real root off*, down to a value immediately subsequent to the next less real root of the OF THE REAL ROOTS OF TWO ALGEBRAICAL EQUATIONS. 487 same; and it is evident that the effect upon the sign of the Indicatrix at the end of every such interval depends, not upon the number of t's grouped together in such interval, but upon the form of the group as regards its being made up of an odd or even number of terms [the first interval will of course be understood to extend from +oo to a value immediately inferior to h,, and the last from a value immediately inferior to hp to o]. Hence as regards the relation of the signs of the Indicatrix at the beginning to the sign at the end of every such interval, nothing will be altered by taking away any even number of n's that may be found therein. If we suppose this to be done, we shall then have in some of the intervals one n occurring and in the other intervals no on; that is to say, some of the h's will be separated by single n's, but other h's will come together. Again, by removing any even number of h's not separated by o's (and thus removing an even number of intervals), it-is clear that as many changes of sign of the Indicatrix will have been done away with from + to as from to +, and no effect upon the excess of the one kind of changes of sign over the other kind of changes of sign will have been produced. By removing pairs of h's in this manner, it may happen that n's will again be brought together, any even number of which, not separated by h's, may again be removed and then pairs of h's not separated by n's in their turn, and so continually toties quoties until at length we In ust arrive at a reduced system of h's and nt's, where no two h's and no two n's comle together, or else all the h's and all the n's will have disappeared. Let the scale of h's and n's thus simplified and reduced be called the effective scale of intercalations. The number of h's and the number of n's in any such scale will be equal, or will at most differ from one another by a unit, since at each part of the scale, except at the end, every h is followed by an n7 and everv n by an h. If the scale begins and ends with an h., there will of course be one more h than n; if it begin and end with an n, there will be one more n than h; if it begin with an h or an n and end with an n or h, there will be as many of the one as of the other. 1st. Suppose the effective intercalation scale to commence with an h; then in passing from + co to just beyond the first h the sign of the indicatrix f changes from + to it changes again from to + as it passes the first n, then again from + to as it passes the second h, and so on; that is to say, there will be a change always in the same direction from + to as x passes, from being just greater than to being just less than any h appearing in the effective scale. 2nd. If the effective scale begin with a, the indicatrix will conversely be negative after passing the first and every subsequent n, and change from to + in the act of passing through the first and every subsequent h. So that on either supposition the changes of sign for the effective scale always take place in the same direction, and the number of h's in the effective scale will be measured by the number of such changes, and consequently will be measured by the difference between the number of times that the indicatrix fi changes its sign from + toas x passes through each in turn of the real roots offx, and the number of times that in passing through any such root it changes its sign from -to +; if the former number be MDCsCLIII. 3 s 488 MR. SYLVESTER ON THE THEORY OF THE INTERCALATIONS greater than the latter, the effective scale of interpositions will begin with a root offx* if it be less, the scale will begin with a root of px. If instead of beginning with +oo and ending with -o we begin and end with any two limits, a and b respectively (making abstraction of all roots offx or of Ox lying outside these limits, and forming the effective intercalation scalewith the roots cornprisedwithin these limits exclusively), we shall obviously obtain a similar result, but with the condition that the changes from + to will be in excess if an even number of h's and it's combined be cut off by the superior limit, and the effective scale begin with an h, or if an odd number of h's and 7's combined be so cut off and the scale begin with an a; and in defect if an odd number of h's and i's combined be so cut off and the scale begin with an I, or an even number be so cut off and the scale begin with an 7. If, now, supposingfx to be of n, and Ox of not more than n, say (m) dimensions, we form the signaletic series fx, Px B,, B, ..B.m (where the B1, B,2 ...B,. are the Bezoutian secondaries or simplified successive residues corresponding to TX expanded under the form of an improper continued fraction), it may be shown, in the same way as for STURM'S theorem, that whenever ;X changes from ito a change of sign will be gained in the series, and fx when from to + a change will be lost; and that no change can be gained or lost except as x passes through the successive real roots of fx. Hence the difference between the number of changes of sign in the above signaletic series when x is taken (a), and the number of the same when x is taken (b), will indicate the number of roots of fx remaining in the effective scale of interpositions formed between such of the roots offx and of px as lie between (a) and (b); calling the one number I(a) and the other I(b), the sign of I(b) 1(a) depends not on the relative magnitudes of (a) and (b), but upon the manner in which the effective scale commences; if I(a)-I(b) is positive, the effective scale formed between the (a) and (b) will commence with a root offx; if negative, it will commence with a root of p(x). Art. (49.). In forming the scale of effective interpositions, it is evidently not necessary to go on reducing the (h) series and the ; series separately and alternately; the same result will be effected more expeditiously by eliding simultaneously any even number of h's that come together without being separated by an a, and any even number of 4's that come together without being separated by an (h), and, repeating this process of simultaneous elision, as often as may be required, until no two h's or A's come together. Thus, for instance, denoting the magnitudes of the series of real roots off and of p by the distances of h and n points taken along a right line from a fixed point therein, and supposing such series of roots between the limits a and b to be hh hI Ii hn n h nn " h i h 4 It Ih h h h " h, our first reduction brings this scale to the form hnihhnnthn~h, the next reduction brings it to the form ho r hfi; OF THE REAL ROOTS OF TWO ALGEBRAICAL EQUATIONS. 489 and a third and final reduction brings it to the form and accordingly we shall find for such an arrangement of the h and ti system I(b)-I(a)=+2. Art. (50.). If we suppose ax= -, by a well-known theorem of algebra, any two consecutive roots of fx will contain between them an odd number of roots of px, and the number of real roots of fx greater than the greatest root of fj, and the number of real roots of fx less than the least root of fx will each be even. Hence the effective intercalation scale between any two limits (a) and (b) will be formed by merely reducing the tz groups to single units, and the number of h's in the scale so formed will be the total number of h's between the limits (a) and (b). Moreover, since such scale commences always with a root offx, or with an even number of roots offx followed by a root offx, if the number of h's and he's cut off be even, and with a root off'x or an even number of roots offx followed by a root offx, if the number so cut off be odd, it follows that for this case I(a)-I(b), (a) being the superior limit, will be always positive, and will measure the total number of real roots off(x) lying between (a) and (b); this, then, is STURM's theorem, treated as a corollary to the Theory of Intercalations. Art. (51.). If we write down the last syzygetic equation between fx of m and p(x) of n dimensions, viz. Tni (x)f(X)-tm-I (X) pX + S it has been shown that the succession of signs in the series formed with fx, Px and their successive Bezoutian secondaries will contain the same number of continuations and variations as the series formed with f(x), tm-i(x), and their successive Bezoutian secondaries. This indicates that the effective scale of interpositions for x an d ox will contain an equal number of roots offx with the effective scale forfx and tml(x); the two scales however will not necessarily be identical, because the roots of vx will not necessarily be in the same order relative to the h's in the one scale as those of t_1 .x relative to the AI's in the other scale. This equality is perfectly well explained a posteriori by the form of tm.,x, which by the formula in Section It. will be represented by -)( *(me hqj -hq,) (hq,7Mhq,) . ,-m Now, whenever x is indefinitely near to any one of the roots of fx, as hq., this suM reduces to the simple expression p0hql hq2..p. * @gl{ph1 *ph2** ph~n}h ~~P~tq1_1 Ou and consequently in the immediate neighbourhood of every real root of fx, p(x) and tm1_ .x will have always the same or always a contrary sign, according as ph ph .ph is positive or negative, which will depend upon the relative disposition of the real roots inf and @; in either case the effiective scale of interpositions forfix with Ox and 490 MR. SYLVESTER ON A NEW METHOD OF FINDING forfx with tm.l.x must contain the same number of h's; but the difference will be, that if 'phl.pk2.h..phr is positive an h will occupy the first place in each scale, or the second place in each scale; but if negative, then in one scale an (h) will occupy the first place, and in the other scale the second place. Art. (52.). The same process of common measure or residues which serves to furnish a rhizoristic series for f(x) or a synrhizoristic series for fx and px, will serve also to furnish superior and inferior limits to the real roots of any proposed equation. Thus suppose fx to be any rational integral function of (x) of the degree (rt) and p(x) any other function of x, which I shall begin with supposing to be of the degree (n"1), and let the successive quotients resulting from the process of finding the greatest common measure offx px continued until the last remainder is not a constant but zero,c be supposed to be (as they may generally be taken, but subject to cases of exception, which will hereafter be alluded to) n linear functions q1 q2... q., then we shall have fx 1 1 1 1 fc ql1+ qs+ qn-I+ qn' and therefore pxK.N fx=K.D, where N is the numerator and D the denominator of the fraction 1 1 1 q, + q2 + ?q and K is a constant (the value of which is immaterial to be considered, but in fact equals + LoL *v2&c., LI 3 L5 LO, LI, L2, L,, &c. being the leading coefficients of the last, the last but one, the last but two, &c. of the Bezoutian secondaries tofx and px).

Then pi is positively or negatively greater than 1, therefore I is a positive or negative fraction, but q, is positively or negatively greater than 2; therefore P2 will be of the same sign in q2, and also b2 will be positively or negatively greater than 1; therefore ? will be a positive or negative fraction, but q3 is positively or negatively greater than 2; therefore 3 will be of the same sign as q3, and also P, will be positively or negatively greater than 1; and proceeding in this way, we find that all values of pi, from i= 1 to i=n1, will be of the same sign as qi,. and positively or negatively greater than 1. Finally, Iwill be a fraction, and therefore, since q,, is positively or negatively greater than 1, p.=qn+ will have the same sign as (qAn) (but of course is not necessarily greater than 1, nor would that condition serve any purpose were it satisfied). We infer consequently, that when the conditions (0) are satisfied, Po, (42, (3... pn will respectively have the same signs as q, q2...q,; and therefore D==pl Pq2.-PJ.3.p,, has the same sign as q,.q2.q3. .qn.

Whenever in any one of the n pairs of equations above written the coefficient of x is positive, the upper equation of the pair will bring out the greater value of x; but when the coefficient is negative the lower equation will give the greater value. Take the pair ai.x + bi= ci l~ b=-c. aix+ bi= ; a. If ai is positive aix+bi will always be positive, and greater than ci between x=x and x= the greater of the two values of x; if ai is negative aix+b iwill always be negative, and less (i. e. nearer to ) than -ci for all values of x between the same limits as before. So again it will be seen in like manner, that whether ai be positive or negative between x= -o and x_ the lesser of the two values of x corresponding to the above pair of equations, aix+bi will always retain the same sign, and will be greater than +ci, or less than ci, according as ai is negative or positive. If, then, we take the greatest of the greaters of the n pairs of values of x, i. e. the absolute greatest of the 2n values, and the least of the lessers, i. e. the absolute least of the same, say L and A between L and A, qa, q2, q. will each always retain an invariable sign, and will then fall without the limits ?c1 ?c, . ?... cn_?cn, so that between +so and L and between A and -c X i tl.. . e. a constant multiple of fx), wrill retain the 492 MR.

It will of course be observed that it is indifferent for the purposes of the foregoing theorem, whether bl be expanded under the form of a proper or an improper fraction, i. e. whether we employ the ordinary or the Sturmian process of successive division, for changing the signs of the residues will only have the effect of changing qj into (4)qi, and the pair of equations (?)q=+c. remains the same whether the + or the sign be prefixed to qj.

SUPERIOR AND INFERIOR LIMITS TO THE REAL ROOTS OF AN EQUATION. 493 LI A2; L2 A2; ... Ln A. will be respectively superior and inferior limits tofx, px and their successive residues. As a corollary, we see, of course, that L and A, the superior and inferior limit to the roots of the given functionfx, must always lie between + X and the greatest root, and between -co and the least root, of the alrbitrarily assumed function Ax. Art. (53.). Let us now assume somewhat more generally that Ax is any number of degrees 01 in x lower than fx, which will cause the first quotient ql to be of the degree 01 in x; and let us further suppose that px stands in such a relation tofx that the following quotients, q02, q3, ... qp, are of the degrees 0, 0.. .0, in x (02, 0,. ..0 being supposed not necessarily units, as they would generally be, but any positive integers whatever, as may happen in consequence of one or more of the leading coefficients in any residue vanishing), then At 1 1 1 1_ fx qel + qo2? + qo, + qop where 01+02+0d3+...0p=n, and consequently fx will be equal to the denominator of the last convergent above written, multiplied by a constant, so that we have now c.fx=m1.M2...rnz, where Ml = qo M2= qo2+ -. *mp~qo,-f Sp 1l 1 1nd as in the case previously considered, so long as >1 >2 >2 >1 q., or q., or q03 or ... q0P or <-1 <-2 <2 <-1 fx will have the same sign as q01.q02... q Let now q0o?+c, qO2 =+C2**.q0 =+c, where cl=1 c2=2...c1_j=2 cp-1. Consider any pair of the above equations as q2 -c = O. 1st. Suppose all the roots of this equation are impossible, q2_c? must be positive for all values of X, and qi can never lie between +ci and cA; moreover, since upon the hypothesis made, q,-F+ci and q,,-c, always retain the same sign, viz. that of the coefficient of the highest power of qui it follows that qir must also always retain the same sign; for if we construct the two curves y=q0+cj and y=q,,-c,, these will both lie on the same side of the axis of x, and never cut the axis, consequently the curve y=qo, which lies between them, must also lie on the same side as either of them, and never cut the axis. Hence, then, if the roots of the equation are all impossible, q% wvill always retain the same sign, and will never fall within the region bounded on its two sides by +ci and -ci. 2nd. Suppose the equation to have one or more possible roots, and s to the greatest, and Xi the least (which of course, if there is b~ut one possible root, will be identical). If 494 MR. SYLVESTER ON A NEW METHOD OF FINDING the leading coefficient of qj is positive, the greatest root (1) of the equation qj-c=0 will exceed the greatest root of (1') of the equation qo,+cj=0; for between x=0x and x=1', q,, must go through all values intermediate between so and -ci; hence there must be a qualitylintermediate between 1' and +oo, which will make q,-ci. In likemanner,ifthe leading coefficient of qo0 is negative, it will be seen that the greatest root of qo0+ci=o will exceed that of q,,-cj=0. Moreover, in the one case q, will be always positive and greater than ci, and in the other always negative, and less than ct. In every case, therefore, between +oo and lj, q0, retains the same sign, and does not fall within the region bounded by +ci and -ci; the same thing may be shown to be true for all values of x between -0o and Xi. Hence, then, by the same reasoning as that employed in the preceding article, we are enabled to affirm, that if we form the equation (qo. I ) (q(24-)4) (q03 4) * (qop_ -4) (q0P its greatest root will be a superior limit, and its least root an inferior limit to the roots of the equationjfx=0, whatever be the value of the assumed function Px; and if the above equation (..) has no real root, all the roots offx will be imaginary. Art. (54.). In the preceding two articles it has been supposed that all the quotients are taken integral functions of x; but the process of successive division may be so conducted as to give rise to quotients of the form i+ ~~d I ax bibt-l+ ...+c+-+ .*. +w Suppose then that we have in general fa; 1 1 1 fxq ? + q2+ +q,05 where qj, q2, ... q. are each of the general form above written (but of course i and i' being not necessarily the same for any two of the quotients), and suppose that the sum of the degrees in x of q,, q2, ... q, is n+t, where t is essentially (as it must be) positive. Then we shall find, as in the last article, that L and A being called the greatest and least roots of (q21)(q2-4) ... (qn_ I-4) (q_ 1i), D the denominator of the last convergent to the continued fraction above written, will never change its sign between + o0 and L, nor between A and -x ; but here we shall have fx Kxtx D. Hence xt.D will be invariable in sign within each of these two intervals. 1st. Let t be even; then f(x) will be invariable in sign, whatever L -and A may be for each such interval. 2nd. Let t be odd; then if L is >0 and A<Of(x) cannot change its sign in either interval ; but if L is <0 or A> 0, fx will change its sign as x passes through zero, but will be invariable for each of the three regions contained between +0o and L, L and 0, or 0 and A (as the case may be), and A and 00; so that universally L and A will be a superior and inferior limit to the roots of fx, making abstraction of the r'oots (if any such there be in fit) whose value is zer~o. Art. (55.). I shall close this section with offering (for what it is worth) a bare SUPERIOR AND INFERIOR LIMITS TO THE ROOTS OF AN EQUATION. 495 suggestion as to the mode in which the theory of Intercalations may hereafter be found to admit of being extended from a system of two general functions of .v, to a system of three general functions of x, y, four general functions of x, y, z, and in general to a system of s general functions of sI variables, or which is the same thing, of s homogeneous functions of s variables. In the case of two functions of v, f(X) and Px, fvO and _v=O may be considered to represent two systems of points in a right line; and the theory relates in this case to the relative positions of these two " Kenothernes " or point systems; and of course using x and y to denote the distances of any point in a line from two fixed points therein respectively, instead of fv and px, we may employ two homogeneous functions of x and y, as f(x, y) and p (x, y), to denote these two systems of points. So, sirnilarlv, if we have three functions of two variables,f(x, y), g(x, y), h(x, y), which I shall suppose to be of the same degree, we mnay consider the mutual relations of the Monothemes, that is to say, the three plane curves, denoted by the equations f(x, y)=O, g(x, y)=O, h(x, y)=O. Now every two of these will intersect one another in a system of points, which we may call (f, g) for the intersections off and g, (g, h) for those of (g and h), and (h,f) for those of h and f. If we take any two of these systems of intersections, as (/; g) and (g, I), they will both lie upon one of the given curves (g). And by reading off the two systems of points (f, g) and (g, h), arranged according to the order upon which they are disposed upon the curve g, we may, by following the course of such curve, form a scale of effective intercalations for these two systems, and in like manner for the two systems (g, h) and (hf); (h,f) and (f, g). Now I believe that it will be found that when r g, h represent any algebraical curves consisting of a single continuous line, either extending to infinity in both directions, or returning to itself (and I have fully satisfied myself of the truth of this for the case of ellipses), each effective scale of intercalation will contain the same number of pairs of points; if, however, the curves consist of more than one branch, as if hyperbole be considered, such is no longer necessarily the case; from these facts, conjoined with the light thrown upon the subject by its relation to the theory of combinants explained in the succeeding section, I am induced to infer the probability of the truth of the following law (which for avoidance of further uncertainty, I confine to the case of functions of the same degree), viz. that if f, g, h be three homogeneous functions of x, y, and z of the same degree, and if 19, V, W be any three linear functions off,g, h, and if U =O, V= O, W=O be treated as the equations to three cones, and if we form an effective scale of the intercalations of the lines of intersection of U and W, and V and W, according to the order in which they are disposed upon W (which seems to require that the lines shall be continuous, in order to admit of a fixed order of reading off the intersections of any two of them upon the third) ; then whatever value may have been given to the coefficients in the linear functions the number of elements remaining in any such; scale will (as I conjecture) be constant, and some theory (to be discovered) for three functions analogous to that of Bezoutian residues for two functions will serve to determine the MDCCCLTII. 3T 496 MR. SYLVESTER ON A DEVELOPMENT OF THE METHOD OF ASSIGNING number of the elements so remaining. And so, in like manner, but with a difficulty increasing at each step (as at the next step we should have to pass into quasi-space of four dimensions), a theory of intercalations may be conjectured to exist for any (n) general functions of any (n1) variables. Development of the method of assigning a superior and inferior limit to the roots of any algebraical equation. Art. (ac.). Since the articles in the preceding part of this section on the method of discovering limits to the roots of an algebraical equation were written, the method of which the germ is therein contained has presented itself in a much more fully developed form, which I proceed to exhibit: for greater simplicity I shall suppose Ox to be of n1, and fx to be of n dimensions in x, and that by means of the ordinary process for common measure (except that as in STURM'S theorem the sign of all the remainders are changed) A has been thrown under the form of the improper continued fraction 1 1 1 1 where q, q2...q, are all restricted to signify simple linear functions of x. Suppose the series q1, q2, q3, .. .q, to be resolved into the distinct sequences ql q2 ... q; q?il qi+2..qei; vqitl.q *I..q()+l **. in such a manner that in each sequence as qi+l qi+2-..qil qthe coefficients of x have all the same sign, but that in any two adjoining sequences the coefficients of x have opposite signs, so that for instance in q, and qi~l the coefficients of x are unlike, as also in qi, and qt?1; there will of course be nothing to preclude any of these sequences becoming reduced to a single term. The first theorem is, that the greatest and least roots of the product of the cumulants [ql q2*qt1 x [qill qi+2--.qi,]...*x [q(i),+ q(,)+2*-qn] are superior and inferior limits to the 'roots of fx. To prove this theorem I begin with premising the two following lerammas, one virtually and the other expressly contained in the Philosophical Magazine for the months of September and October of the present year*. * Each of these two lemmata flows readily from the faculty previously adverted to engaged by every cumulanit of being representable under the form of a determinant. As to the second lemma, it becomes apparent immediately when the cumulant is so represented, by separating the matrix into two rectangles and expressing the entire determinant according to a well-known rule for the decomposition of determinants as a function of the -determinants belonging to these two rectangles taken separately. As to the first lemma, by reason of the cumulant [X1 w2.. -1 Wi Wil+] being so representable, we know that when [w1 w. .. . wJl Wi] -0, [WX I Wi-l. and [w1 W2..-. wi+] must have opposite signs. Suppose, now, that the theorem is true when the number of elements in the type does not exceed i; then the roots of [w . I w w]..], say of 4iri, being called k1 h,. ... and of [wl w?.. . w1 wi, say of 4, being called k1 kg, . ki, these may-be arranged in the following order of SUPERIOR AND INFERIOR LIMITS TO THE ROOTS OF AN EQUATION. 497 Lemma A. The roots of the cumulant [q1, q2... qj], in which each element is a linear function of x, and wherein the coefficient of x for each element has the like sign, are all real, and between every two of such roots is contained a root of the cumulant [q, q2. ..qij], and ex converse a root of the cumulant [q2 q.. .q], and (as an evident corollary) for all values of g and a' intermediate between 1 and i the greatest root of [q1 q,...qilyqi] will be greater, and the least root of the same will be less than the greatest and least roots respectively of [qp qp1 . ... qp,qU.]. Lemma B. For all values of the elements q, q2. . .qn, the cumulant [qlq2-* *qXo-l q. q, q,+2 .. *q n =[ql q2 ... qfD-1 q.O] x [q,+, q(.+2 * *q. [ql q2' .. gq.-I] X [q,+, .. -q.fi] Thus ex.gr. the cumulant [abed], i.e. abcd-ab-cd-ad+l, [ab] X [cd] -[a] X [d] (ab -1) (cd-, I ad, and [abcde], i. e. abcde-abc-abe-ade-cde+a+c+e=[abc] [ae] [ab][-], i. e.=(abc-a-c)(de-1)-(ab-l)e. Art. (P.). Now suppose that q1 q2. . q+l ... qX are all linear functions of x, and that the coefficients of x have all one (say the positive) sign in qq2.. . q., and all the contrary signs in qa, ...qn, andletLbe notlessthan the greatest root of [q q2 ...qO] orof [q,+1...qn], and also let A be not greater than the least root of each of these same two cumulants; then by lemma A, L and A will also be respectively greater than the greatest, and less than the least roots of [q1 q2 ..q,1] and of [q<,?2. . .qn]. Now the coefficient of the highest power of sin both [q1 q.. .qj] and in [q1 q2..qo)D1] is positive, but as to [qw?il..qn] and [q?2t.. qn] is of contrary signs in the two, viz. negative in that one of those cumulants which contains an odd, and positive in that one of the two which contains an even number of elements. Hence by virtue of Lemma B. L and any quantity greater than L substituted for x will make [q1 q2 qn] to have always the same sign, and in like manner it may be shown that A and any quantity less than A substituted for x will also cause [q, q2...qn] to retain always the same sign. Hlence L and A are superior and inferior limits to [q, q2.. qn]; and the same reasoning would magnitude k1h k21q k3 ... . kiI 1 ki; and if the roots of [X1 w .. . Wj--1 wi Wi+ I], say of s+e 1, be called 12 . . . + 1, from the fact of the leading coefficients in ev'l and 4fil? expanded according to the powers of x having the sa me sign, it follows that when x= o, 4i-i and 41j?1 have the same sign, but they have contrary signs when x-k; but pi-I does not change its sign between x=so and x=k, hence 4pi+i does change its sign between x=03 and xekt, and therefore a root of 1Pi+j lies between co and k,; in like manner precisely it may be shown that a root of gPi+ lies between -o and ki; and since Awil changes its sign between Ick and kg, between kg and k *k, and between hi and ki, A1ki? I must likewise change its sign between one and the other extremity of each of these intervals, and hence the roots 11 1 .... 4?,i are intercalated between oo , kIc, ki, -G O, or which is the same thing, kI, k,....ki are respectivelyintercalated between 11, l,...4+1; consequently if the theorem is true up to i, it is true for i + 1, and therefore true universally; but is manifestly true when i=2, for then x= + cc makes [w,, wVj, iR. e. WI we-1 positive; but w1=0 makes it negative, which proves the theorem contained in Lemma A. 3 T2 498 MR. SYLVESTER ON A DEVELOPMENT OF THE METHOD OF ASSIGNING evidently apply if we had supposed the signs of the coefficients of x in the first partial series of elements to have been negative, and in the other series of elements to have been positive. The greatest and least roots of [q1 q2. ..q,] x [q,+1 .qn] evidently satisfy the condition to which L and A are subject, and may be taken in place of L and A respectively. They will accordingly be superior and inferior limits to the cumulant [ql q2 q, ~qw+1.*.q] Again, by virtue of theorem (B.) it may readily be shown that [ql q2 * *qwl qel~l q',2+2 * *qto2qw2+j1 ** *qn] -[q1 q2..*q] x [q.1+1 qw1+2 .. .q2] X [qt2?1* *.q.] -E q1 q2... .q1] x [Eq,+2... .q2] x [Eq 2+1..qn] [q1 q2... q*o] x xqa+,.. .q>21] X [q,2+2* q*j] +[qi q2-q. q1_l] X [qwl+2..q .q2-1] x [q 2J+2. .qn] and hence if q1 q2... q, are all linear functions of x in which the coefficients of x have all the same algebraical sign in any one (taken per se) of the three series ql q 2 2 *qAl; qW,+J*i q W2; q,,,+,... @qn:7; but so that this sign changes in passing from one series to another, it is easily seen, by the same reasoning as in the preceding case, that the two positive and two negative products on the right-hand side of the equation all give the same sign to the coefficient of the highest power of x, and consequently that if L and A be superior and inferior limits to [q, * *qtwj] [qw~1 * * *q.,2]3 [q@2 qn *A], and consequently by Lemma A, to Efq1 f~ [ql+2.. .f2], [qw+j ... q2-1], [q(,+2.1.q12-, and to [q,2+2. ..qtj L or A substituted for x will cause [q1 q2.. . q] to retain always the same sign, and will consequently be superior and inferior limits thereto; and so in general; whence it follows, returning to the theorem to be demonstrated, that the greatest and least roots of [ql q2 }qj] X [boi+ qj+2 ...qj] X *Zx [q + l...q], will be superior and inferior limits to the cumulant [q1 q2...qn], i. e. to C.fx*, and therefore tofx, as was to be proved. * If fX expanded as a continued fraction by means of the common measure process gives rise to the quotients q', q2,...q,, and if L1, L2... Ln1, L. be the leading coefficients of the successive simplified residues, (L. being, in fact, the final simplified residue, i. e. the resultant to px, fx), we must have x_= C [q,, q:, ...qn fx=C[q , q2.. .q,], where (supposing qx to be of n-i, andfx of n dimensions in x), SUPERIOR AND INFERIOR LIMITS TO THE ROOTS OF AN EQUATION. 49 Art. (y.). The second theorem is the followingg: if q1 q2, ...qn, be linear functions of x say alx+b1, ax+b2.. .aax+bn, in which the coefficients of b have all the same sign, and if we take the quantities p i, . , all having the same sign as al a...a, but otherwise arbitrary, and make k,=M4 k2=p22+j k3=p.+kn..fk2+ ,kn= P I Pe~~'~ f?n-2 1 then the greatest of the quantities kl-bl ke + b2 kn bi a, 1 a, 2 an say L, is a superior limit, and the least of the quantities -k1-bl -k2-b2 -kn-bn al a2 ' an say A, is an inferior limit to the roots offx. L and any value greater than L substituted for x will evidently make q1-k,; q2 k2...; qn-k., all of them positive. Hence when x= or >L q, is positive and > p and 1 1 1 1. q2> 2 2> p2i. e. is positive, and > 2, 11 11 1 1-.. ->k3 3->>P3+--.>-, i e. is positive, and >fk,, Mq P2 fk2 th2 and q.q... i. e. is positive, qn-1qn-2 q, l n-X I/n-, and consequently the cumulant [qlq2q3 q.j which =q1 x ( q2'-) X (q3 _ ) x &C.) remains of a constant sign when L and any quantity greater than L is substituted for x.

It may be remarked that the quantities PI' P2+;g1 {PJ3 Jr,;**tin-2+U nl p, A may be derived successively from one another, according to the same law, from whichever end of the series we begin. If we take any two consecutive terms as 1 1 the effect of diminishing Pfo is to decrease the first of these two terms, and pro tanto, to tend to deduce the limit, but on the other hand, , being increased, there is brought into play an opposite tendency, which operates pro tanto to increase the value of the limit. Art. (a.). It is of importance to remark, that by a right selection of the system of quantities ~k1 f~i2.. .d, which enter into the composition of k1 k2. .k, L may be made to coincide with the greatest root of [91 q2...q] and so in like manner by a right selection of another system of these quantities, whereby to form ki k2... k, A may be made to coincide with the least root of the same. Thus let , f..p2, be so chosen, that 91-keyO q2-k20... qn-kn-0 are all satisfied by the same value of x.

Art. (4.). The general method of enclosing the roots offx within limits is founded upon the combination of the two theorems above demonstrated. An arbitrary function px one degree in x below, fx being assumed, and by aid of the auxiliary function pxfx being thrown under the form C[q,) q2* qi q, 2 * q5 * . ' * (q)1, (q)2. ..

(q)(i,]. Art. (n.). When all the roots offx are real, if ox be so assumed that all its roots are intercalated between those of fx, the partial quotients to Lx will form but one single series. In order that Ax may fulfill this condition, it is necessary that the coefficients of Ax shall be subject to certain conditions of inequality, not necessary here to be investigated; but no conditions of equality, i. e. no equations between the coefficients of )x, are introduced by this condition; or in other words the coefficients* of As, the auxiliary function, are independent and arbitrary within limits; and we have shown that in this case the auxiliary constants pq 6k9.. 2 may be so determined that the limits may be made to come separately and respectively into contact with the two extreme roots. When all the roots of fx are not real, the quotients (however ox' is chosen) can no longer be inade to form a single series.

SYLVESTER ON A D VELOPMENT OF THE METHOD OF ASSIGNING auxiliary constants, this coincidence may be brought about, so long as there is a single real root infx. It is rather important to demonstrate this universal possibility of effecting a coincidence of the limits to the roots with the extreme roots themselves, because it is the most striking feature which distinguishes the method of limitation here developed from all others previously brought to light. Art. (O.). Before entering upon this demonstration I may make the passing remarke, th,(At every method of root-limitation is implicitly a method of root-approximation. For instance, let e be any given quantity between which and +oo it is known that ats root of fr lies. Then if we write x=e+I, and form the equation y (e+I =0., and find L a superior limit to y, it is clear that e+E will lie between e and the root offx say E, next superior to e. Again, making x=e+L+p, and finding a superior limit L' to y', we shall have e+L+L, still nearer to E than e+L was; and so we may proceed advancing nearer and nearer, and always from the same side towards E at each step, and finally obtain E under the form e+!+L/+L,,+ &c. And in like manner calling En the root next below e, we may find E,=en it-a, &c. Art. (i.). In establishing the theorem of coincidence above adverted to, the following notation will be found very advantageous. Let Q denote a Type of any number of Elements, as q1 q2... qiqj, and let ?' denote this same type when the last element, and 'O the same type whene the first element is cut off, and 'O' the same type when both extremes are cult off, so that the apocopated type Q' will mea n [q1 q2. ..qi,] ; the apocopated type 'Q will mean [q2 q3... qJ, and the doubly apocopated type 'Q' will mnean [q2 qs ... q-1] If now a type Q be made up of the types Q, Q2...Qi put in apposition, and if we use in general [Q] to denote the cumulant corresponding to the type Q, there will be a very simple law* connecting [Q] with [Q.1] [Q2] [Q3] * [Qi-2] [Qi-1] [Qia] [RI [Q2] ['31 ...

[Q] may be expanded under the form of the sum of 2S-l products separable into i alternately positive and negative groups containing respectively 1, (ii), (i-i) 2 ...(i1), 1 products. Art. (z.). In every one of the above groups forming a product the accents enter in pairs and between contiguous factors, it being a condition that if any Q have an accent on the right the next Q must have one on the left, and if it have one on the left the preceding Q must have an accent on the right, and the number of pairs of accents goes on increasing in each group from 0 to iI. Trhis rule serves completely to define the development in question+. * The sign of equality is employed here to denote the relation between a concrete whole and the aggregate of its parts. t The number of distinct factors entering into these products, taken collectively, is evidently i+ 2(i1) + (i-2), i. e. 4(i-1) . + When each partial type El consists of a single element, every doubly accented &2 will vanish, and every singly accented El will become unity; hence we may derive the rule for the expansion of the cumulant [a, a 2a.... a in terms of al a,... aj, which will accordingly consist of a,-a.a3--a ! ~ (ja . j (a, . a2,.

Qel it may easily be made out that each term in the development of w in terms of WI, wl 1w, 'WI ; w2W Q4, W2, {i ; &c. will have the same sign when we give to x a value which is a superior limit, or an inferior limit to the roots of each of the cumulants I, 02, ...

'; the products affected with positive -signs being all positive or negative in themselves, and those affected with negative signs being reversely all negative, or all positive. Thus, ex. gr. if Q=Q0Q2 and the sign of the leading coefficient in '02 will be the contrary of that in 02, but w, and w,, have both the same positive sign; so again if Q=Q1Q2Q3, =h2 " '1 *W2 *3 01 *02 .W3 + 1*02 *03, where the leading coefficients in 0J2 and 'w2 have contrary signs, as have also those in 02 and xX between 02 and 1w2 have the same sign ; and of course the leading coefficients in x1> 03, , I03 have all the same sign, they being all positive, and so in general. But the superior limit to the roots of any integral algebraical function of x substituted in place of x causes the signs of the resulting values of the functions to coincide with the signs of the leading coefficients, so that in the example last above given, L a superior limit to all the factors in the several products in the equation substituted for x will make 01.w2.03, 1 .'02.035, -WI.02.02J3 WI 'r.'w3 to have all the same sign. The like will be true of A the inferior limit; for if Q0, Q21 Q3 contain respectively no, n2, n3 elements, the values of the four products last above written, when x= oo, will be to the values of the same when x= + co in the respective ratios of _m1m,+m,. 1M ()i1+m2+m32: I ()ml+m2+%-2 11; (m+flm+m3-4. 1 and so in general. Hence we deduce the theorem, that if the total type 0 represent the aggregate in apposition of the partial orders Q1Q2*. (the elements being understood to be linear functions of x, which are subject to the law of alternation in the signs of the coefficients of x in passing fromn one partial type to another), no superior SUPERIOR AND INFERIOR LIMITS TO THE ROOTS OF AN EQUATION. 505 limit to WI, a'2, ...wa,, can make a vanish unless each separate product in the expansion of a in terms of W1I WI, .wre and the appurtenant apocopated cumulants vanish separately. Art. (x.). From the above theorem we may deduce the following law, viz. that if the roots of W1, ?2, . . a', be supposed to be arranged in order of magnitude, and X to be that one of them which is nearest to + so or to xo, then if e is even it is impossible for x to be a root of a. Thus suppose e=2, and consequently W=WI-1.a'2-a *'"WI2; if X be a root of W1 and one of the two extremes of the roots of a1, a' put in order of magnitude, X cannot be a root of 'a2, for the roots of 'a2 are confined between the roots of '2,; but if X make a and a' each vanish, we must have wl~t.a2=0, hence w' =0 as well as w1=0, which is impossible. In like manner if a root of a'2 were the extreme root, the same impossibility could be in like manner established. Again, suppose e=4, so that r CU'.C1 U2 U2 3_ C3 4 C CU1 U2 C3U C *.23' 4U+1 2 3' U4 CIr C2C 3U4 = a'Ia'J2 tl 4 32 3 oJ3 *4 1 2 3 ' ' l I.

As regards the doubly accented quantities a, the same thing cannot be affirmed, because if any Q contains only one element the corresponding value of a with a double accent vanishes spontaneously. Again, any of the unaccented quantities a may vanish, because we may suppose any of these to have an extreme root A. Consequently the first, second and fourth of the equations remaining to be satisfied, might be satisfied on making the necessary suppositions as to the form of the quantities a and the values of the extreme roots; but the third remaining equation 4;.''2 '!3 .'aP4=0, in which only singly accented quantities a occur, remains incapable of being satisfied on any supposition whatever. And the same thing would be true if we suppose X to be a root of any other a instead of a1. Hence X cannot make x=0 when e=4. In like manner, if e be any even number 2s, there will be an equation W'1 * 2 * A)3 * W4 * W'5 * d6 .. *2 * }-1 * 2? = ? to be satisfied by that value (if it exist) of x which, besides being an extreme (on either side) of the roots of 1, a', -.. a2e arranged in order of magnitude, also makes a'0.

SYLVESTER ON A DEVELOPMENT OF THE METHOD OF ASSIGNING C1*).02.025 can be a root of w, as was to be proved. Consequently, unless Px is so assumed that the number of changes of sign in the coefficients of x in the quotients resulting from L expanded as an improper continued fraction is even (for if the fx changes from sequence to sequence are odd the number of sequences themselves is even), the method of limitation in the text cannot give the means of drawing either limit indefinitely near to one or the other extreme roots offx. Art. (p.). It now remains to prove the converse, and to show, 1st, that when the number of changes is even, i. e. the number of sequences odd, this coincidence can always be effected; and 2ndly, that it is always possible when fx has one or more real roots, so to assume px that the number of sequences shall be odd. The first part of the proposition is easily proved. Thus suppose e=3, so that W IW1*2 3 41. W2 W3 WI 2^ W3 + 01" 2' "W3" If we suppose X either extreme of the scale formed by writing in order of magnitude, the roots of w, C4 w3 to be a root common to w, and to 03 and if lo2=0, which last equation may be satisfied by supposing the type .2 to consist of a single element, the separate equations WI.0230 *= 1.?a2* 3=0 S-O '?1.*4r* 3=0 ? 012*0*3=? will all be satisfied; and so in general it may be shown without difficulty that if e=2s+1, and if X be a root common to wlo,=O w,=6V5 .w,,,+=? and if o, w,, -2; be all simple linearjunctions of x, so that consequently o2=o0 '4=O. ..G26=O each separate term in the development of w will vanish singly and separately, and consequently X will be a root of o: for since X makesWo=O o,=. ... .028+1=0, every product in the developed form W, in which x,, .. *.-w2,+1 do not each bear at least one accent, will vanish; and if we consider any product in which W1, W3 ... wV2+l are all accented, if in any two of these immediately following one after the other as w22-1, k+1, an accent falls to the right of the first, and to the left of the second, the intervening term 02k will bear a double accent, and will therefore vanish, since f2k is supposed to be a linear function of x; but it is impossible when every X is accented to prevent two accents of contiguous odd terms in any such product, from falling to the right of the left, and to the left of the right, term of the two, since the contrary would imply that all the accents would fall to the right, or all to the left, which, as above remarked, is impossible, on accoun of the two extreme terms being only simply accentable, i. e. 01 only to the right, and w2,+1 only to the left. Hence, when x substituted for X makes W, 02.-* ?2,+1 all vanish, and when 2, 04, ... w2k are all linear functions of x, x=X will be a root of a. Art. (P.). I believe that the remaining part of the proposition may be rigorously demonstrated, viz. that when any of the roots offx are real, and the number of odd integers not exceeding the index of the degree offx is m, and the number of i'maginary pairs of roots infx is -, -may be so assum-ed that the quotients to E_ expanded SUPERIOR AND INFERIOR LIMITS TO THE ROOTS OF AN EQUATION. 507 under the form of an improper continued fraction, may be made to take the form Q1; Q2; Q,; 0 4; ...; Q2i1, where Q2; 04; ... Q2i are linear functions of x, and i is any number assumed at will, not less than A, and of course not greater than m; and where x1; W3 rW2i+l will have in common a root ?,, which may be made at will the greatest or the least root of WI *W2*W3*W2i+1; the investigation, however, according to the present light which I possess on the subject, appears complicated and tedious, and therefore, in order that the press, which is waiting for the completion of these supplemental articles, may not be kept standing, must be adjourned to some future occasion. For the present I content myself with showing the truth of the law for the simple case wherefx is a cubic function of x. Ist. If 1, gives rise to a single sequence of quotients Q, we know, from the theorv of intercalations, that it is necessary that all the roots of fx shall be real, and in order that when this is the case the quotients may form a single sequence Q, it is only necessary so to assume Ax, that its roots may be intermediate between those offr. 2nd. If the roots off'r are not all real, or if they are all real, but do not compose the roots offx intercalated between them, and if for greater brevity of ratiocination we. stipulate that px shall have its leading coefficients of the same sign as that of the leading coefficient offI, the leading coefficients of the three quotients will either bear the respective signs + + -,or the respective signs + +, or the respective signs + --; in the first and last of these cases there would be two sequences, and therefore, by what has been shown above, the method of limitation of the text could not give a limit coincident with a root. Let us then look to the remaining case, and inquire whether, and how, Ax may be assumed so thatf/ shall become representable to a constant factor pros by the cumulanit [p(x-a), -q( -a), r(x-a)], where p, q, r are all positive, and a is a root offx. Let this culmulant be called hlf. Nothing in point of generality will be lost if we suppose the leading coefficient of hfx to be -1. We then have hfx=[p(x-a), -q(x-P);,r(x-a)] -pqr(x-a)2(X b)(p+r)(x-a) and writing xa=x2+Bx+C and making x=a, we find from the above identity that p+r=a2+Ba+C, i. e. p=a2+Ba+C-r, and pqr(x-3)=x+a+B, hence 3+a+B=O, i.e. -B-a, '1 1 and pqr= , and .-. qr= '2+B,+C-, Hence if Ax bie so assumed that the quotients to f are p(x-a);,-q(ac-I); r(xc-a), 508 MR. SYLVESTER ON A DEVELOPMENT OF THE METHOD OF ASSIGNING we have hpx= [-q(x-P3), r(xa)]=-qr(x+B+a)(x-a)-I --qr(x2+Bx-a2-aB)-I = -{X2+Bx-a2'-aB+p}. Hence p(x) is of the form m(x2+Bx-a2-aB+(a2+aB+C-r))=-M(x2+Bx+C-r). If we call the three roots offx, a, b, c respectively, we have 1 1 qr(a2+ Ba+C-r) r((a_b)(a-c) Tr) and since q and r are both to be positive, we see that (a) must be taken the greatest or least of the three roots if they are all real, so that a2+Ba+C may be positive, which it will of course necessarily be if b and c are imaginary; we must also have a2+Ba+C-r positive, so that the form of px is rn((x2-a2)+B(x-a)-t), t being necessarily positive, but otherwise arbitrary, a form containing two arbitrary constants, one of which is subject to satisfy a certain condition of inequality; whereas when fx is of such a form as to admit, and ;(x) is supposed to be so assumed as to cause it to come to pass that the quotients to " form a single sequence, then the three coefficients in px ft remain exempt from all conditions of equality but are subject to two conditions of inequality. And so in general when the degree offx is x and the number of sequences 2i+ 1, it is to be inferred that the n coefficients of Ox will be subject to satisfy n-i--I conditions of inequality and i conditions of equality. Art. (e.). The theory of the determination of the minimum interval between either limit determinable by this method and the nearest root, or between the two limits so determinable when Ax is so assumed that fx gives rise to a defined even number of sequences (which will include the theory of the case where all the roots of fx are imaginary), must be deferred to an opportunity more favourable for leisurely contemplation. As regards the application of the theory to the very interesting case of all the roots being imaginary, the principal point remaining to be cleared up is the determination of the least value that can be assigned to the greatest, and the greatest value that can be assigned to the least root of the algebraical product X,.X2.X,...X, where X,, X2, ...X2,. are all of them real linear functions of x, subject to the condition that the cumulant [X1, X2, X3.. .X2j] shall (to a numerical factor pr~s) be equal to a given function of the degree 2n in x incapable of changing its sign, which condition implies, as a necessary consequence, that the coefficients of x in each of the terms X1, X2,...X2, must be affected with the same algebraical sign. Art. (o.). It should be observed that in the application of the above method, the division of the series of quotients into distinct sequences governed by the signs of the coefficients of x is introduced for the purpose of drawing the limits closer to the roots, 'but is not necessary for the mere object of assigning limits.

Hence we have the following valuable practical rule for finding a superior and inferior limit to the cumulant [al(X-Cl)., a2(X-C2),,,. an(x-c,)], where a1, a2, ...an have the same sign, viz. if C be the greatest, and K be the least of the quantities cl, c2,... c1, C+A will be a superior, and K-A an inferior limit, A being taken equal to the positive value of aloa2 a2.a3 a3 a4 Ia .an and it may be noticed that C and K are the quantities which wvould themselves be the superior and inferior limits to the given cumiulant if the series of terms a,, a2,.a", instead of presenting only a sequence of continuations or permanencies, presented only a sequence of changes or variations of sign. SECTION V. On the Theory of Intercalations as applicable to two functions of the same degree, and on the formal properties of the Bezoutiant with reference to the method of Invariants. Art. (56.). Iffx and px be any two given functions of x of the same degree m, we may form a system of m Bezoutics to f and p (as shown in the first section), the coefficients of the powers of x -1, , .. so in which will compose a square matrix of m lines of m terms each, which will be symmetrical in respect to the diagonal AS APPLICABLE TO TWO FUNCTIONS OF THE SAME DEGREE. 511 which passes through the first coefficient of the first Bezoutic and the last coefficient of the last Bezoutic; and we may construct a quadratic homogeneous function of m new variables, such that its determinantive matrix shall coincide with the Bezoutic square so formed. This quadratic form may be considered in the light of a generating function. All its coefficients will be formed of quantities obtained by taking any two coefficients in one of the given functions, and two corresponding coefficients in the other given function, multiplying them in cross order, and taking the difference: each coefficient of the generating function in question will consist of one or more such differences, and will thus be of two dimensions altogether, being linear in respect to the coefficients off, and also linear in respect to the coefficients of p. This generating function I term the Bezoutiant, and it may be denoted by the symbol B(f, p): the determinant of B is of course the resultant to f, Ah and the matrix to B is the Bezoutic square to f, p. Now we have seen that the decrease in the number of continuations of sign in the series 1, B,(x), B2(x)...Bm(x) (where B,(x), B2(x)...Bm(x) are the (n) Bezoutics to f, p), as x changes from a to b, measures the number of roots of fx retained in the effective scale of intercalations taken between the limits (a) and (b). If we take the entire scale between +o and -x the total number of effective intercalations will be the same, whether reckoned by the number of roots of f or of p remaining; for these two numbers can never differ except by a unit, since no two of either can ever come together; but the number of each remaining in the effective scale will be m-2iand m-2i' respectively, i being the number of pairs of imaginary roots and pairs of unseparated real roots of f and i' being the similar number for P; so that we must have i=i'. Now obviously this number becomes measured by the number of continuations of sign in the signaletic series 1, (B,), (B2), ... (Bi), where in general (Be) denotes the principal coefficient in Bi(x). But (B,), (B2), ... (B.) are the successive ascending coaxal minor determinants about the axis of symmetry to the Bezoutic square; and accordingly the number of continuations just spoken of, measures the number of positive terms in the Bezoutiant when linearly transformed, so as to contain only positive and negative squares, or in other words, measures the inertia of the Bezoutiant,Athe constant integer which adheres to it under all its real linear transformations. Art. (57.). This inertia is the samne number as in the case of a homogeneous quadratic function of three variables, used to express a curve referred to trilinear coordinates, serves to determine whether such conic belongs to the impossible class or to the possible class of conics, being 3 or 0 in the former case, and 1 or 2 in tile latter; or as in the case of a homogeneous quadratic function of four variables used to denote a surface referred to quadriplanar or tetrahedral coordinates, serves to determine whether such surface belongs to the impossible class or to the class consisting of the ellipsoid and the hyperboloid of two sheets (which are descriptively indistinguishable), or to the hyperboloid of, one sheet, being 0 or 4 in the first case, MDCCCLIII. 3 X 512 MR. SYLVESTER ON THE THEORY OF INTERCALATIONS I or 3 in the second, and 2 in the third. The most symmetrical (but least expeditious) method of finding the inertia of any quadratic form is that which corresponds to the method of orthogonal transformations, and is, in fact, the usual method employed in geometrical treatises on lines and surfaces of the second degree. If we apply this method to the Bezoutiant B considered as a homogeneous quadratic function of the (m) arbitrarily named variables u1, u2, u3 *..Uz in order to measure its inertia, that is to say, the number of effective interpositions between the two systems of roots, we must construct the determinant d2.B d2B d2B d2B du2 du,.du, du,.du3du,.du, , d2B d2B d2B d2B du,.du1 duS du,.du3 d du.

If in fx and Ox we reverse the order of the coefficients, and fx and px so transformed become f1 (x) and (p (x), it is obvious that the roots off1 and P, being the reciprocals of the roots off and p respectively, the number of effective intercalations to/f and p, must be the same as forf and p. Accordingly we find that the form of the Bezoutiant tof and p is the same as that of the Bezoutiant to fi and pl, the sole difference (one only of names) being that B(ul, u2, ... um-li Urn) for the one becomes B(Um, Urnl, ... au, u1) for the other. The equation D(X), which determines the inertia of B, remains precisely the same as it ought to do for either of the two systemsf and f orf and A Art. (58.). The theory in the preceding articles of this section may be made to embrace the case involved in STURM'S theorem ; for if fx=ao.x"+al .Xn'+ ...+am-j.x1m1+am.xm f x=mao.xl+(n.l)aj Xn-2+ ...+a.-, and fix=mx-f 'x =al.xn-1+2a,.

Hence then the form of the Bezoutiant tof'x and]i> will serve to determine the number of pairs of imaginary, and consequently also the number of real roots to Axi It should be remarked that the form of the Bezoutiant tof'x andfx,, considered as a quadratic function of u,, u2...2umj and of the coefficients inf(x), will remain unaltered when forfx we write fix, for this will change the signs throughout of fx and fx, and consequently the coefficients in the Bezoutiant, which contain in every term one coefficient fromf'x, and one fromfix, will remain unaltered in sign. Art. (59.). It appears then from the preceding article, that for every function of x of the degree m, there exists a homogeneous quadratic function of (n1) variables, the inertia of which augmented by unity will represent the number of recal roots in the given function. Now this inertia itself may be measured My the number of positive roots of a certain equation in x formed from the quadratic function (in fact the well-known equation for the secular inequalities of the planets), all whose roots will be real. Hence then we are led to the following remarkable statement. " An algebraical equation of any degree being given, an equation whose degree is one unit lower may be formed, all the roots of which shall be real, and of which the number of positive roots shall be one less than the total number of real roots of the given equation." Let us supposefx written in its most general form, the first andl last as well as all the intermediate coefficients being anything whatever: by reversing the order of the coefficientsf'x will becomefix andfix will becomef'x; the Bezoutiant tofix andf'x (which we may term the Bezoutoid to fr) will remain unaltered except in sign, and the equation of the (ml)th degree in A formed from the Bezoutoid remain unchanged, consequently the equation in X enables us to substitute, for the purpose of calculating the total number of real roots in f(x) in lieu of STURM's auxiliary functions tof(x), another set of functions which remain unaltered when the order of the coefficients is completely reversed, i. e. in effect, when we consider the number of real roots off(-) in lieu of those off(x). And of course more generally the equation of the mth degree in k formed from the Bezoutiant to any two functions fx and Ox of the mth degree each in x, supplies a set of functions for determining the total number of effective intercalations between the roots off(x) and p(x), which do not alter when we consider in lieu of these, the roots off($) and p(h) This substitution of functions symmetrically formed in respect to the twvo ends of an equation for the purpose of assigning the total number of real roots in lieu of the unsymmetrical ones furnished 3x2 514 MR.

STURM, had been long felt by me to be a desideratum, and as an object the accomplishment of which was indispensable to the ulterior development of the theory, and it is certain that I did not in anticipation exaggerate the importance of the result to be attained. Art. (60.). It may happen that the Bezoutiant tof and p (each of the mth degree) may become a quadratic function of less than m independent variables, or the Bezoutoid tof (a function in x of the mth degree) of less than (m1) independent variables. Trhis will take place whenever f and p have roots in common, or whenever F has equal roots. The number of independent relations of equality between the roots of f and A, and the amount of multiplicity, however distributed, among the roots of F, xvill be indicated by the number of orders thus disappearing out of the general form of the Bezoutiant and Bezoutoid in the respective cases*. In what particular mode the form of each would be affected according to the manner of the distribution of the equalities and the multiplicity requires a specific discussion, which I must reserve for some future occasion. Art. (61.). I shall devote the remainder of this memoir to a consideration of the properties and affinities of Bezoutiants or Bezoutoids, regarded from the point of view of the Calculus of Invariants. For this purpose it will be more convenient hereafter to convert all the functions which we are concerned with into homogeneous forms, and I shall accordingly for the future usef and p to denote functions each of x and y, which I shall write under the form f=ao..zrn+mai.x ..y+m. +-+am Xm rn-i p=b0.xm+b1 omwl. m 2-b2. Xrn2 .f+ +bn Xm In what follows a knowledge of the general principles of the Method of Invariants is presupposed, but a perusal of my two papers on the Calculus of Forms in the Cambridge and Dublin Mathematical Journal, February and May 1852, will furnish nearly all the information that is strictly necessary for the present purpose. The first point to be established is, that B, the Bezoutian of fx and Ax, is a Covariant to the systemf, p; the variables in B being in compound relation of cogredience with the combinations of powers of x and y, m-1. m-2 -3 m-1 f y I * I *y e That is to say, I propose to show that if f g, h,n k be any four quantities, taken for greater simplicity subject to the relation fk-gh 1, and if on substitutingfx+gy for x and hx+ky for yJf(x, y) becomes A0.xm+mA,.xm-'.y+m. m 2 As.xr2 3+A. .ym, say G(x, y), * I have elsewhere defined how this word order, as here employed, is to be understood.

(fx+gy)(hx+ky)n-1; (hx+ky)nml are respectively of X, yn-i . x m-1. ,m B will become identical with B'. I was led to suspect the high probability of the truth of this proposition concerning the invariance of the Bezoutiant from the following considerations: 1st. That for the particular case wheref and p are the differential derivatives in respect to x and y respectively of the same function F(x, y), the Bezoutiant of f and p, which then becomes the Bezoutoid of F, determines the number of real factors in F, which obviously remains the same for all linear transformations of F. 2ndly. That takingf and pin their most general form,; the invariant to their Bezoutiant, i. e. the determinant of their Bezoutiant is an invariant off and 5, being. in fact the resultant of these two functions; now as every concomitant (an invariantive form of the most general kind) to a concomitant is itself a concomitant to the primitive, so it appeared to me, and is I believe true (although awaiting strict proof), that any form satisfying certain necessary and tolerably obvious conditions of homogeneity and isobarism, a concomitant to which is also a concomitant to a given form, will be itself a concomitant to such form; this principle, if admitted, would be of course at once conclusive as to the Bezoutiant being an invariantive concomlitant to the functions from which it is derived. Art. (61*.). Since the publication of the two papers above referred to on the Calculus of Forms, I have made the important observation that every species of concomitant, however complex, to a given system of functions, may be treated as a simple invariant of a system including the given system together with an appropriate superadded system of absolute functions; thus an ordinary covariant involving only one system of variables, as u, v. w ... cogredient with x, y, z ... the variables of a system S, is in fact an invariant of the system S combined with the system uxvy, vz -wy wx-uz, &c., U, v, w ... being treated as constants; so again a simple contravariant of S is an invariant of S combined with the equation ux+vy+wz+&c.; so again, to meet the case before us, a covariant to the binary system f and p expressed as a function of Ua, U2..-.u, where U1, U2...

That the Bezoutiant possesses this property is evident; for if instead off and p we write kf+ip and kf+i'p, any such quantity as ar, b. a..b, (a, br being coefficients in f, and a8, b8 the corresponding ones in p) becomes (ka,.+ib.) (kla.,+i'b,)-(ka,+ib,) (k'a,+i'bq.), . e. (ki'-k'i)(a,.bs,-as. br)) so that B, the Bezoutiant, becomes increased in the ratio of (kiI kti)m, i. e. remains always unaltered in point of form and absolutely immutable, provided that ki'-k'i be taken, as we may always suppose to be the case, equal to 1. We derive immediately from this observation, the somewhat remarkable geometrical proposition, that the intersections with the axis of x made by any two curves of the family of curves u=?kf(x)+PP(x), ( and p being functions of x of the same degree) give rise to a constant number of effective intercalations, whatever values be given to A or p for the two curves so selected. Art. (65.). B(u, u2, ... Ur) being a covariant of the systemf and p, and ul, ,2, ... Umr cogredient with xm'l X,-2.YO .ym1, it follows from a general principle in the theory of invariants, that on making ul, u2, ... ua, respectively equal to the quantities with which they are cogredient, B will become an ordinary covariant tof and p. By this transformation B becomes a function of x and y of the degree 2(m1) in x and y conjointly, and linear in respect to the coefficients of f and also in respect to those of p. The only covariant capable of answering this description is what I am in the habit of calling the Jacobian (after the name of the late but ever-illustrious JACOBI), a term capable of application to any number of homogeneous functions of as many variables. In the case before us, where we have two functions of two variables, the Jacobian df dp dx' dx df d; df dp dy' dyf We have then the interesting proposition*, that the Bezoutiant to two functions, when the variables in the former are replaced by the combinations of the variables in the latter, with which they are cogredient, becomes the Jacobiant. So in the case of a single function F of the degree m, the Bezoutiant, i. e. the Bezoutoid to dF dF , on making the (m-I ) variables which it contains identical with m-2; m-3."y; respectively, becomes identical with the Jacobian to dF dF i.e. the Hessian of F, viz. I d2F d2F daM dxdy d2F d2FJ dxdy'; TY* I have subsequently found that this proposition is contained under another mode of statement, at the end of Section 2 of the Memoir of JACOBI, De Eliminatione," above referred to. t For a strict proof of this proposition see Supplement to Third Section of this memoir.MDCCCLIII. 3 y 520 MR.

Thus if f= ax5+ bxoy+ CX3y2 + dxy'+ exy4+ y5 p= MX5+PX4y + yX3y2+ X2y9 + SXy4+?,y5, using (r, s) in the ordinary sense that has been considered throughout we obtain by VIEWED WITH RELATION TO THE METHOD OF INVARIANTS. 521 taking the sum of the sinister bands in (a.)* for the value of B when we write, xx4) ,xy%.xyl, yl in placeof U1, u2,u 3,u4U, 5 (0 1 )X8+ 2(0. 2)x7y + (3(0, 3) + (1, 2))Zy + (4(0, 4) +2 (1, 3))ty +((0,2 5) +3 (1,2 4) +(2,2 3) X4y4 + 4(1, 5)+2(2~, 4) x3 15+(2,5+ , 4) xsy( +2(3, 5)Xy7+ (4, 5)y8 The direct process requires the calculation of (5ax4+4bx'y+3cx2y2+2dxy0+ e14) (fx4+2rx3y +34x~y2+ 4sexy3+ 54) -(5 4+4px'y+3rx~y+ 2wXy3 +y4) ( bx4+2cx3y + 3dx2y2+4eXy3 + 5lyl), each coefficient of which will contain the numerical factor 5; so that to reduce the Jacobian to its simplest form each coefficient will necessitate the employment of additions, subtractions, and a division, instead of additions merely, as when the Bezoutic square is employed. For instance, to find the coefficient of x4.y from the above expression (ar.), we have to calculate (25(05 5)+16(1, 4)+9(25 3)+4(35 2)+(4, 1)), is en 25 (05 5) + (16 1 )(1, 4) + (9 -4) (25 3) 5 which is 5(0, 5)+3(1, 4)+(2, 3), agreeing with what has been found above for the value of such coefficient, by a simple process of counting. The same remark will, of course, also apply to the computation of the Hessian of F by means of its Bezoutoid, (Art. 66.). This relation between the Bezontiant and the Jacobian led me to inquire whether, as would at first sight appear probable, the Bezoutiant were the only lineo-linear quadratic function of (m) variables covariantive tof and p (the word lineo-linear being used to denote the form of coefficients, such as those in the Bezoutiant, linear in respect of the coefficients in f and the coefficients of p). If so, then there would have existed a method of performing the inverse process of recovering the Bezoutiant from the Jacobian, almost as simple as that of deriving the Jacobian from the Bezoutiant. On investigating the matter, however, I found that such is by no means the caset, but that there exists a whole family of independent lineo* Vide art. 62. t This might have been concluded immediately from the following observation.

SYLVESTER ON THE FORMAL JROPERTIES OF THE BEZOUTTANT linear quadratic covariants of m variables to every two homogeneous functions of x and y of the mth degree. I have, moreover, I believe, succeeded in determining the number of such lineo-linear quadratic forms for any value of (m), of which all the rest, in whatever manner obtained, may be expressed as linear functions, the coefficients of the linear relations moreover being abstract numbers; in other words, I have succeeded in forming the fundamental or constituent scale of lineo-linear quadratic forms of 7n variables covariantive tof and p; a result of too great interest, as exhibiting the affinities of the Bezoutiant to its cognate forms, to be altogether passed over in silence. Supposing the number of linearly independent forms of the kind to be v, then speaking a priori any of the forms taken at random might seem to be equally eligible to form one of the v included in the fundamental scale, combined with any (v1) others independent inter se, and of which the selected one is also independent. In fact, however, this is not so; for it will always be more satisfactory to contemplate the fundamental scale of forms as generated successively or simultaneously by a uniform process; and in the case before us, the process which I have hit upon, and which I believe is the simplest that can be employed for generating the fundamental scale, will be found not to include directly the Bezoutiant among the number. There will thus arise two subjects of inquiry,; st, the mode of forming the fundamental scale, and proving its fundamental D=O is the condition to be satisfied in order that J may be representable under the form of the sum of the squares of (m -1) linear functions of x and y, and D itself is an invariant to J, and consequently an invariant and (as is obvious from its form) a combinantive invariant to f and p. Moreover, which is more immediately to the point, we know that the quadratic form Q (Aoul+ 2A1(ul. (i-2l)u) +A2{(( n-l)u,)'+ 2u. ( )(m-2)) u} + &c. +A2m2U will be an invariant tof, 9 and &2 (this last quantity & being defined as in p. 5 24), and a combinantive covariant tof and 9 in the same sense precisely as the Bezoutiant is a covariant to the same, and like the Bezoutiant is lineo-linear in respect of the coefficients off and p. If we operate with the symbol E, where E represents d, d d d 2 d us+ 2 d .Ulu, u (v?2v,. u.)+ &c. +dA m-2 dA0 dA-,1 + A 2 dA3M-2'm upon K any invariant of f and 2, we shall obtain E. K, a quadratic function of vUv2.. . Uv, which by the rules of the Calculus of Forms we knowwill be a contravariant tof and 9, and the matrix corresponding to which must evidently be persymmetrical. It is an interesting subject of inquiry, which I reserve for some future occasion, to determine the Co-bezoutiant, the Discriminant of which must be employed for K, so that when this discriminant is operated upon by E, the matrix corresponding to E.K may become identical (term for term) with the matrix which is the inverse to the Bezoutiant matrix, which inverse, as JACOBI has so simply and beautifully demonstrated, possesses this persymmetrical character. Vide the " De Eliminatione," section 5. The investigation of the arithmetical connexion between the Q of this note and the fundamental Co-bezoutiants must be also similarly reserved. I believe it to be generally true, and have verified the fact for the case of two cubic functions, that E . Q gives a quadratic form such that the corresponding matrix is the inverse to the matrix of Q. The calculations necessary for extending the verification of this remarkable proposition for functions of x, y exceeding the third degree (notwithstanding that they are much abbreviated by the application of the rules of the calculus) still remain excessively laborious. The abbreviation alluded to consists in confining the verification in question to the comparison of either one of the two unreiterated terms at opposite corners of the matrix to E. Q with the corresponding term in the inverse matrix of Q;if these coincide, it is easy to prove that every other pair of corresponding terms in the two matrices must also coincide respectively with one another. VIEWED WITH RELATION TO THE METHOD OF INVARIANTS. 523 character; 2ndly, determining the numerical relations which connect that very important form, perhaps of all of its kind, the most important with the forms comprised in the fundamental or constituent scale. These questions I propose to consider more fully at a future period. For the present I shall content myself with giving a method of forming the constituent scale (without however, seeking the proof of all the forms extra to such assumed scale being linear functions of these comprised within it), and with determining the numerical relations between the forms in this scale and the Bezoutiant for a limited number of values of m. All the forms which we are seeking, besides being lineo-linear qucadratics, must also be combinantive invariants to f and p, remaining (as forms) unaltered for any linear substitutions impressed either upon the variables or upon the functions containing the variables. Art.

We have thus two forms, Tj and Qj, each of the same even degree (2m-(2i+1)) in respect of x, y. Forming between these the lineo-linear invariant Gi, GQ will be a function lineo-linear in respect of the coefficients of f and p, and quadratic in respect of the system ul, u2, ... Umr. Moreover, (Q, will (by the general principle of successive concomitance) be an invariant in respect to the system f, p, Q?, and combinantive in respect to f and p. Thus then Gi for all admissible values of i will belong to the family of forms to which the Bezoutiant is to be referred. It requires to be noticed, that when i is taken (0), SO that Tf and GQ are of the degree 2(m1), Ej for this case must be taken equal to &22, which evidently fulfills the required conditions of being of the degree 2(mn.1) in (x, y), and quadratic in respect of the coefficients of Q2. If, now, m be even, we may take for 2i+ 1 successively all the odd numbers from 1 to (m-1) inclusively, and there will be forms Gj; when m is odd we may take for 2i+ 1 successively all the odd numbers 2 from 1 to m, and the number of forms of GQ will be 2+. It should be observed, that when m is odd and 2i+1= m, Tj will become identical with the lineo-linear combinant tof and p and Qz with the quadrinvariant to Q ; and no power of x or y will enter into either, so that Gm will become simply TmX Q.n I am now able to enunciate the proposition, that Go, GI, ...

As regards the present memoir, I shall content myself with exhibiting a partial verification of this law as regards the connection of the Bezoutiant with the G scale of Co-bezoutiants, and a complete determination of the numerical multipliers which express this connection for the cases comprised between m=2 and m=6 taken inclusively. It is impossible to predict for what ulterior purposes in the development of the C'alculus of Invarianlts these numbers may or may not be required, and it seems 5i26 MR.

The remaining pages of this memoir will accordingly be devoted to the aseertainment of them. The theory, of the Bezoutoid being included within that of the Bezoutiant, need not hereafter call for any s'pecial attention; I may merely notice that the Bezoutoid to a function of the degree (m) will be a numerico-linear function of m of the Gs if in be odd, and 2 of the G's if m be even.

U, Ur respectively, all the G's become (to a numerical factor pr&s) identical with one another and with the Jacobian to the system (ft). Art. (72.). The foregoing theory took its origin (as will have been readily imagined) in meditations growing out of the celebrated theorem of M. STURM. There appear to be several directions in which a development or extension of the subject matter of that theorem may be sought for. Thus a theory may be constructed relative to a single function of one or more variables, viewed in all cases as representing a geometrical locus. In the limiting case, when this locus becomes a system of points in a right line, we have the theorem of STURM; generally the theory will be that of contours. Or, again, a theory may be formed in which the number of functions is always kept equal to that of the variables. We have then a theory of discreet points corresponding to roots, the number of real ones of which comprised within given limits it is the object of such theory to determine. M. HERMITE, in a memoir recently presented to the French Institute, appears to have made a valuable addition to the Sturmian theory extended in this direction, to which the beautiful researches of M. CAUCHY and the joint labours Of MM. LIOIvILLE and STURM, with reference to VIEWED WITH RELATION TO THE METHOD OF INVARIANTS. 535 the disposition of the imaginary roots of equations appear to have led the way. Finally, the number of variables may be supposed to be arbitrarily increased, but made always inferior by a unit to the number of the functions in which they are contained, or which comes to the same thing, we may construct the theory of a system of homogeneous functions equal in number to the variables in them, which in its simplest case becomes the theory of Intercalations which has been here partially considered, and which (as has been shown) embraces (not as a particular case, but as an implied consequence and easily extricated result) the theorem of M. STURM. London, June 25, 1853. General and Concluding Supplement. Art. (a.). The expressions given in art. (n.) for the partial quotients of the continued fraction represented byf-a are restricted to the supposition of all these partial quotients (except the first) being linear in x; when the first partial quotient is linear the formula (B.) of that article continues applicable on replacing (Di 1a)by 1. I was forcibly struck by the peculiarity of these formulae not ceasing to be true in consequence of the first partial quotient being supposed non-linear; and reflecting upon this, I was soon led to perceive that all the partial quotients might be supposed to be arbitrary integral functions of x, and the formula would still continue to apply to any such of them as might happen to be linear, although, as it were, inlbedded among a group of other non-linear partial quotients. From this it was but an easy step to perceive that the formulae A and B must admit of extension to the representation of partial quotients of any form, and that the dimorphism of the representation of tile linear partial quotients could only be a consequence of the equation in integers u+v= I having two solutions u=O, v= I and u= 1, v=O. I now proceed to enunciate the very remarkable general theorem (or as it may perhaps not inappropriately be termed Algebraical Porism), by virtue of which any partial quotient of a given degree in x belonging to an infinite continued fraction, all of whose partial quotients are alge, braical functions of x may be expressed to a constant factor pres, by means of tile numerator and denominator (or if we please either one of these) of the convergent immediately antecedent to and of the numerator and denominator of any convergent not antecedent to the partial quotient which is to be determined.

(p.) is discovered, and the way laid open (by an unexpected channel) for a complete discussion of the theory of the singular cases which may occur in the expansion of any rational algebraical fraction under the form of a continued fraction. Art. (A.). In the above expression, if we suppose ci-=1, we have u= I and v=O, or u_=O and v-l, and remembering that LA l=<>h and [h ]=Fh nlt 42-'.na_ _h, h *hm_ jtiP] =F'h, and ] D'h hts ht ... htm 0 38 -t Qi+? becomes by virtue of the general formula representable under either of the equivalent forms A and B. Art. (ni.). It may be worth while to notice, that, although (of course) these formule and the general formulae of (art. :), when supposed converted into functions of x and of the coefficients of F and of 'D by the reduction, integration and summation of the symmetrical functions of the roots which enter into them remain universally valid, and subject to no cases of exception, yet antecedently to these processes being performed the formulae as they stand may become illusory when any relations of equality exist between the roots of d) inter se, or between the roots of F inter se. Thus in the case before us, if cD have equal roots the form ula commencing with K0,, I is illusory, and if F have equal roots the other of the two formulae becomes illusory. Letus take the second of these and suppose that F(x) has k, roots cl, A2 roots c2, .+...kA roots cno RATIONAL INTEGRAL CONTINUED FRACTION. 537 we may pass to the actual case from any case where the roots are infinitesimally near to the actual roots of F(k), and all infinitesimally different from one another.

But I pass on to the representation of what is more material, viz. the form of the complete residue in the case supposed, merely observing (as an obiter dictum) that the existence of each singular partial quotient (meaning thereby a quotient non-linear in x) only affects the form of the single simplified residue in immediate connexion with itself, and not at all the forin of the other residues antecedent or subsequent to that one.

As an inferior limit tofx is identical with a superior limit tof(-x), we may confine our attention to superior limits alone. Suppose then that S 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 where the partial quotients Q are each of any arbitrary degree in x, and have all one algebraical sign in the coefficients of the highest powers of v fromn Q1 to Qi, and all the same sign (contrary to the formern), in the coefficients of the highest powers of x from Qt to Qt, and so on alternately, then 1?, a superior limit to the superior limits of the cumulants [Q1Q2...Qi], [Ql, Q/20.Q ])...

SYLVESTER ON THE CONVERSION OF A SERIES types, the point for each fracture of the total type being marked by a change of sign in the elements of the type for the value x= +x ; it is easily seen therefore from this, that if (DX is the generatrix of the cumulant in question, the number of such fractures (i. e. the number one less than the number of partial cumulants) will be the number of changes of algebraical sign in the signaletic series, consisting of the leading coefficients in Fx and in each of the odd-placed complete residues respectively, together with the number of changes of sign in the signaletic series, consisting of the leading coefficients in 1Px and in each of the evenplaced complete residues respectively. The syzygetic theory of two algebraical functions, and the allied theory of algebraical continued fractions with their principal applications, may, I think, now be said to be completely made out, as well for the singular cases as for the general hypothesis.

The number of effective intercalations between the roots of PDx, Fx is easily seen to be equal to the excess of the number of positive real numerators over the number of negative real numerators in the partial fractions of which is the sum, and hence we see 'a priori, as an obvious consequence of a sirnple extension of the reasoning in art.

SYLVESTER ON A THEORY OF SYZYGETIC RELATIONS. 54 Glossary of nlew or unusual Terms, or of Terms used in a new or unusual sense in the preceding Memoir. Allotrious.-The allotrious factor to a residue or quotient in the process of common measure applied to two algebraical functions is the constant factor of which such residue or quotient must be divested in order to become an integral and irreducible function. Apocopated.-Applied to a type in the Theory of Cumulants, denotes a type the final or initial element of which has been taken away. If both are taken away, the type is said to be doubly apocopated. Bezoutic.-For definition of Primary and Secondary Bezoutics see first Section. Bezoutiant to two functions, each of degree n, is a homogeneous quadratic invariantive function of n variables, the form of which serves to assign the index of the scale of the effective intercalations of the real roots of the two given functions. Bezoutoid.-The Bezoutiant to two homogeneous functions obtained by differentiation from one homogeneous function of two variables. The Bezoutoid to a given function of rn dimensions in the variables is accordingly a quadratic function of (mn-1) variables, the form of which is sufficient for determining the number of real roots in the given function. Characteristic.-The employment of this word has been avoided in the preceding memoir; but as it contains an idea of capital importance in analysis, and especially in all inquiries of the kind here treated of, I subjoin the definition of its meaning. The characteristic of a simple condition of any kind is the rational integral function (in its lowest terms) whose evanescence necessarily and universally implies and is implied by the satisfaction of such condition. A simple condition has always a single characteristic, abstraction being made of the algebraical sign, which remains indeterminate. In like manner, a multiple condition, or a system of conditions, will have for its characteristic a plexus of rational integral functions, whose evanescence necessarily and universally implies and is implied by the satisfaction of such multiple condition or system of conditions. The number of functions in the characteristic plexus will however in general greatly exceed the index of the multiplicity of the conditions, and need not always be a unique system. There are however exceptions to this: thus the duplex condition, that a biquadratic function of x shall contain a cubic factor, or that a curve of the third degree shall have a cusp, will each be definitely characterized by a plexus of two functions, and no more. The spirit of the higher analysis resides, and is to be sought for, in the logic of characteristics. Co-bezoutiant.-Any homogeneous quadratic function similar in form and in its property of invariance to the Bezoutiant. Cogredient and Contragredient.-A system of variables is cogredient to another system when, it is subject to undergo simultaneously therewith linear substitutions of a like kind, and contragredient when it is subject to undergo linear substitutions simultaneously therewith but of a contrary kind. Combinant.-A function of the quantities appearing in a given set of functions which remains unaltered as well for linear substitutions impressed upon the variables as for linear combinations of the functions themselves. Concornitant.-Nomen generalissirnum for a form invariantively connected with a given form or system of forms. Conjunctive.-A syzygetic function of a given set of functions. Any function which i.niversally, MDGCCCLIII. 4 B 544 GLOSSARY OF NEW OR UNUSUAL TERMS, and subject to no cases of exception, vanishes when a certain number of other functions all vanish together must be a conjunctive (i. e. a syzygetic function), or a root of a conjunctive of such functions. But if its vanishing is subject to cases of exception, then all that can be predicated of it is that it is syzygetically related to such functions, but it may, and usually does happen, that it will be syzygetically related to them in more than one way. (Contravariant.-A function which stands in the same relation to the primitive function from which it is derived as any of its linear transforms to an inversely derived transform of its primitive. Covariant.-A function which stands in the same relation to the primitive function from which it is derived as any of its linear transforms to a similarly derived transform of its primitive. Cumulant.-The denominator of the simple algebraical fraction which expresses the value of an improper continued fraction. See Type, infra. Determinant.-T his word is used throughout in the sinole sense, after which it denotes the alternate or hemihedral function the vanishing of which is the condition of the possibility of the coexistence of a system of a certain number of homogeneous linear equations of as many variables. Dialytic.-If there be a system of functions containing in each term different combinations of the powers of the variables in number equal to the number of the functions, a resultant may be formed from these functions by, as it were, dissolving the relations which connect together the different combinations of the powers of the variables, and treating them as simple independent quantities linearly involved in the functions. The resultant so formed is called the Dialytic Resultant of the functions supposed; and any method by which the elimination between two or more equations can be made to depend on the formation of such a resultant is called a dialytic method of elimination. In such method accordingly the process of elimination between equations of a higher degree than the first is always reduced to a question of elimination between equations which are of the first degree only. Discriminant.-The resultant of the n differential coefficients of a homogeneous function of n variables. See Resultant, infra. Disjunctive.-A disjunctive equation is a relation between two sets of quantities such that each one of either set is equal according to some unspecified order of connexion with some one of the other set. Effective scale of intercalations is the series of the real roots of two functions of x written in order of magnitude after repeated processes of removing pairs of roots. belonging to either the same function (when not separated by roots of the other function): the roots of the two functions follow each other alternately. Effluent.-From every homogeneous function of any number of variables i of the degree mm', where mm' are any two integers, may be formed (as shown in the Calculus of Forms, Section I.) a covariantive function of the degree m and of px variables [where p, is the number of permutations that can be obtained by dividing m' into i parts (zeros admissible)], in which all the coefficients are numerical multiples of the given coefficients; covariants so formed may be termed effluents of their primitive. An example of this occurs in the foot note to Section V. p. 522, where the quantity there called tl is a quadratic effluent of the Jacobian. -Elemeuet.-.A simple component of the type to a cumulant, See Cumulant, sura OR OF TERMS USED IN A NEW OR UNUSUAL SENSE. 545 Emanant.-The result of operating any number of times (suppose i times) upon a given homogeneous function of any number of variables x, y, a.. . t with the operative symbol d dd I d Y + zt z+ e+ is called the ith emanant of the function operated upon. Every emanant is a covariant to its primitive, the new variables &!, y zr,... tt being cogradient with the variables x, y, z... t with which they are respectively associated. E2t+if, E2i+i page 522, are emanants off and p. The process of emanation is one of incessant occurrence in the theory of invariants. When the order of the emanation is the same as the degree of the function (supposed to be rational and integral) from which the emanation proceeds, the form of the original function is reproduced in the final emanant, the names only of the variables being changed. Endoscopic, Exoscopic.-When the coefficients of the functions concerned in any investigation are regarded as integral indecomposable monads, the method is called exoscopic, and endoscopic when the coefficients are treated with reference to their internal constitution as composed of roots or other elements. In addition to the examples in the foot note to Section 1, these words have a marked and most important application in the theory of Invariants, especially of two variables. Form.-Any function may be regarded as an opus operatum; the matter operated upon being the variables, and the substance of the operations being the form, which resides in the function as the soul in the body. A form is always common to an infinity of functions, but for greater brevity may be and frequently is called by the name of some specified function in which it is contained. Fundainental.-The fundamental scale of a system of Invariants or Concomitants is a set of the same, whereof every other is a Rational Integral Function. Hessian or Hessean, named after Dr. OTTO HEssE, -of Konigsberg (the worthy pupil of his illustrious master, JACOBI, but who, to the scandal of the mathematical world, remains still without a Chair in the University which he adorns with his presence and his name), is the Jacobian to the differential coefficients of a homogeneous function of any number of variables. It is to a Jacobian what a Bezoutoid is to a Bezoutiant, or a Discriminant to a Resultant. Hyperdeterminants.-See Memoir of Mr. CAYLEY, Cambridge and Dublin Mathematical Journal, May 1845, and CRELLE's Journal of about the same date. Improper, continued fraction is a continued fraction differing only from an ordinary one in the circumstance of negative signs being substituted for positive signs to connect the terms. Inertia.-The unchangeable number of integers in the excess of positive over negative signs which adheres to a quadratic form expressed as the sum of positive and negative squares, notwithstanding any real linear transformations impressed upon such form. Intercalations.-The theory of intercalations is the theory of the relative distribution of the real roots, or point-roots, of two or more equations, but in this theory the number of roots mutually interposed is to be taken only with reference to the number 2 as a modulus. lnvariance.-The property (under prescribed or implied conditions) of remaining invariable. Invariant.-A function of the coefficients of one or more forms which remains unaltered when these undergo suitable linear transformations. 4BX2 546 GLOSSARY OF NEW OR UNUSUAL TERMS, Inverse.-The inverse to a given square matrix is formed by selecting in its turn each component of the given matrix, substituting unity in its place, making all the other components in the same line and column therewith zero, and finally writing the value of the determinant corresponding to the matrix thus modified in lieu of the selected component. If the determinant to the matrix be equal to unity, its second inverse, i. e. the inverse to its inverse, will be identical, term for term, with the original matrix. Jacobian.-The Jacobian to n homogeneous functions of n variables is the determinant represented by the symmetrical collocation in a square of the n differential coefficients of each of the n functions. Kenotheme.-A finite system of discrete points defined by one or more homogeneous equations in number one less than the number of variables contained therein. Limiting Series.-One set of quantities whose extreme values are exterior to the extreme values of a second set is set to limit the latter. Matrix.-A square or rectangular arrangement of terms in lines and columns. Minor Determinant.-Any determinant retained represented by a square group of terms arbitrarily chosen out of a matrix is a minor determinant thereto. The simple terms of the matrix are the last minors, and of course if the matrix is a square, it will itself in its totality represent a single complete determinant. Monotheme.--A line, or finite system of lines, defined by one or more homogeneous equations two less in number than the numbers of the variables contained therein. Order. The orders of a homogeneous function are the linear functions of the variables the least in number by aid of which the function admits of being expressed. Persymmetrical.-A symmetrical matrix, in which all the terms in the diagonal bands transverse to the axis of symmetry are identical, is said to be persymmetrical. Ex. An addition table. Quadrinvariant.-An invariant of which the terms are quadratic functions of the coefficients of the primitive. Relation (simple and compound). Vide Substitution, infra. Resultant.-The resultant of n homogeneous general functions of n variables is that function of their coefficients which, equalled to zero, expresses in the simplest terms the condition of the possibility of their coexistence. Rhizoristic.-A rhizoristic series is a series of disconnected functions which serve to fix the number of real roots of a given function lying between any assigned limits. Signaletic.-A signaletic or Semaplhoretic series is a sequence of disjunctive terms, considered solely with reference -to the algebraical signs of plus and minus which they respectively carry. Singular.-A proper algebraical function of a given degree, n, in one variable in its most general form, will, in respect to that variable, be of the nth degree in the denominator and. the (n-I)th degree in the numerator, and will admit of being represented by a continued algebraical fraction of n terms, all of them linear. But for particular values of, or relations among, the coefficients entering into the given fraction this mode of representation fails, and the continued fraction, instead of consisting of linear terms OR OF TERMS USED IN A NEW OR UNUSUAL SENSE. 547 n in number, will consist of terms, some of them at least, non-linear, and fewer than n in number. These then are the singular cases (or cases of singularity) in the theory of the development of an algelraical fraction under the continued fraction form; and it will be seen that according to this definition the case of the development of any proper algebraical fraction in which the degree of the numerator is more than one unit below that of the denominator, belongs (strictly speaking) to the class of singular cases; and this view of the case supposed is perfectly correct and conformable to the analogies of the subject. Substitution (linear, similar or contrary).-A linear substitution is said to be impressed upon a system of variables when each variable is replaced by a linear conjunctive of all the variables. The matrix formed by the coefficients of substitution arranged in regular order is called the Matrix of Substitution, and is of course a square. When two substitutions (impressed in two systems of variables) have the same matrix, they are said to be similar and contrary when their matrices are contrary, i. e. mutually inverse to each other. When two systems of variables are supposed to be subject to the condition that their substitutions are always similar or always contrary, they are said to be related or in simple relation, the relation being of cogredience in the one case and of contragredience in the other. When a linear substitution is impressed upon a system of independent variables, a corresponding linear substitution is necessarily impressed at the same time upon every complete system of homogeneous combinations (i. e. products and powers and products of powers) of these variables, the matrix to which latter substitution will consist of terms which will be functions (depending upon the degree of the homogeneous combinations) of the terms of the matrix to the primitive substitution. This matrix may be termed a compound matrix, having the primitive matrix for its base. If, now, two systems of independent variables are subject to be synchronously impressed with substitutions, the matrices to which (not being both of them simple matrices) have for their bases matrices which are either similar or contrary, these two systems will be said to be in compound relation of cogredience in the one case, and of contragredience in the other. Syrrhizoristic.-A syrrbizoristic series is a series of disconnected functions which serve to determine the effective intercalations of the real roots of two functions lying between any assigned limits. Syzygetic.-A syzygetic function or conjunctive of a number of given rational integral functions is the sum of these affected respectively with arbitrary functional multipliers, which are termed the syzygetic multipliers. When a syzygetic function of a given set of functions can be made to vanish, they are said to be syzygetically related. Transform.-Equivalent to the French noun substantive " transforme'e." TIpe.-The type of a cumulant is the series of the simple elements (or quotients), arranged in a fixed order, of which the cunulant is composed. Urnbral.-The umbral notation is a notation according to which simple quantities are denoted by syllables, instead of by single letters (the composition of these syllables being governed by the mode in which the quantities which they express are obtained); and the single letters of such syllables are termed umbral quantities or umbrce. Weight.-In this memoir (throughout the earlier sections) the weight of any quantity composed of the product of the coefficients of any given function or functions of x is used to denote the number of roots of x appertaining to the given function or functions which must be employed to express such quantity. More generally, when dealing with a system of homogeneous functions, 548 GLOSSARY OF NEW OR UNUSUAL TERMS. the weight of a quantity may be defined with respect to any selected variable therein as the sum of the weights in respect to such variable of the several coefficients of which the quantity is composed (the weight of each several coefficient meaning the index of the power of the selected variable in that term of the given function or functions which is affected with such coefficient). These two definitions of weight may be perfectly well reconciled with each other by understanding the weight of a quantity formed from the coefficients of a function or system of functions of x to mean the weight, in respect to unity, of such quantity when the given functions are treated as homogeneous functions of x and 1. Zeta.-The symbol O (preceding a row of bracketed terms) is used to denote the product of the squared differences of the terms which it affects. [ ]. A bracket of this form, when enclosing a superior and an inferior row of terms m and n in number respectively, indicates the mn products of the differences obtained by subtracting each term in the second row from each term in the first row; when enclosing an arrangement of terms in a single line, it is used to denote the cumulant of which such an arrangement is the type.
