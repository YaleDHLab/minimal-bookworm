250j XVII. On a method of expressing by signs the action of machinery By CHARLES BABBAGE, Esq. F. R. S. Communicated'January 17, 1826. Read March i6, 1826. IN the construction of an engine, on which I have now been for some time occupied, for the purpose of calculating tables and impressing the results on plates of copper, I experienced great delay and inconvenience from the difficulty of ascertaining from the drawings the state of motion or rest of any individual part at any given instant of time : and if it became necessary to enquire into the state of several parts at the same moment the labour was much encreased. In the description of machinery by means of drawings, it iJs only possible to represent an engine in one particular state of its action. If indeed it is very simple in its operations, a succession of drawings may be made of it in each state of its progress which will represent its whole course but this rarely happens, and is attended with the inconvenience and expence of numerous drawings. The difficulty of retaining in the mind all the cotemporaneous and successive movements of a complicated machine, and the still greater difficulty of properly timing movements which had already been provided for, induced me to seek for some method by which I might at a glance of the eye select any particular part, and find at any given time its state of motion or rest, its relation to the motions of any other part of the machine, and if Mr. BABBAGE on a method of expressing, &c. 251 necessary trace back the sources of its movement through all its successive stages to the original moving power. I soon felt that the forms of ordinary language were far too diffuse to admit of any expectation of removing the difficulty, and being convinced from experience of the vast power which analysis derives from the great condensationr of meaning in the language it employs, I was not long in deciding: that the most favourable path to pursue was to have recourse to the language of signs. It then became necessary to contrive a notation which ought if possible to be at once simple and expressive easily understood at the commencement, id capable of being readily retained in the memory from the proper adaptation of -the signs to the circumstances they were intended to represent. The first thing to be done was obviously to make an accurate enumeration of all the moving parts, and to appropriate a name to each; the multitude of different contrivances in various machinery, precluded all idea of substituting signs for these parts. They were therefore written down in succession, only observing to preserve such an order that those which jointly concur for accomplishing the effect of any separate part of the machine might be found situated near to each other: thus in a clock, those parts which belong to the striking part ought to be placed together, whilst those by which the repeating part operates ought, although kept distinct, yet to be as a whole, adjacent to the former part. Each of these names is attached to a faint line which, runs longitudinally down the page, and which may for the sake of reference be called its indicating line. The next object was to connect thenotation with theSUB2 Mr. BABBAGE on a method of expressing drawings of the machine, in order that the two might mu. tually illustrate and explain each other. It is convenient in the three representations of a machine, to employ the same letters for each part; in order to connect these with the notations, the letters which in the several drawings refer to the same parts, are placed upon the indicating lines immediately under the names of the things. if circumstances should prevent us from adhering to this rule, it would be desirable to mark those things represented in the plan by the ordinary letters of the alphabet, those pointed out for one of the other projections by the letters of an accented alphabet, and the parts delineated on the th;a sI projection by a doubly accented alphabet. In engines of so complicated a nature as to require sections at various parts as well as the three projections, this system is equally applicable, and its advantage consists in this-that the number of accents on the letter indicates at once the number of the drawing on which it appears, and when it is intended to refer to several at the same time, the requisite letters may be employed and placed in the order in which the drawings will best illustrate the part under examination. The next circumstance which can be indicated by the system of mechanical notation which I propose, more readily than by drawings, is the number of teeth on each wheel or sector, or the number of pins or studs on any revolving barrel. A line immediately succeeding that which contains the references to the drawings is devoted to this purpose, and on each vertical line indicating any particular part of the machine, is written the number of teeth belonging to it. As there is generally a great variety of parts of machinery which by szgns the action of machinery. do not consist of teeth; of course every vertical line will not have a number attached to it. The -three lines immediately succeeding this, are devoted to the indication of the velocities of the several parts of the machine. The first must have, on the indicating line of all those parts which have a rectilinear motion, numbers expressing the velocity with which those parts move, and if this velocity is variable, two numbers should be written, one expressing the greatest, the other the least velocity of the part. The second line must have numbers expressing the angular velocity of all those parts which revolve ; the time of revoluion of some one of them being taken as the unit of the measure of angular velocity. It sometimes happens that two wheels have the same angular velocity when they move; but from the structure Of the machine, one of them rests one half of the time during which the other is in action. In this case, although their angular velocities are equal, their comparative velocities are as 1 to 2 ; for the second wheel makes two revolutions, whilst the other only makes one, A line is devoted to the numbers which thus arise, and it is entitled, Comparative Angular Velocity. The next object to be considered is the course through which the moving power is transmitted, and the particular modes by which each part derives its movement from that immediately preceding it in the order of action. The sign which I have chosen to indicate this transmission of motion (an arrow), is one very generally employed to denote the direction of motion in mechanical drawings; it will therefore readily suggest the direction in which the movement is transmitted. There are however various ways by which MDCCCXXVI. L I 254 Mr. BABBAGE on a method of expressing motion is communicated; and it becomes a matter of some importance to consider whether, without interfering with the sign just selected, some modification might not be introduced into its minor parts, which, leaving it unaltered in the general form, should yet indicate the peculiar nature of the means by which the movement is accomplished. On enumerating those modes in which motion is usually communicated, it appeared that they may be reduced to the following. One piece may receive its] motion from another by being This may be indicated by an permanently attached to it as ai arrow with a bar at the end. pin on a wheel, or a wheel and pinion on the same axis. J One piece -may be driven by] another in such a manner that when the driver moves, the other An arrow without any bar. also always moves; as happens when a wheel is driven by a pinion. j An arrow formed of a line irkOne thing may be attached to . . > ~~ter rupt~ed by dots. another by stiff friction. } One piece may be driven by By an arrow, the first half of another, and yet not always move . which is a full line, and the when the latter moves; as is the second half a dotted one. case when a stud lifts a bolt once in the course of its revolution. One wheel may be connected with another by a ratchet, as the Byadottedarrowwitharatchet great wheel of a clock is attached tooth at its end. to the fusee. N *by sg'ns the action of machinery. Each of the vertical lines, representing any part of the machine, must now be connected with that representing the part from which it receives its movement, by an arrow of such a kind as the preceding table indicates.; and if any part derives motion from two or more sources, it must be connected by the proper arrows with each origin of its movement. It will in some cases contribute to the better understanding of the machine, if those parts which derive movement from two or more sources have their names connected by a bracket, with two or more vertical lines, which may be employed to indicate the different motions separately. Thusif a shaft has a circular as well as a longitudinal motion, the two lines attached to its name should be characterised by a distinguishing mark, such as (vert. motion) and (circ. motion). Whenever any two or more motions take place at the same time, this is essential ; and when they do not, it is convenient for the purpose of distinguishing them. All machines require, after their parts are finished and put together, certain alterations which arecalled adjustments. Some of these are permanent, and, when once fixed by the maker, require no further care. Others depend on the nature of the work they are intended to perform,'as in the instance of a corn mill; the distance between the stones is altered according to the fineness of the flour to be ground: these may be called usual adjustments; whilst there are others depending on the winding up of a weight, or spring, which may be called periodic adjustments. As it is very desirable to know all the adjustments of a machine, a space is reserved, below that in which the -connections of the moving parts are exhibited, where these may be indicated; if there are many 256 Mr. BABBAGE o a method of expressing adjustments, this space may be subdivided into three, and appropriated to each of the three species just enumerated, the permanent, the usual, and the periodic: if their number is small, it is better merely to distinguish them by a modification of their signs. It is sometimes impossible to perform such adjustment, except in a particular succession; and it is always convenient to, adhere to one particular order. Numbers attached to their respective lines denote the order in which the parts are to be adjusted ; and as it will sometimes happen that two or more adjustments must be made at the same time, in that case the same numbers must be written on the lines belonging to all those parts which it is necessary to adjust simultaneously. If it is convenient to distinguishbetween the species of adjustments without separating them by lines, this may be accomplished by putting a line above or below the figures, or inclosing them in a circle, or by some similar mode. I have attached the letter P to those which are periodic. It would add to the knowlege thus conveyed, if the sign indicating adjustment also gave us some information respecting its nature; there are, however, so many different species, that it is perhaps better in the first instance to confine ourselves to a few of the most common, and to leave to those whom may have occasion to employ this kind of notation, the contrivance of signs, fitted for their more immediate purpose. One of the most common adjustments is that of determining the distance between two parts, as between the point of suspension and the centre of oscillation of a pendulum. This might be indicated by a small line crossing the vertical by signs the action of machinery. 257 line attached to the part. If the distance between two parts, which are represented by different lines, is to be altered, their lines may be connected by an horizontal line. AD Thus the adjustment of A in the above figure depends on its distance from D. This adjustment often determines the length of a stroke, and sometimes the eccentricity of an eccentric, which depends on the linear distance between its centre and its centre of motion. The next most frequently occurring adjustment is that which is sometimes necessary in fixing two wheels, or a wheel and an arm on the same axis. This relation of angular position, may be indicated by a circle and two radii placed at the requisite angle, or that angle may be stated in figures and inclosed within the circle; this circle ought however to be connected by a line with the other part, with which the angle is to be formed, thus, A B c D E F which means that an adjustment is to be made by fixing A on its axis, making a right angle with D, and that F must also make with C an angle of sixty degrees. In speaking of these angles, it should always be observed that they refer to the angles made by the parts on one of the planes of projection. 2t8 Mr. BABBAGE on a method of expressing When it is thought requisite to enter into this minute detail of adjustments, it will be necessary, in order to avoid confusion, to put thelines indicating the order of adjustment, above and distinct from these signs. The last and most essential circumstance to be represented, is the succession of the movements which take place in the working of the machine. Almost all machinery, after a certain number of successive operations, recommences the same eourse which it had just completed, and the work which it performs usually consists of a multitude of repetitions of the same course of particular motions, It is one of the great objects of the notation I an now expladning, to point out a, method by which, at any instant of time in this course or cycle of operations of any machine, we may know the state of motion or rest of every particular part;, to present a picture by which we may, on inspection, see not only the motion at that moment of time, but the whole history of its movements, as well as that of all the cotemporaneous changes from the beginning of the cycle. In order to accomplish this, each of the vertical indicating lines representing any part of the machine, has, adjacent to it, other lines drawn in the same direction: these accompanying lines denote the state of motion or rest of the part to which they refer, according to the following rules. i. Unbroken lines indicate motion. 2. Lines on the right side indicate that the motion is from right to left. . Lines on the left side indicate that the direction of the motion is from left to right. by sins the action of machinery. 4. If the movements are such as not to admit of this distinction, then when lines are drawn adjacent to an indicating line, and on opposite sides of it, they signify motions in opposite directions. . Parallel straight lines denote uniform motion. ( 6. Curved lines denote a variable velocity. It is convenient as far as possible to make the ordinates of the curve proportional to the different velocities. 7. If the motion may be greater or less within certain limits: then if the motion begin at a fixed moment of time, and it is uncertain when it will terminate, the line denoting motion must extend from one limit, to the other, and must be connected by a small cross line at its commencement with the indicating line. If the beginning of its motion is uncertain, but its end determined, then the cross line must be at its termination. If the commencement and the termination of any motion are both uncertain, the line representing motion must be connected with the indicating line in the middle by a cross line. 8. Dotted lines imply rest. It is convenient sometimes to denote a state of rest by the absence of any line whatever. 9. If the thing indicated be a click, bolt, or valve, its dotted line should be on the right side if it is out of action, unbolted, or open, and on the left side if the reverse is the case. 260 Mr.. BABBAGE on a method of expressing 1o. If a bolt may rest in three positions: st, bolted on the right side; 2nd, unbolted; 3rd, bolted on the left side, When it is unbolted, and in the middle station, use two lines whilst in the act of unbolting, and two lines of dots, one on each side : 1 of, and close to the indicating line, whilst it rests in this position. When it is bolted on the right I ! side, a line or a line of dots at a greater distance : on the right hand from the indicating line will represent it. And if it is bolted on the left, a similar mode of denoting it must be used on that side. Any explanation may, if required, be put in words at the end of the notation, as will be observed in that of the hydraulic ram, Plate IV. I have now explained means of denoting by signs almost all those circumstances which usually occur in the motion of machinery: if other modifications of movement should present themselves, it will not be difficult for any one who has rendered himself familiar with the symbols employed in this Paper, to contrive others adapted tQ the new combinations which may present themselves. The two machines which I have selected as illustrations of the application of this method, are, the common eight day clock, and the hydraulic ram. The former 'was made choice of from its construction being very generally known, and I was induced to choose the latter from the apparent difficulty of applying this method to its operations. The advantages which appear to result from the employment of this mechanical notation, are to render the description of machinery considerably shorter than it can be when ex by signs the action of machinery. 261 pressed in words. The signs, if they have been properly chosen, and if they should be generally adopted, will form -as it were an universal language; and to those who become skilful in their use, they will supply the means of writing down at sight even the most complicated machine, and of understanding the order and succession of the movements of any engine of which they possess the drawings and the mechanical notation. In contriving machinery, in which it is necessary that numerous wheels and levers, deriving their motion from distant parts of the engine, should concur at some instant of time, or in some precise order, for the proper performance of a particular operation, it furnishes most important assistance; and I have myself experienced the advantages of its application to my own calculating engine, when all other methods appeared nearly hopeless. DESCRIPTION OF THE PLATES. Plates VII. and VIII. are different representations of an eight day clock, for the purpose of comparing it with the notation. Plate IX. represents the mechanical notation of the same clock. Under the names of each part follow the letters which distinguish them in the plates. The next line contains numbers which mark the number of teeth in each wheel, pinion, or sector. The following line is intended to contain numbers expressing the linear velocity of the different parts: in the eight day clock this line is vacant, because almost all the motions are circular. The next line indicates the angular velocity of each part; MrcccxxvIO M m IG2 Mr. BABBAGE on a method of expressing and in order to render the velocity of the striking parts comparable with those of the timepart, I have supposed one, revolution of the striking fusee to be made in one minute: I have -also taken one revolution of the scapement wheel, or one minute of time as the unit of angular velocity.The space entitled comparative angular velocity, expresses the number of revolutions one wheel makes during one revolution of some other; it differs from the real angular velocity because one wheel may! be at rest during part of the time. Thus the clock strikes 78 strokes during twelve hours, or one revolution of the hour hand: if this be called unity, the pin wheel moves through 78 pins or 91 revolutions In the same time; its comparative angular velocity is therefore 9g. The space in which the origin of motion is given, will not require any explanation after reading the description of the signs employed in this paper. Theadjustments are numbered in the order in which they are to be made. No. 1, is attached to the crutch: the first adjustment is to set the clock in beat. No.2, is to adjust the length of the pendulum to beat seconds. No. a, occurs in three different places, at the hour and minute hands, and at the snail on the hour wheel. It is necessary that when the hour hand is at a given figure, three o'clock forinstance, that the minute hand should be set to, twelve o'clock; it is also necessary that the snail should be in such. a position that the clock may strike three. These adjustments must be made at the same time. No., 4, is for, the adjustment of the seconds hand to 6o seconds. No. 5, is double, and is for the adjustment of the minute and hour hand to the next whole ftMa. 7PUIh. MUCCCXWL a/. F . p.

No. 6, is for the pendulum, which must be held aside at its extreme arc until the instant at which the watch reaches the time set on the face of the clock it must then be set free. The remaining part of the notation indicates the action of every part at all times; but as the whole cycle of twelve hours would occupy too much space, a portion only is given about the hour of four: from this the machine may be sufficiently understood. As an instance of its use, let us enquire what movements are taking place at seven seconds after four o'clock. On looking down on the left hand side to the time just mentioned, we observe between the end of the sixth, and end of the seventh second, that the pendulum and crutch begin to move from the right to the left, increasing their velocity to a maximum, and then diminishing it; that the whole train of wheels of the time part are at rest during the greater part of that second, and all move simultaneously a little before its termination. The greater part of the train of the striking part 'is moving uniformly; but two parts the cross piece, and the other moving the hammer, being at the commencement of this second in a state of motion from right to left, suddenly have that motion reversed for a short time: this is at the moment of striking: two other pieces, the hawk's bill, and the gathering pallet, appears to act at the same moment. If the course of movement of any one part is required throughout the whole cycle of the machine's action,we have only to follow its indicating line, If it is required to find what motions take place at the same time, we have only to look along the horizontal line marked by the time specified. ?64 Mr. BABBAGE on a method of expressing Let us now enquire into the source of motion of the minute hand. On looking down to the space in which the origin of motion is given, we observe an arrow point,, which conveys us to the Cannon pinion, with which it is connected permanently. The cannon pinion is driven by the centre or hour wheel, with which it is connected by stiff friction. The hour wheel is driven by its pinion, to which it is permanently attached. The hour wheel pinion is driven by the great wheel, into which it works. The great wheel is driven by the fusee, with which it is connected by a ratchet. The fusee is driven by the spring barrel or main spring,> which is the origin of all the movements. When that part of the notation which relates to the suck cessive movements of the machine is of considerable extent, it is convenient to write on a separate piece of paper the names of every part, at the same distances from each other as the indicating lines, and exactly as they are placed at the top. By sliding this paper down the page to any part which is under consideration, the trouble of continual reference to the top of the drawing will be avoided. Plate X. represents the hydraulic ram: its mechanical notation is added below it.. A, is the supplying pipe. B, is the great valve. C, the valve into the air vesselD, the air vessel. E, the ascending water. F, the small air valve :.its office is to supply a small by signs the action of machinery. 266 quantity of air at each stroke; it opens when the valve C is just closed, and a regurgitation takes place in the supplying pipe just previous to the opening of the great valve. Without this contrivance, the pressure on the air in the air vessel would cause it to be soon absorbed by the water, and the engine would cease to act. In this notation two indicating lines A, A, are allowed to the supplying water, because it takes three different courses .during the action of the machine. The first of these marks the time of its motion when it enters the air vessel, and the second indicates its course when passing through the great valve, and also its course when, owing to the elasticity of the materials, its motion is for an instant reversed, at which moment air is taken in at the air valve F. The action of the machine is as follows: the supplying. 'water rushing along the great pipe passes out at the great valve; it acquires velocity until the pressure of the effluent, water against the under part of the great valve causes it to close suddenly At this moment the whole momentum of the water is directed against the sides of the machine, and. the air valve being the weakest part gives way, and admits. a small quantity of water; the air spring soon resists sufficiently to close the air valve: at this moment the elasticity of the apparatus re-acting on the water in the great pipe,, drives it back for an instant, during which the pressure of the atmosphere opens the air valve, and a small quantity of air enters; this finds its way to the air chambers, which easily discharges it through the ascending pipe if too much air has entered.
