An Intimation of a Way, found in Europe to make China-dishes. Notice was lately given by an inquisitive Parisian to a friend of his in London, that by an Acquaintance he had been informed, that Signor Septalio, a Canon in Millan, had the Secret of making as good Porcelane as is made in China it self, and transparent; adding that he had seen him make some. This as it deserves, so it will be further inquired after, if God permit.
