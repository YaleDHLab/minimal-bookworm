Of a place in England, where, without petrifying Water, Wood is turned into Stone. The same Searcher of Nature, that was alledged in the immediately precedent Observations, did impart also the following, in another Letter from Oxford, where he saith: I was a while since visited by a Gentleman, who tells me, That he met with a Place in these parts of England, where, though there be no petrefying Spring (for that I particularly asked) Wood is turned into Stone in the Sandy Earth it self, after a better manner then by any Water I have yet seen: For I had the Curiosity to go to look upon pieces of Wood, he brought thence, and hope for the opportunity of making some tryals to examine the matter a little further, then I have yet been able to do. Thus far that Letter. Since which time, He was pleased to give this further Information of the same matter, with a Mantissa of some other Particulars, belonging to this Subject, in these Words. I was lately making some Tryals with the petrifyed Wood I told you off, which I finde to be a very odde substance, wonderfully hard and fixed. If I had opportunity to Re-print the History of Fluidity and Firmness, I could adde divers things about Stones, that perhaps would not be disliked; and I hope, if God vouchsafe me a little leisure, to (102) to insert several of them in fit places of that History, against the next Edition. Here is a certain Stone, that is thought to be petrefyed Bone, being shap'd like a Bone, with the Marrow taken out; but with a fit Menstruum, I found that I could easily dissolve it, like other soft Stones: and possibly it may prove as fit as Osteocolla, for the same Medicinal Uses.
