45 ] VI. On the Laws of Individual Tides at Southampton and at Ipswich. By G. B. AIRY, Esq., IW.A., F.R.S., Astronomer Royal. Received February 16,-Read March 2, 1843. 'WITH the view of verifying the reported peculiarity in the tides at Southampton, I had proposed in the month of February 1842 to proceed thither for the purpose of examining, with my own eyes, the rise and fall of the water during one or more tides. As soon, however, as my purpose was made known to Colonel COLBY, R.E., Director of the Trigonometrical Survey, and to Lieutenant YOLLAND, R.E., the Resident Officer at the Ordnance Map Office, Southampton, I received from those gentlemen the offer of placing at my service, for these observations, non-commissioned officers and privates of the corps of Royal Sappers and Miners, as well as of preparing and fixing the vertical scale of feet and inches, and of keeping a watch upon the general accuracy of the observed times. I was extremely glad to avail myself of this offer, for I believe that a more intelligent and faithful body of men does not exist than the Sappers employed in the Trigonometrical Survey; and I knew well the advantage of employing, upon a tedious business like this, a set of regular-service men stationed on the spot. A vertical scale of deal laths, upon which the divisions and figures were branded was fixed near the end of the pier at Southampton, very near to the landing-stairs on the north side of the pier, so that the divisions could at all stages of the tide (with the assistance of a lantern at night) be easily read by a person standing on the stairs. The order of the graduations of the scale was increasing from the bottom upwards, and the zero of the scale was found, by levelling, to bear the following relation to certain fixed marks:[The mark in each case, except that of St. Paul's Church, is a horizontal cut, indicated by the point of an arrow. The arrow is on one side of the mark at Holyrood Church, and below each of the others.] The zero of the scale is, Below a mark cut on the metal of the coat of arms on the north side of the feet. pedestal of CHAMBERLAYNE'S column, Watergate Quay. . . } 5165 Below the ground at the same place.. 21990 Below a mark cut in the stone jamb on the south side of the centre door of) Holyrood Church .36,31]0 Below the floor of the portico. 33 370 46 MR.

Trhe watch 'by which the times were taken was a pocket chronometer belonging to Lieutenant YOLLAND, of which the error was small. The observations at February 24, 6h 5m and 6h IOm, were omitted from inadvertence (darkness coming on before proper preparations were -made); those of February 24, 6h 35m and 6h 40m, were excluded from calculation, because the water was disturbed by a boat; and those of February 25, 2h On, 2h 5m, and 2h I1n0 because they were evidently irregular, although no reason was assigned for their irregularity. When the seven complete tides embraced by these observations were laid down in graphical projection, each of them presented a curve similar in its general form to the extraordinary figure represented in the diagram, fig. 1. in Plate II.; four of the curves having three maxima of elevation in each tide. In the first two tides, the first maximum, as in the diagram fig. 1, was rather a stand-still in the rise than a rise and fall; and in the last tide (the highest of all), the first and third maxima were both of this character. In all the others the three maxima to each tide were well marked. On February 2 from 15b to 17h, the wind blew strong from W. and S.W. On February 25, from 18h to 19h, it blew a gale from S.W. and W. From February 25, 2 Ilh, to February 26, 3h, the wind was strong from S.W. and W. And from February 26, 20h to 23h, there was a strong W.S.W. wind. At other times the air was almost perfectly calm. These changes in the state of the atmosphere do not appear to have produced any sensible alteration in the character of the individual tides. The epochs and magnitudes of the tides appear, however, to have been sensibly altered by these or other disturbing causes. Thus, if we examine the times and intervals of high water, they are as follows:011 %' ' ~~~~~~~I I 'I ' ' ' ' I I T 1 I . 1 1 , 4~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ I e I j g~ ~ ---_______ ---/ 4 I X1 I~ o-. -r...

Nevertheless, the tidal curves for the tides on both sides of that low water are undistinguishable, as viewed by the eye, from the rest; and in the grouping for the reductions, to be shortly explained, the numbers furnished by them do not differ sensibly from those given by the others. Considering it then as established that the peculiarities in these tidal curves are the representatives of real peculiarities in the tides at Southampton (such as may always be expected in every individual tide of nearly the same magnitude as those observed on this occasion), and in no degree due to the accidental circumstances of weather; and considering also that these tides -exhibit no certain trace of diurnal tide; I shall proceed to explain the method by which they have been reduced into mathematical form. The method is, in many respects, similar to that which I used for the Deptford tides, in a paper published in the Philosophical Transactions for 1842. The first step was, to divide the whole series of observations into groups, each group representing one tide. This was done by taking the interval from low water to low water as one tide, and supposing it to correspond to 360 of phase, and converting the interval between every observation in that tide and its commencement into phase, by that proportion. The next step was to reduce the different observations of height to one uniform scale. This was done by assuming every range of tide, from high water to low water or from low water to high water, to be represented by 2, and converting the depression of the water at every observation below the high water of that tide into abstract number, by that proportion. In this manner every observation gave a phase expressed. in degrees, and a converted depression expressed in abstract number. The next step was to collect fro-m all the tides the. phases between 0? and 50 and their AT SOUTHAMPTON AND AT IPSWICH. 49 corresponding converted depressions, and to take their mean; then those between 50 and 10,; and so on. The phases thus obtained differed little from 2?.5, 70.5, &c.; and the correction of converted depression for these small differences being easily found from the preceding and following numbers, the converted depressions for 20.5, 70 5, &c. were found. In this manner the following Table was formed:Corresponding phases and converted depressions in the Southampton Tides; the phase commencing with low woater and increasing by 3600 in one tide; and the depression being measured from high water, the whole range being called 2 000.

To express these numbers in a mathemr atical form by means of a periodic function, it was assumed that the converted depression could be represented by the formula A + B . sin phase + C . sin 2 phase + D . sin 3 phase + E . sin 4 phase, + b . cos phase + c . cos 2 phase + d . cos 3 phase + e. cos 4 phase. Then A is the mean of all the converted depressions. B is found by multiplying every converted depression by its value of sin phase, and dividing the sum of all the products by 36. b is found in the same way, using the values of cos phase as factors. C is found by using sin 2 phase as factor, &c. In this manner the following expression was found for the converted depression:0900 + 0'469 . sin phase0'085 .sin 2 phase0'057. sin 3 phase0017. sin 4 phase + 0'766 . cos phase + 0'174 . cos2 phase + 0 182. cos 3 phase 0^029 . cos 4 phase; or 0-900 + 0'898 . sin (phase + 580 30') + 0^194 . sin (2 phase + 1160) + 0'191 . sin (3 phase + 1070 22') -0'034 . sin (4 phase + 59? 43'). MDCCCXLIII, H 50 MR. AIRY ON THE LAWS OF INDIVIDUAL TIDES If we make phase + 580.301 p, this becomes 0 900 + 0,898. sinp + 0 194 .-sin (2 p 1I0) + 0 191 . (sin 3p 680 8') -. 0034.sin (4p -1740 17'). The theory of waves, so far as it has yet gone, fails to explain the form of this expression. It is not reconcileable with that obtained on, the supposition that the extent of vertical oscillation bears a sensible proportion to the depth, either when the length of the channel is indefinite, or when the channel is interrupted by a barrier*. The latter supposition is that which would seem to. represent most exactly the circumstances of Southampton. It is to be remarked, however, that the investigations which I have cited suppose the section of the channel to be rectangular; a supposition which accords little with the state of the channel of the Southampton water, as shown by the extensive banks of mud discovered at low water there. The investigations also exclude friction. The following consideration is suggested by the form of the expression at which we have arrived for the converted depression. If the tide were such as we suppose the sea-tide to be (that is, if its depression were expressed by a single sine or cosine), and if (as above) the phase were measured from low water, then the converted depression would be expressed by A' + B' cos phase, or A' + B' sin (phase + 900). From this we might be led to .conceive. that in all cases the argument of the principal term expressing the depression would be (phase + 900), the phase being a quantity which commences from low water. .But we find that it does in this instance depend on (phase + 580 30'), or on (phase + 900 31'30'), differing from the former by 310 30', which corresponds to one hour of time nearly. Now there seems to be no reason (except the convenience of mariners) why cotidal lines and speculations on the progress of the tide should be connected with high water rather than with low water, or any other phase of tide ; the only thing with which, in a scientific view, they can properly be connected (as it appears to me), is the epoch of the argument of the principal term in the formula for depression. But, in the instance of Southampton, the time of actual low water differs from the time of greatest depression given by that term, by one hour; the times of high water differ about forty minutes. If then the peculiarity of the Southampton tide has been created in part by the shallowness of the English, channel, and exists on the coast (we have no accurate information whether this is true or not), then the position of the cotidal line determined by the high water is erroneous, with reference to the views above mentioned, to a considerable extent. Another consideration suggested by the same expression is this. The mean of the depressions at high-water and at low-water is 1000. But the constant term which enters into the general formula for the depression is 0,900. Now I conceive the latter to be the number which truly represents the mean level of the water. In all cases,* See Philosophical Transactions, 1842, p. 6. AT SOUTHAMPTON AND AT IPSWICH. 51 therefore, in which the mean level of the sea in different places is compared, I conlceive it is not sufficient to take the mean of high and low water, but it is necessary to express the depression by the formula A + B sin phase + b cos phase + C sin 2 phase + &c., and to adopt the constant A as determining the mean level. The difference, at Southampton, is about nine inches, by which quantity the mean level, as defined above, is higher than the mean of high and low waters. The singularity of the results obtained at Southampton induced me to take measures for observing the tides in another estuary; and for this purpose I selected Ipswich as a good station. The positions of these places are not exactly similar: Southampton is nearly at the head of its gulf; Ipswich may be considered as being absolutely at the head of its gulf. The length of the Orwell does not differ materially from that of the Southampton water; and in depth, breadth, magnitude of tide, &c., it resembles it closely. Nevertheless, it will appear from the following results that the laws of the tides at these two places are extremely different. An application made by me to CHARLES MAY, Esq. of Ipswich, was by him laid before the Dock Committee; and I received from that body a most courteous offer of every assistance which could be required for the observation of the tides. The immediate superintendence of the observations was undertaken by JAMES JONES, Esq., Dockmaster; and to the talent and spirit with which this gentleman undertook the troublesome business, I am entirely indebted for the opportunity of presenting the Royal Society with trustworthy results. The observations commenced on 1842, May 24, 2311 40m (astronomical reckoning), and finished on May 27, 3h 35m; embracing four complete tides. The height of the water was observed at every five minutes. The zero of the scale is the Lock Sill. Great attention was given to the determination of time., No irregularity appears on the face of the observations except about May 25, 19gh, after a heavy squall from the S.S.E. with violent rain.

The first three terms of this expression are extremely similar to those in the expression for the Southampton tide: the principal difference between the two expressions isin the fourth term, or that depending on 3 p. It is very remarkable that the algebraical difference between the formulae for tides which are so strikingly different in general character, depends entirely on a term of the third order of the fraction expressing the proportion of the vertical oscillation to the depth of the water; an order to which (so far as I am aware) theory has reached only in one instance, namely that of a wave travelling along an unlimited canal, and then only on the restricted suppositions of rectangular section and absence of friction*. It is also worthy of remark, that the termns of the second order. (10 not agree with those given by the restricted theory to which I have alluded, and that they differ materially from those given by the Deptford tidest. From a consideration of the discordance between the observa-n tions and the present state of theory in regard to the form of these terms, as well as from remarking the influence which they have upon cotidal lines and mean levels, I am inclined to fix upon the circumstances of waves in canals as more deserving of notice at the present time, both in theory and in observation, than almost any other branch of the theory of tides. I take this opportunity of correcting an error in mny paper on the Deptford tides++ I have there stated, on the authority of Mr. WHEWELL?, that the age of the tide as inferred from the heights is greater than its age as inferred from the times. This, however, is incorrect. The age inferred from the heights is, in every instance that has been properly examined, less than that inferred from the times 11. I trust that, in a subject which is at first examination very confusing, it will be regarded as a venial fault to have erred in such company as that of Mr. WHEWELL. In a theoretical-view, this correction is very important.

Some other cause must therefore exist, of such, a kind, as to make the tide later in springs than in neaps, and of such a magnitude as. completely to overrule that already assigned. I conceive that this cause may be the increased range of the tide in horizontal extent up the river, at springs; by which the tide is changed from a gulf-tide to a continuous-canal-tide, which travels more slowly. But without more rigorous theory, I dare not pronounce upon this point. Royal Observatory, Greenwich, February loth, 1843.* Philosophical Transactions, 1842, p. 8.
