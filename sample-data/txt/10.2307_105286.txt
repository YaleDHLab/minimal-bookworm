LXI. Remarks on the different Temperature of the Air at Edystone, from that observed at Plymouth, between the 7th and 14th of July 1757. By Mr. John Smeaton, F. R. S. S I R, ON the reading of Dr. Huxham's letter at the last meeting, some observations occurred to me, concerning the different temperature of the air, which I had observed at the Edystone, from what had been observed by the Doctor at Plymouth, between the 7th and 14th of July Read Jan. 12, 1758. the excessive heat: and indeed, it was not long before I had reason to join in their opinion. This heat I experienced till Tuesday the 12th, when I again went off to sea, where I found the air VOL. 50. R r r very [490] very temperate, rather cool than warm; and so continued till Thursday the 14th. In my journal for Wednesday the 13th I find the following remarks, viz. ``This evening's tide'' (from 6 A. till 12 A.) `` the wind at east, but moderate, `` with frequent flashes of lightning to the south`` ward. Soon after we got on board the store`` vessel, a squall of wind arose from the south-west `` on a sudden, and continued for about a minute; `` part of which time it blew so hard, we expected `` the masts to go by the board: after which it was `` perfectly calm, and presently after a breeze re`` turned from the east.'' And in the journal of the 14th is entered, ``This `` morning's tide'' (viz. from 1 M. to 1 A.) `` the `` air and sea quite calm.'' Hence it appears, how different the temper of the air may be in a small distance; and to what small spaces squalls of wind are sometimes confined. It may not be amiss further to observe upon this head, that once, in returning from Edystone, having got within about two miles of the Ramhead, we were becalmed; and here we rolled about for at least four hours; and yet at the same time saw vessels, not above a league from us, going out of Plymouth Sound with a fresh of wind, whose direction was towards us, as we could observe from the trim of their fails; and as we ourselves experienced, after we got into it by tacking and rowing. I am, Sir, <inferred>Farnival's</inferred>-Inn Court, 12th Jan. 1758. Your most humble Servant, J. Smeaton. LXII.
