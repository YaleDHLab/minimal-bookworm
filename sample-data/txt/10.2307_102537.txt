TAke of small thin Copper Pieces clean'd in the Fire ~ Aqua Fortis ~ being together in a Glass the Copper in Three or Four Hours will be dissolv'd, when 'tis cold you may use it, by washing with a Feather upon your Iron, that is presently made clean and smooth and it will presently take the Colour of Copper, when it cometh out with much rubbing you may renew it again, but if you do it twice together, the Iron will look black.
