[ 225 ] XI. On the Porism of the in-and-circumscribed Polygon. By ARTHUR CAYLEY, Esq., F.B.S. Received February 20,-Read March 7, 1861. THE Porism referred to is as follows, viz. that two conics may be so related to each other, that a polygon may be inscribed in the one, and circumscribed about the other conic, in such manner that any point whatever of the circumscribing conic may be taken for a vertex of the polygon. I gave in the year 1853, in the Philosophical Magazine*, a general formula for the relation between the two conics, viz. if U=O is the equation of the inscribed conic, V=O that of the circumscribed conic, and if disct. (U+WV), where a is an arbitrary multiplier, denotes the discriminant of U+EV in regard to the coordinates (x, Y, z) (such discriminant being of course a cubic function in regard to i, and also in regard to the coefficients of the two conics U, V, jointly), then if we write v'disct. (U+~V)=A+B+C +D g3+Eg4+Fg5+G96+&c., the relations for the cases of the triangle, pentagon, heptagon, &c. are C-0, C, D =0, C, Di E O. &c. D, E D E, F E, F, G respectively, while those in the cases of the quadrangle, hexagon, octagon, &c. are D-0, D E 0 D, E F =0, &c. E, F E, F, G F. G. H respectively. The demonstration of this fundamental theorem is for greater completeness here reproduced; but the chief object of the memoir is to direct attention to a curious analytical theorem which is an easy a przori consequence of the Porism, and to obtain the relations for the several polygons up to the enneagon, in a new and simple form which puts in evidence 'a posteriori for these cases the analytical theorem just referred to. The analytical theorem rests upon the following considerations:-the relation for a hexagon ought to include that for a triangle; in fact a triangle with its* See the papers-" On the Geometrical Representation of the Integral Sdx+-V(x+a)( +b) ( +c)," Phil.

CAYLEY ON THE PORISM OF sides in order twice over is a form of hexagon; the condition for an octagon should in like manner include that for a quadrangle; and so in other cases. Let the cubic function, disct. (U + EV), be represented by 1 +/3E+ 7 32+ ; the coefficients A, B, C, D, E, &c. are functions of 3, y, I. Write o D (4)~ C I D f =(5), |D, E |D, E (6) E, F C, D, E =(7), DI El F &c!. then (3), (4), (5) are respectively prime functions of 3 y', Y; that is they cannot be decomposed into factors, rational functions of these quantities; and it is convenient to denote this by writing (3)=[3], (4) =[4], (5)= [5]. But by what precedes, (6) contains the factor (3), that is [3]; and if the other factor, which is prime, is denoted by [6], then we have (6)=[6] [3]. The next term (7) is prime, that is we have (7)=[7f; but the term (8) gives (8)=[8] [4]; the term (9) gives (9)=[9] [3], and so on. Thus we have (12)=[12] [6] [43 [3], the numbers in [ ] being all the factors, the number itself included, and as well composite as prime, of the number in ( ), the factors 2 and 1 being however excluded. To make this clearer, it may be remarked that the last-mentioned equation has the geometrical signification that the relation for a dodecagon is the aggregate of the relations for a proper dodecagon, a proper hexagon, a quadrangle, and a triangle; that is, the relation for a dodecagon implies one or other of the lastmentioned relations. The relations for the several polygons up to the enneagon are in the memoir obtained in a form which puts in evidence the property in question, that is the series of equations (4) [4], (5)= [5] (6) =[6] [3], (7)=[7]9 (8)=[8] [4] (9)=[9] [3]. To do this, the discriminant is represented not as above in terms of the constants 03, y, 8but in a somewhat different form, by means of the constants 6, c, d, the last two THE IN-AND-CIRCUMSCRIBED POLYGON. 227 whereof are such that c=0 is the relation for the triangle, d=O the relation for the quadrangle; thus [3] -c, [4]=d, and for the particular cases considered, the analytical theorem consists herein, that c is a factor of (6), and of (9), and that d is a factor of (8). I have, for the sake of homogeneity, introduced into the formulae the quantity a (=1), but this is a matter of form only. The functions [3], [4], &c. have been spoken of as prie; they are so, in fact, as far as they are calculated; and that they are so in general rests on the assumption that for a polygon of a given number of sides, there is but one form of relation: if, for instance, in the equation [12]=0, which is the condition for a proper dodecagon, the function [12] could be decomposed into rational factors; then equating each of these factors to zero, we should have so many distinct forms of relation for a proper dodecagon. I believe that the assumption and reasoning are valid; but without entering further into this, I take it for granted that in the general case -the functions [3], [4], &c. are in fact prime. But the coefficients j3,) y, or b, c, d, instead of being so many independent arbitrary quantities, may be given as rational functions of other quantities (if, for instance, the two conics are circles, radii R, r, and distance between the centres a, then 03, y, will be functions of RI, r, a): and it is in a case of this kind quite conceivable that the functions [3], [4], &c., considered as functions of these new elements, should cease to be prime functions. In fact, in the case just referred to of the two circles (the original case of the Porism as considered by F}ss), the functions [4], [6], &c., which correspond to a -polygon of an even number of sides, appear to be each of them decomposable into two factors: the memoir contains some remarks tending to show a priori that in the case in question this decomposition takes place. I was led to examine the point by the elegant formulae obtained in an essentially different manner by M. MENTION, Bull. de l'Acad. de St. Pet. t. i. pp. 15, 30, and 507 (1860), in reference to the case of the two circles (it thereby appears that the decomposition takes place for the quadrangle and the hexagon); and these formulae are reproduced in the memoir. I. Demonstration of the general Formula of the Relation between the two Conies. The equation of a conic passing through the points of intersection of the conics U:O, V=O0 is of the form U+mV= 0X where m is an arbitrary parameter. Suppose that the conic touches a given line, we have for the determination of m a quadratic equation; and conversely, if the roots of this quadratic equation are given, the line is also given; that is, the two roots may be considered as parameters which determine the particular line. Let k be a given value of m; the parameters of any tangent of the conic U+kV-0 are k, p. but as k is common to all the tangents, we may consider the particular tangent 2xI2 228 MR. A. CAYLEY ON THE PORISM OF as determined by the single parameter. And a point of the conic U+kY=O may be considered as determined by the same parameter P which determines the tangent at that point. As regards the conic V 0, the common parameter for all its tangents is xo, and we may consider any other tangent of this conic as determined by the pararno, 1, and a point of the conic as determined by the same parameter d. Suppose, in the first instance, that the two conies are U ax2+by2+cz2=OI V= X2+ y2+ z2=0; the equation of the tangent of U+kV-O, the parameter whereof is p (in fact a common tangent of the conies U+kV=O, U+pV=O), is easily found to be Xb-c a~k,, a a y C -a V-kVb+ zC+kVc+p-O xv/ b c /6+ ksa+ + y/Ga/ kV p + +zv/ bVc 2cp=O and if this meet the conic V=0 in the points P, P', the parameters whereof are x, 0, and 0o, 0', or say d and d' respectively, then the coordinates of the point P are given by r: y: z =Vb-c a +0:c-a7b + d: Va b /c + d; and substituting these values in the foregoing equation, we have (b-c)Va +kVa+ps/a+d+(c-a)V6?kJb+rsb+O?(a-6) c +pV'c+d=O as an equation connecting the parametersp and d. This equation may be replaced by V(a+k)(a+p)(a+0)=X+va, V(b +k)(b +p)(b +O)=x+b, v/(c +k)(c +p)(c +6J)=x+(Jc, from which X, > are to be eliminated; and squaring and reducing, we have X'=abe+kp0, -2 = bc+ca+ab (pO+kp-kM), P2=a+b+c+k+_p+O, and thence (6c+ca+ab pt kp-kO)2 4(a+b+c+k+.p+4)(abc+kp) 0 as the rational form of the original equation. But the same rational equation would, it is clear, be obtained from the system V'(k+a)(k+ b)(k+c)=L+Mk, V(p+a)(p+b)(p+c)=L+Mp, (O + a)(O + b)(O + c)-=L+Md, by the elimination of L and M. And it follows from ABEL'S theorem (but the result might be verified by means of EULER'S fundamental theorem for the addition of elliptic functions), that if THE IN-AND-CIRIUMSCRIBED POLYGON. 229 then that the last-mentioned system is equivalent to the transcendental equation in which the arbitrary constant which should have been inserted, and the sign of 110, are determined by the consideration that for k=x (which gives Hk=O) we ought to have O=p, and therefore =10= Ip. There is of course a similar equation in D', and the terms with Ilk must be taken with opposite signs, and we have thence the theorem, "If 0, 0' are the parameters of the points P, P' in which the conic V= 0 is intersected by the tangent, the parameter whereof is p, of the conic U+kV=O, then the equations 11 = Vip-ik, Il1'= =p+-Hk, determine the parameters 0, 0' of the points in question." And again, "If the two variable parameters 0, 0' are connected by the equation 110'-I-0=21Hk, then the line PP' will be a tangent of the conic U+kV=0." The foregoing demonstration relates to the particular forms U= a2?+by2+cz, V= x2+y2+z2; but observing that the function \/(a+a)(e+b)(e+c), which enters under the integral sign in the transcendental function 11, is the square root of the discriminant of U+ V, the theory of covariants shows at once that the conclusions apply to any forms whatever of U, V, the expression for the transcendental function being V 1*diset. (U + (V) Consider now a triangle inscribed in the conic V=O, and with its sides touching the conics U+kV =0, U+k'V =0, U+k"V =0. Then if 0,0 ', 0" are the parameters of the angles, we have 110"" 1HO'= 21Hk, 110 -110'=21Jk', r10' 11 = 2 Hk", and thence Ilk +1k'+11k" =0 as the relation which must subsist between the parameters k, k',k1", of the conics touched by the sides; and similarly for a polygon of n sides; the relation between the para meters is 11k1+11ka + . ..+IHk-0? 230 MR. A. CAYLEY ON THE PORISM OF But by ABEL'S theorem, this transcendental equation is equivalent to an algebraical one. In fact, calling the radical VEwx, then if px, yx are rational and integral functions of x with arbitrary coefficients, and if p2x-tX2x0^'=A(x-kj)(x-k,)-.(x-k,,), (this implies that p2x is of a degree not exceeding n and t2xr of a degree not exceeding n-3; that is, for n even the degrees of px, zx are -n, 1(n -4); and for n odd they are -(nn-1), I({n3)), then the algebraical equation is that obtained by the elimination of the arbitrary coefficients from the system of equations *~~~~~k k+ Xkj S0 ki ,0 pk2+ k20 k2= 0, or, what is the same thing, for n odd -2p-1, it is {1, 0, .P"' V'O, avd/OOj ..OP-2V/O0}.0 and for n even, =2p, it is {1, 0, ... UP, 4/50, dp,/0, ..0P-2vfo0}0O where the expressions in { } denote respectively the determinants, of 2p 1 lines, and 2p lines, formed by substituting for d the values k,, k2, ... kn respectively. Thus for n= 3, the equation is 1, kl, O =; 1, Ac, /ok22 15 k35 O/k3 and for n-4, it is 1, k2, k2, 4/Ok2 1, k3, k, 2 /ok3 1, k4, 4/Ok4 and so on. Suppose =A+B+Q2+D?+E4+ ; then substituting the corresponding expressions for 4/0 k, 4/ok2, &c., the determinant will divide by {n1, 0, 02, .. t1'}, and it may be seen without difficulty that the resulting equation on putting therein k,=k2... =k.=0, will, according as n=3, 4, 5, 6, &c., be C0, D-0, C D =-0 D, E =0, C, D, E -0 &c., ltD, E El F DI E, F E,F, G which is the theorem above referred to. THE IN-AND-CIRCITMSIIRIBED POLYGON. 231 IL Application to the several Polygons up to the Emnieagon. If the equation of the inscribed conic is U=-O, and that of the circumscribed conic is V 0, and if the discriminant (U + IV) is in the first instance represented by 1+4p3+4y 2+4z3, then the square root of the discriminant is 1 + 2I3 + 2(7 !2)2 +2(32r+ 2I3)a2+& so that the condition for the triangle is y~.j2 0, and that for the quadrangle is 3 2@y+20f3=0. It is obviously convenient to introduce, into the formulae, in the place of y and AX the quantities d=Z-2/3r+2f33; and writing also, for symmetry of notation, b in the place of /3, we have -b; t =d+2bc, so that the discriminant will be w 1 + 4b + 4(c+ 2)f2+ 4(d+ 2bc)a!1 which is =(1 +2b6+2ce2)2+4(d'-c 2a4). But for homogeneity I introduce the quantity a--=1, and put the discriminant =(1+2bX+2aci2)2+ 4a2(dA3---4) The square root, divided by a2, is = -2 (1 + 2bE + 2acE2)V/1 + 4a2( da3C24) + (1 + 2{+ 2aca2)2; or developing, this is -2(1 +2bZ+ 2ac~) + 2, (d 3-c2V4) .

The foregoing values show that 23 and 1234 (which belong to the hexagon and the enneagon) divide by c (which belongs to the triangle), and that 234 (which belongs to the octagon) divides by d (which belongs to the quadrangle). But I was not prepared for the destruction which will be observed in the several determinants, of the terms involving the lower powers of a (that is, the terms of the highest orders in b, a, d), and which renders these expressions so much more simple than they would otherwise have been.

M. MENTION'S Formulw for the Case -of two Circles. In the case of two circles, if, as usual, the radii of the inscribed and circumscribed circles are put equal to r and R respectively, and the distance of their centres to a, then the equations of the inscribed and circumscribed circles respectively may be taken to be x2+y2_r 2-O (Sa)2 +,y2 2 and if, in the notation of M.

The relation between the two conics, or condition for the existence of the polygon, is the same whatever point of the circumscribed conic is taken as an angle of the polygon. Take for an angle, a point *of intersection of the two conics. Consider first the case of the triangle; if a point of intersection is taken as a vertex A of the triangle, then the sides AB, AC coincide in direction with the tangent at A to the inscribed conic U, hence B and C coincide together at the point where this tangent meets the circumscribed conic V, BC is therefore a tangent of V, but it is by hypothesis a tangent of U; hence for the triangle the relation between the inscribed conic U and the circumscribed conic V is as follows, viz. a tangent to U at a point of intersection with V meets V at a point of contact of a common tangent of U and V. In like manner for the quadrangle, if A be taken at a point of intersection, the sides AB and AD will coincide in direction with the tangent to U at this point, consequently B and D must coincide at the point where this tangent meets V; hence also CB, CD, the two tangents to UJ from the point C, must coincide, or C must be a point of intersection of the conics U, V. In other words, the pole, with respect to the inscribed conic U, of a common chord AC of the two conics must lie on the circumscribed conic V; this is therefore the condition for the quadrilateral. In the ordinary mode of drawing the figures, with two conics which do not intersect the points and lines employed in the foregoing constructions are imaginary, but the conics may be so drawn that these points and lines are all real. In general, for a polygon of an odd number, 2n+1, of sides, then starting from a point of intersection, the sides will coincide in pairs, viz. the first and last, second and last but one, and so on, the middle or (n+ 1)th side being a common tangent of the twco 238 MR. A. CAYLEY ON THE PORISM OF conics. But for a figure of an even number, 2n, of sides, then starting from a point of intersection of the two conics, the nth side will terminate at a second point of intersection, and then the same series of sides will be repeated in the reverse order, so that the sides will coincide in pairs, first and last, second and last but one, nth and (n+l)th. For a figure of an odd number of sides, the relation involves only a single point of intersection, but for a figure of an even number of sides, it involves two points of intersection. Now in the case of two circles, for a polygon of an odd number of sides, the same relation is obtained, whether we take as the point of intersection one of the actual points of intersection, or a circular point at infinity, and the relation [2n + 1] =0 does not break up into factors. And so for a polygon of an even number of sides, then taking for the two points of intersection, the two actual points of intersection, or the two circular points at infinity, we have one form of result; but taking for them an actual point of intersection and a circular point at infinity, we have a different form of result; and the equation [2n]=O does break up into factors. This is verified very simply in the case of the quadrangle. Taking for the two points of intersection the circular points at infinity, the line joining them is the line infinity, and its pole, with respect to the inscribed circle, is the centre of this circle; the relation therefore is that the centre of the inscribed circle lies on the circumscribed circle. But when this is the case it is easy to see that the pole (with respect to the inscribed circle) of the radical axis, lies also on the circumscribed circle; this pole and the centre of the inscribed circle are in fact the extremities of a diameter of the circumscribed circle. The condition thus obtained is 1R2-a2=O (which is M. MENTION'S condition i=0). We have next to find the analytical relation when the pole (with respect to the inscribed) circle, of the line joining one of the actual points of intersection with a circular point at infinity is a point on the circumscribed circle. This I effect as follows:-Taking z=O as the equation of line infinity, if the origin be taken on the middle point of the radical axis. and if x=0 be the radical axis, then the equations of the two circles may be taken to be Inscribed circle, a2 +y221 xz Vz2= 0. Circumscribed circle, x2+ y2 -2Lxz-Vz2=0. A circular point at infinity is x:y:z=1:i:0, (i=V/-1). An actual point of intersection is X:y: z=0 V:V: 1. The line joining these is Its pole, with respect to the inscribed circle, is :11:z= .i/V: VVil: 1.
