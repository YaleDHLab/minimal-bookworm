A farther Description and Representation of the Icy Mountain, called the Gletscher, in the Canton of Berne in Helvetia; which was formerly taken notice of in Numb. 49. of these Tracts. THis account was imparted to us from Paris by that worthy and obliging person, Monsieur Justel,who had received it from a trusty hand living upon the place,as follows; The Icy Mountain, of which I have sent you the Scheme*, deserves to be view'd. The letter A signifies the Mountain it self,which is very high, and extends it self every year more and more over the neighbouring meadows, by increments that make a great noise and cracking. There are great holes and caverns, which are made when the Ice bursts; which happens at all times, but especially in the Dog-days. Hunters do there hang up their game they take during the great heat, to make it keep sweet by that means. Very little of the surface melts in summer, and all freezeth again in the night. When the Sun shineth, there is seen such a variety of colors as in a Prism. B. is a rivolet, issuing forth from under the Ice, which is pretty deep and extreamly cold. C. are the Hutts, that were built at the beginning,at a considerable distance from the Mountain; but at present they are nigh to it by reason of the continual increase which this Ice maketh. There is such an other Mountain near Geneva and upon the Alps (6192) Alpes. A certain Capucin told me,he had been upon the high est of these mountains with a Trader in Crystal,who havin g driven his hammer into one of these Rocks, and found it ho llow and resonant, made a hole into it, and thence dre w forth a substance like Talk; which to him was a sign the re was Crystal. After which he made a great hole with Gu npowder,and found Rock-crystal in it. Tab 11 Trans No 100
