[646] XXIII. An Observation on the Planet Venus, (with regard to her having a Satellite) made by Mr. James Short, F. R. S. at Sunrise, October 23. 1740. DIrecting a reflecting Telescope of 16.5 Inches Focus, (with an Apparatus to follow the diurnal Motion) towards Venus, I perceived a small Star pretty nigh her; upon which I took another Telescope of the same focal Distance, which magnified about 50 or 60 times, and which was fitted with a Micrometer, in order to measure its Distance from Venus; and found its Distance to be about 10~. 2~. 0~. Finding Venus very distinct, and consequently the Air very clear, I put on a magnifying Power of 240 times, and, to my great Surprize, found this Star put on the same Phasis with Venus. I tried another magnifying Power of 140 times, and even then found the Star under the same Phasis. Its Diameter seemed about a Third, or somewhat less, of the Diameter of Venus; its Light was not so bright or vivid, but exceeding sharp and well defined. A Line, passing through the Centre of Venus and it, made an Angle with the Equator of about 18 or 20 Degrees. I saw it for the Space of an Hour several times that Morning; but the Light of the Sun increasing, I lost it altogether about a Quarter of an Hour after Eight. I have looked for it every clear Morning since, but never had the good Fortune to see it again. Cassini, ~ [647] Cassini, in his Astronomy, mentions much such another Observation. I likewise observed Two darkish Spots upon the Body of Venus; for the Air was exceeding clear and serene.
