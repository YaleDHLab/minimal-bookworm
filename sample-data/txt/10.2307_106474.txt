An experiment proposed for determining, by the aberration of the fixed stars, whether the rays of light, in pervading different media, change their velocity according to the laws which result from Sir Isaac Newton's ideas concerning the cause of refraction, and for ascertaining their velocity in every medium whose respective density is known, p. 58. See Leibnitz, Refraction. Proofs that the aberrations in a telescope filled with a dense fluid will precisely agree with that of Dr. Bradley's, only in the case of the rays moving swifter in the medium than in air, in the ratio assigned by Sir Isaac Newton, and that this sameness of aberration will itself be a proof of light being so accelerated within the telescope, p. 60. et seq.
