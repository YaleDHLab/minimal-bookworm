T R A N S A C T I O N S. . Ie An AGDOUBt of two Rainbows seen at the same Time at Alverstoke, Hants9 July 9, 179g. By tbe Rev. Mr. Sturges Communicated by Willialn Heberden, M. D. Fe R. S. Read January zo X 79S ON the evening of the gth of July, 179ej between seven and eight oaclock7 at Alverstoke, near Gosport, orl the sea coast of Hampshire, tllere came up, in the south-east, a cloud with a thunder-shower; while the sun shone bright, low in the hori zon to the north-west. In this shower two primary rainbows appeared, AS and A C, (Tab. I ) not concentric, but touching each other at A irl the south part of the horizon X with a secondary tow to eachs DE and DF (the last very faint, but discernible)7 which touched likewise, at D Both the primary were very vivid for a corlsiderable time,-and at diffierent times nearly equally soX but the bow AB was most permanentf was a larger segment of a circle, and at last, after the other had vanishedS became almost a sernicircle the sun being near MDCCXCIIXe BPHILOSOPHICAL Dr. STURGESgS ficcount of two Rainbozussetting. It was a perfect calmn and the sea was as smootl as glass. If-l might venture to offer a solution of this appearance) it would be as follows. I consider the bow A Bas the true one, produced by the sun itself; and the other AC, as produced by the reflection of the sun from the sea, which, in its perfectly smooth state, acted as a speculum. The direction of the sea between the Isle of Wight arld the land ras to the north-west in -a line with the sun, as it was then situated The image reflected from the water, having its rays issuing from a point lover than the real sunS and in a line coming from beneath the horizon, would consequently form a bow higher than the true one, AB. And the shores, by which that narrow part of tlle sea is bounded, svould, before the sunvs actual setting, intercept its rays from the surface of the waterX and cause the bow AC:> which l suppose to be produced by the reflectionf to disappear befire the other 0,X,y=,,,,.
