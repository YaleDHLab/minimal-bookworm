[59] VII. Problems concerning Interpolations. By Edward Waring, M. D. F. R. S. and of the Institute of Bononia, Lucasian Professor of Mathematics in the University of Cambridge. MR. BRIGGS was the first person, I believe, that invented a method of differences for interpolating logarithms at small intervals from each other: his principles were followed by REGINALD and MOVTON in France. Sir ISAAC NEWTON, from the same principles, discovered a general and elegant solution of the abovementioned problem: perhaps a still more elegant one on some accounts has been since discovered by Mess. NICHOLE and STIRLING. In the following theorems the same problem is resolved and rendered somewhat more general, without having any recourse to finding the successive differences. Read Jan. 9, 1779.

Assume an equation a + b x + c x2 + d x3.... xn-1 =y, in which the co-efficients a, b, c, d, e, &c. are invariable; I 2 let 60 Dr. WARING on Interpolations. let ~, ~, ~, ~, ~, &c. denote n values of the unknown quantity x, whose correspondent values of y let be represented by S~, S~, S~, S~, S~, &c. Then will the equation a + b x + c x2 + d x3 + e x4... xn-1 = y = x ~ x x ~ x x ~ x x ~ x &c./~ ~ x ~ ~ x ~ ~ x ~ ~ x &c. x S~ + x ~ x x ~ x x ~ x x ~ x &c./~ ~ x ~ ~ x ~ ~ x ~ ~ x &c. x S~ + x ~ x x ~ x x ~ x x ~ x &c./~ ~ x ~ ~ x ~ ~ x ~ ~ x &c. x S~ + x ~ x x ~ x x ~ x x ~ x &c./~ ~ x ~ ~ x ~ ~ x ~ ~ x &c. x S~ + x ~ x x ~ x x ~ x x ~ x &c./~ ~ x ~ ~ x ~ ~ x ~ ~ x &c. x S~ + &c.

In the same manner, by writing ~, ~, ~, ~, &c. successively for x in the given equation it may be proved, that when x is equal to ~, ~, ~, ~, &c. then will y become respectively S~, S~, S~, S~, which was to be demonstrated. 2.

This may be demonstrated in the same manner as the preceding theorem, by writing ~, ~, ~, ~, ~, &c. successively for x. P R O B L E M. Let there be n values ~, ~, ~, ~,~, &c. of the quantity x, to which the n values S~, S~, S~, S~, S~, &c. of the quantity y correspond; suppose these quantities to be found by any function X of the quantity x; let ~, ~, ~, ~, &c. be values of the quantities x, to which S~, S~, S~, S~, &c. values of the quantity y correspond: for x substitute its abovementioned values ~, ~, ~, ~, &c. in the function X, and let the quantities resulting be s~, s~, s~, s~, &c. not equal to the preceding S~, S~, S~, S~, &c. respectively; to find a quantity which added to the function X shall not only give the true values of the quantity y corresponding to the values ~, ~, ~, ~, ~, &c. of the quantity x, but also cor62 Dr. WARING on Interpolations. corresponding to the values ~, ~, ~, ~, &c. of the abovementioned quantity x. Assume s~ S~ = T~, s~ S~ = T~, s~ S~ = T~, s~ S~ = T~, &c.; then the errors of the function X will be respectively T~, T~, T~, T~, &c.; and the correcting quantity sought may be ~x ~ x ~x ~ x ~x ~ x ~x ~ x ~x ~ x &c./~~ ~ x ~~ ~ x ~~ ~ x ~~ ~ x ~~ ~ x &c. x ~x ~ x ~x ~ x ~x ~ x &c./~~ ~ x ~~ ~ x ~~ ~ x &c. x T~ + ~x ~ x ~x ~ x ~x ~ x ~x ~ x ~x ~ x &c./~~ ~ x ~~ ~ x ~~ ~ x ~~ ~ x ~~ ~ x &c. x ~x ~ x ~x ~ x ~x ~ x &c./~~ ~ x ~~ ~ x ~~ ~ x &c.

This Dr. WARING on Interpolations. 63 This problem may be demonstrated in the same manner as the preceding theorems, by writing for x in the correcting quantity successively its values ~, ~, ~, ~, &c. 2.

In general, let z be any quantity which is = 0, when x becomes either ~, ~, ~, ~, ~, &c.: let z become successively A, B, C, D, &c. when x becomes ~, ~, ~, ~, &c. respectively, When x either = ~, ~, ~, &c. let ~ = 0; but if x = ~, let ~ = p: in the same manner when x either = ~, ~, ~, &c. let P = 0; but when x = ~ let P = r: and similarly, let ~ = 0 when x is either ~, ~, ~, &c.; but when x = ~ let ~ = s: and likewise, when x is either ~, ~, ~, &c. let T = 0; but when x = ~ let T = t: &c. then for the correcting quantity sought may be assumed Z/A x ~/p x T~ + Z/B x P/r x T~ + Z/C x ~/s x T~ + Z/D x T/t x T~ + &c.

I have invented and demonstrated from different principles to the preceding the first part of this theorem, a particular case of which was published by me many years ago. From this theorem may easily be deduced several others of a similar nature. K 2
