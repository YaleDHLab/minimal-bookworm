(236) XXIV. A Letter from Mr. James Yonge, F. R. S. to Dr. Hans Sloane, R. S. Secr. containing the Case of a Woman who had her Menses regularly to 70 Years of Age. Plymouth, July 17. 1713. S I R, AT Lamerton, fifteen Miles from this Town, dy'd lately a Woman of Eighty six Years old; who to the Age of seventy had her Menses plentiful and regular. At that time they ceased, and soon after followed the like Eflux from the Haemorrhoids, which continued till she got on the wrong side of Fourscore. She was till then healthful and strong, of a vigorous Aspect, smooth, plump, and florid in Countenance, like one not half so Old: Her Appetite was very good; her Intellects clear and sound; and her sight so perfect, that she could to the last thread a Needle, and read small Print without Glasses. When that Flux ceased, she became Gouty; and about one Year before she dy'd, there arose an Apostumation on one of her Wrists, which open'd, and discharged much chalky Matter and some Stones. The Day she dy'd, she arose out of her Bed; and after performing some Christian Devotions, expired. She was never sick before the Hemorrhoidal Flux stopt, except once at Exeter, where she was born, and then lived, she became infected with what they called the Plague: It ended in a critical Abcess in one of the Emunctories; and which is very strange, during all the time of (237) of that Sickness, she nursed a Male Child, who is yet alive, and one of our Faculty; from whom I have this Relation. This History will afford occasion to divers Speculations, which I will not attempt to anticipate, but refer them to the Royal Society. I am, &c. J A M E S Y O N G E. XXV.
