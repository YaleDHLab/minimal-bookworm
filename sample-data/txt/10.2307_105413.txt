[694] LXVII. An Account of a stony Concretion taken from the Colon of an Horse; by Mr. H. Baker, F. R. S. I Have now the honour to lay before this Royal Society one half of a stony concretion, formed in the colon of an horse, which was lately sent me from Norwich, by my very curious friend Mr. William Anderon, F. R. S. This horse, he informs me, was twenty-five years old, had been often ill, and under the farrier's care; which made him desire to have it opened, when dead. Read May 8, 1760. The whole stone, when first taken out, weighed ten pounds and half; and he caused it to be sawed in two, that a better judgment might be made of the manner of its formation. Several smaller concretions were also found in the colon, some whereof are shewn herewith; but they are much less solid, and more irregular, than the large one. This ball is full seven inches in diameter, and consists of many laminae, or coats, which form a number of concentric circles, around a nucleus in the center, which seems to be a small shiver of black flint. Fifteen or sixteen of these coats are easily distinguishable, and some have been broken off: they vary something in colour, and are, in general, so stony, that they would probably take a pretty good polish. The coats differ in thickness, according, perhaps, to the time they were in forming: for it should seem, if conjecture may be allowed, that each coat was formed in a longer or shorter time, according to 2 its [695] its thickness; and that, between the finishing of one coat and the beginning of the next, there was some interval of time, and some suspension of that attractive power whereby, or of that component matter whereof, the several coats are respectively formed. H. Baker. Strand, May 8, 1760. LXVIII.
