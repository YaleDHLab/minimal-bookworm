PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS S Xi. An essay towards the calculus of fJnctions. Part II. By C. Babbage, Esq. Communicated by W. H. Wollaston, M. D. Sec. R. S. Read March 14, i 816G IN a former Paper which the Royal Society honoured with a place in the last Volume of their Transactions, I endeavoured to explain the nature of the calculus of functions, and I proposed means of solving a variety of functional equations containing only one variable quantity. My subsequent enquiries have produced several new methods of solving these, and much more complicated functional equations, and have convinced me of the importance of the calculus, particularly as an instrument of discovery in the more difficult branches of analysis; nor is it only in the recesses of this abstract science, that its advantages will be felt; it is peculiarly adapted to the discovery of those laws of action by which one particle of matter attracts or repels another of the same or of a different species; consequently, it may be applied to every branch of natural philosophy, where the object is to discover by calculation from the results of experiment,. the laws which MDCCCXVI. 1 b iSo MP. AABBAGES essay towards regulate the action of the ultimate particles of bodies To the accomplishment of these desirable purposes, it must be confessed that it is in its present state unequal ; but should the labours of future enquirers give to it that perfection, which other methods of investigation have attained, it is not too nuch to hope, that its maturer age shall unveil the hidden laws which govern the phenomena of magnetic, electric, or even of chemical action. WThen functional equations containing two or more variables occur, their solution presents still greater difficulties than those we have already considered; the new relations whic arise, necessarily require a new notation to distinguish them. I shall endeavour, as far as I am able, to apply or extend that already in use; but, as it is almost 'impossible in the infancy of a calculus to foresee the extent to which it may be carried, or the new views which it may be necessary to take of it, the notation I have used should only be considered as of a temporary nature ; it may be employed until some more convenient one be devised: perhaps, however, it miht be more advantageous that it should not be altered uintil our acquaintance with this subject becomes more intimate, and until the infinitely varied and comprehensive relations displayed in the doctrine of functions, have been more minutely examined. If A, be the characteristic of any function of two quantities x and y, that function is thus denoted 4, (x, y). Now, if instead of x in this quantity the original function be substituted, I shall call the result the second function, relative to x, and I shall denote it thus (, FAT R5 -} {F (Xr tA) YS Y the calculus offunctions. 8 1 The first index a refers to x, and the second index i refers to y. Similarly if instead of y in the original function, the function itself had been substituted, the result would have been the second function relative to y; it would be thus denoted 4, 2(Xpy) =4 (X,4' (Xy)) If there are more than two variables in the original function, they may be arranged in the order in which they are to be operated on, and the indices will denote the number of operations to be performed. Thus 4,2'3)I14 (X' y), Z v,) signifies that in the function 4'(x,y, z, v,) we must instead of x substitute the function itself, and in the result instead of y put the same function, this latter operation must be repeated, and finally, instead of v in the last result, put the original function; this last operation must again be repeated twice. There are m any cases which this notation does not conis prehend. If, for example, in the function just proposed, we wished again to take the function relative to x ory, it would not be easy to express thlis. . The method I propose is to have two ranks of indices, the lower one to distinguish the quantities operated on,; the upper one to mark the number of operations performed. According to this method the example just chosen would be written thus: 2z 3, Ix 4 1, 21 3i 4 (X,y, zv) If only such functions as these occur, we encumber our symbol without any advantage; if, however, we now wish to perform any farther operations, such, for instance, as to take the second function relative to z, and then the third relative to y, B b 182 Mr. BABBAGE'S essay towards we have a very convenient mode of doing it; these operations would be thus expressed; 2P 3, Jr 4, 2Y 3 I 9 21 3, 4, 3, 2 A' (x,y7znv) This notation may not appear sufficiently concise to those who do not consider the very complicated relation expressed by the above written symbol: it need, however, only be used in very few cases, and when the lower series of indices is omitted, it must always be understood, that the quantities themselves are arranged in the order in which they are to be operated on. If in a function of two variable (x,y,) we take the se. cond function relative to x, and then the second function rela: tive toy, we have 252 +i (xzy) = 4 x, 4' (xy 4'(XY If we take the second function first relative to y, and then the second relative to x we shall find 2, 2 2, J(sy)=+ {4(Xly)),4 (X(Iy),y)} It appears from this, that the order in which these operations are performed is not immaterial, as the order in which we differentiate a function of two variables is in the differential calculus. The two expressions just given are the two second functions of 4 (x_,y), the first taken relative to x and y, and the second taken relative toy and x. But there may be another second function of 4' (x, y), which will arise from substituting at the same time 4 (x,y) for x, and 4' (xy) fory, it will. be 4'( (x,y), 4 (Xy)) the calculus oj'junctions. 83 and may for the sake of distinction be called the second simultaneous function relative to x and y ;i it differs from the two preceding ones, and in order to denote it with brevity, I shall put a line over the two indices thus, A, (xay) _ A (P (xy), 4 (xly)) This method of distinguishing it is equally applicable when there are more variables. There is only one other modification of the symbol denoting function to which I shall at present allude. Suppose (after any number of operations have been performed on a function of two variables for example) y becomes equal to x, and the result only is given: this will naturally be represented in a manner analogous to that in which EULER denoted the limits between-,which the integral of a quantity is to be taken. 2, 2 Thus the equation 4," Z(x,y) =fx fy x] arises from the following question: What is the form of a function of x and y, such that taking the second function relative to x, and then the second relative to y, the result on making y equal to x shall be a given function of x ? It might be proposed, that after putting y equal to x, the whole should be considered merely as a function of x, and that its ntb function should be taken on this hypothesis, and the result only should be given. Such operations I would denote thus: 2,12 tn o 21 2 5 ? 1)} 2! 1 22 .4/2 (Xy) =f (x) fy=xj or perhaps 1 1 (xy) =f(x)[y x] and in a similar manner all other relations of the same kind ciay be expressed.

What must be the form of a function of four quantities vi (xny, z, v) such that taking the second function relative to z, the third relative to x, and the second simultaneous one relative to y and v: if in the result ax be put for y and 13z for v, and thewhole be then considered as a function of x and z, and if on this hypothesis the third function be taken relative to z, and the second relative to x; and if yx be now put for z and the third function of the expression considered merely as a function of x be taken, then it is required that the final result shall be equal tojx a given function of x? Symnmnetrical functions I shall denote as in myformer Paper, by putting a line over the quantities relative to which they are symmetrical, thus 4 (x, y, z, v) is symmetrical relative to x and y in one sense, and relative to z and v in another.

Given the same equation 4,(Xy)= ( acx, 3Wy) Suppose one particular solution of this equation is known, let it bej(xy), then take 4, (x, y) _ f (x, y), p being perfectly arbitrary and the given equation becomes 9f(xSy) = f (ax, y) which is evidently satisfied sincef (xy) =f (cx, jy) by the hypothesis.

PROBLEM IlLe Given the equation , (xy)I= A 4( (xy),A(x,y)) Assume t (x,y) =p(f (xy),f(x,y)), and by making this substitution the equation becomes e f (XA7')vx7 fJ(a(x~y),~(xyy)),.(2 (Xv)Y)3(xS3)) In order to render this equation identical, I determinef andf from the two following equations: (x~y)=1(I' y),R(xmy)) andf(xy)=f(a(x~y),~(xy)) From these it appears, thatf andf are merely two particular It solutions of the original equation, If, therefore, we are acquainted with any, the general solution is 4 (xgy) = U (f(xIy),f(,y)) If only one particular solution is known, the general one is 4 (XIy) = Zf(Xy) Ex. i. Let us examine in what cases we can find the general solution of the equation 4 (Xy) 4, (Xn y",, xkyr) In order to obtain a particular solution, put 4 (xy)-xvyw and making this substitution, we shall find the following equation of condition among the exponents.

The equation (b) Nvill coincide with the one under consideration, if we make n__ and r= I , then we shall have for another particular solution f (x, y ) =vy/yI hence a v ery general solution of the equation (X)Y) 4,(xY y= X~y,#: (X (ZY) = 22w 2 2Z is A(XjY)= pStXY+Y Y*,2.T} 9 remaining perfectly arbitrary. In thee equation of this Problem it may happen that tie calculus offunclons 189 c (xy) does not contain x nor A (x, y) contain y, it then becomes 4,(xy)=4,(;y, x) This is the case when 4 (xy) is required to be a symmetrical function of x andy, the equation would then become two particular solutions are f (x,y) = xy andf (xjy) x +y, hence the general solution of the equation is ,(x~Y))-=p (xy, X +y) Though the-se solutions may with propriety be termed general because they contain an arbitrary function, yet I am by no means inclined to think them the most general of which the questions admit, possibly we ought to except the two last equations, though I shall afterwards show that the solution of an equation of the form 4 Sxy) = (aIx, Py) may contain any number of known functions within the arbitrary one. PROBLEM IV. Given the equation X, Y) + (XJ Y), (X Y)) Assume as before 4, (xy) (ffx,y),f(x,y)), then the equation will become P (f(x.y)Jf (,xy))= { f (Mx)y)) A (xy))f(a (x)y), (xyj } In order to render this equation identical, determinef andf from the two equations , (X y ), =f (a (Xs y) G (x>y)) an d,,(x y ) 3f ( 06 (x,y),j (X,y)) putting in the first of these a (xy) for x and A ( y) fory ~~~~~C C we findu I~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 0go Mr. BABBAGE'S essay towards and we should find a precisely similar equation for determnin ingf. If we are acquainted with two particular solutions of this equation, we may from them derive the general solution of the given equation. If, however, the functions U and 3 are of such a nature that the two following equations are fulfilled eq. (1) becomes identical without assigning any particular value to] orf. (The two conditions are a (cY (XI y) 3 (xy)) = x ? and /3( (x,y), (xy) ) y). It may be curious to enquire whether we can discover any forms which will satisfy these equations, for this purpose let us assume c(x y) -a+bx+cy, and also f (xy)=a =a bx+cy, , ~ ~ ~~~~~~~I X this will only lead us to a particular solution, but I shall presently show that it may be rendered general. If the two conditions already specified are fulfilled, the arbitrary constants -will be ,determnined, and we shall have the following equations ce(x,y)=a bx + b Y ab~~~ which may be thus generalised. Let e be any function, and let q be the inverse of that function, so that 4xB x xthen the conditions will be fulfilled, if (any)Ad a Jr bogx+ b AS} and a b;r by anal 6 (x)Y) I_ ib-ET by Some remarks, however, are necessary on the inverse func. tion p . If we combine x and constant quantities by any of the direct operations, addition, multiplication, elevation of powers, &c. the result which is called a function of x admits the-calculus offunctions. 191 only of one value, let z equal the function, then we have the equation z= At. If fro'm this we endeavour to discover the value of x in terms of z, the operation is an inverse one and x admits of one or more values according to the nature of the operations denoted by ho This number may even be infinite; if m denotes an equation of the no degree there are n values of x in terns of z. It may then be enquired whether in using the substitution ent ployed in the latter part of this Problem,any of these (perhaps infinite number) may be taken, or whether only certain particular values should be used.? without attend, ing to this circumstance, our conclusions may become erroneous: all these different values will satisfy the equation p 1x ,but only those must be used which also satisfy the equation Ad Xerox: thus if z= x -a -x we shall have x= zen Vaz if we employ the upper sign we have VPz-+ Va-( -x ).+.x.=+ If we use the lower one 0 At=-1/ a -(a xt)_w/xthe upper sign must therefore be taken, because in the latter part of the Problem we suppose q = x and (y _=y. This remark, which is of some importance, extends to tlhe conclusions in mny former Paper and to the whole of the subsequent enquiries. The equation (1) might be considered as similar to thie original one, and the same transformation might be performed on this, and thus we might continue to deduce new conditions. In the first part we found that the equation Ax -= ax always admitted of an easy solution when cdX = x and by continuing the substitutions already pointed out, we should arrive at 19-2 ?Mr. BABBAOE's essay towards some conclusions very analogo is for functional equations of the form of those treated of in this Problem, but the length to which these enquiries would lead, render it sufficient merely to indicate them. In the equations solved in Problem I. and II. it is obviously immaterial whether we first put ax instead of x, and then in the result put 12y for y or conversely; but in the equation of Problems III. and IV. the case is diff rent. If in the function 4.i(x,y) we put simultaneously a (x,y) for x, and n (xy) for y the result will be different from that which would arise from first pu-tting ca (xy) for x and then in the result putting P (x, y) for y, or from inverting this operation; the three results stand thus 4( (x)y), f(x~y)) (a) (X1 (X? ('Xn7))) k (X) Y)) (b) iThcs three functions are evidontly diferent, and in the solu. tions of the Problems, regard was only had to the first of them whic h may be called the simultaneous fuiction. Those, however, of the second and third class might occur, and it becomes necessary to point out the means of. solution which areapphlcable to thewm A ccording to the notation laid down, these functions may oe thus expressed 4/'( (xy), n (xy)) (a) I, I B(u (Xty)o i (XInd ) (I) But to avoid the troulble of inldices I s-lall, shlow bow those of ihe calcduls ofufznctions. 19S the second and third class may be reduced to those of the first, I shall therefore always consider functions of the first order as simultaneous ones, and omit the. indices, which if supplied, would be ' k I &c. 3 I, I To transform ' (a x, y), (xy)) into a function whose Index i's ' put a (x, (x, y) 7 (x, y) then 1,1 2~ +1,2@( (Xy), _)(Xy))= > (Xy)$ :Sy)) and similarly iff3 ( (xy), 1 (x, ) =y (x,y) we should have x I A~ ((X y), n (X y)b>( y. wY) ) and generally whatever be the number of variables a simnilar transformation might be efficted. PROBLEM V. Required the solution of the equation.

Ex. Let xy)(-j4(yx) in this casef (x,y) (y, x) and two particular solutions are f(xy) = xy and f(xyy) -v y also a particular solutionv of the given equation isf (x,y) x hence its general soluy tion is 4'(x2Y) = (X+Yx Y) PROBLEM VI. Given the equation (xy)=A( xy) 4 (c(xy),f ( vy)) + B (x'y) Suppose we are ac uainted with one particular solutiu n which satisfies the equation and let it bef (Q,y), then assume 4 (xiy) (xy) + q (xy) and making this substitution the equation becomes f (Xgy) + p (X y) = A (xjy)f (a (xy), A (xy)) +A (xy) x p (a (xy), P (xy)) + B (xy) Substracting from this the particular solution f(xny) =A( ,y)f(x(xZy),P(xy)) + B(xzy) there remains ap (x~y) --A (x~y) tp (as (x~y), xA (x,y)) an equation which may be solved by the preceding Problem. The same substitution is applicable to the more general equafion o-= (xy)+A (xy) t (c-(xy),: (xy)) B (xy) 4(c(xy),/(x,y))+ &c. + K (xy) the calculus offiunctions. 19 PROBLEM VII. Given the functions a (XY), a (XY), & (,)Y) & C I (X (Al), (X;Y)y: (XlY) &C. Required the nature of the function 4' (r,y) such that it shall not alter its form by the simultaneous substitution of (x,y), 13 (xry) for x andy, and generally that it shall remain the same when for and y are respectively substituted, any of the functions denoted by a (er, y) and 13 (, y). The n conditions which determine 4. may be thus expressed A ({v,y) fcy ( } (=,Y) ( {f( (y) 13 (xy),fn (xy),QY)) } & Assume =f ( 3xy) 3 y (anY ) =f(XyY) ( ) (xly) then froln the first condition we havie A Jx:I,Y)Jf(X,y) = q5 ;t(M(X;YJ(.1C,Y)),f (x (X,Y),:(SY))} this will be satisfied by making f( xjy) =f( ot VIY)) S (x y) ) and f (xtny) =f (aM (xn y), 2 (Sx y) ) these are two particular solultions of the first equatioml The second condition is 4 (-x,y) = ( (xy), 1 (x,y)) which becomes q (fV, Y),f(xY)) = (f(z (xZy)),1(xY)), f( (xy), (xY)) (2) wheref andf are known functions ; make f^(a (,y), 1 (,y)) K (x,y) andf(z (x, y), 13 (, y)) K (xy) K and 'K are therefore also known functions.

The relation between A (x, y) = px + qy and 2,n (x, y) =(p + q)n-I (pX +qy) is very remarkable, it appears fromt this, that in the present case in going from the nth to the it + 1tb simultaneous function, we have only to multiply by the sum of the co-efficients of the original functi on. On enquiring a little more minutely into the cause of this circumstance, it will be found that it depends on the original function containing x and y of the same dimensions in all its terms, or more generally that the expression of + (x, y) is homogeneous.

With regard to the equation of the Problem Alez (x,y) 4, z(xjy), I have little expectation of finding any particular case, as I think the following reasoning, though perhaps not quite so satisfactory as might be wished, will show the impossibility of it. First, let us suppose, that 4 (x,y) is a symnme. trical function of x and y, let it be X (xI y) then our equation becomes X{X(X.y),yAfX X)% (X )}X{X(XY)gX} Comparing the first of these expressions with the third, we may observe that in the first, wherever xs (x, jZ occurs the same quantity x (x, 3) also occurs in the third, consequently in this respect, the first and third are identical: but wherever y occurs in the first, x occurs similarly in the third, therefore in this respect they cannot be identical, unless y is equal to x. From this it appears, that the equation in question cannot be solved by any symmetrical function. Again, the given equation t' (X, Y) 4 1, 2( X, y) contains x and y in the same manner, and no reason can be assigned why in the solution x should be contained differently from y: this may, perhaps, be made more clear, thus. Letf (x, y) be the quantity to which each side of the given equation is equal, then N se 1 (X y) (=f(Xy) a als 2(x , y) No;w since (, (Xy), y) f(x.,y) and also A~ (XX + (x, y))= the calculus of functions. 2X9 f (x,.y); and since taking the second functions is a direct operation, it is evident that the original function 4 (x, y) will produce the same result, whether we take the second function relative to x or relative to y; therefore it must be Similarly composed of x and y; that is to say, it must be symmetrical relative to x and y : but we have before shown that no symmetrical function can satisfy the equation, consequently the equation is contradictory. This train of reasoning I offer with considerable hesitation, well aware of the extreme difficulty of reasoning correctly on a subject so very general, and which, from its novelty, the mind has not been sufficiently habituated to consider, so as to rely with confidence on any lengthened process of reasoning. I thought it, however, right to mention this proof, that those who may seek for particular cases, might first enquire whether the equation be possible. PROBLEM XXI. Given the equation X b .s.

One important use of this transformation is the solution of equations of the form F { I yj (X y)I ha) 2(Z XI )5 IX, ZXy) ) &C. } 0 in which the functions are taken only relative toy, and yet x is not altogether constant. It may be transformed into F X y A (xky)m 2 (xy) tI, 3 (a y) &c. 0 which may be treated as an equation of one variable, v being constant. This is the species of equation alluded to at page (198) After considering the various equations amongst the higher orders of functions, another question presents itself, which maybe thus stated. What must be the form of a function of (n) variables, such that taking the functions relative to any or to all of them any number of times, and co nbining these quantities in! any manni er, the result shall (when all these variables are miade equal to x) be equal to a given function of x? This question might thus be expressed when there are only two variables x, y, y >(xy), E ,:z(tXy)XtZ (x,y), &c. f(a) 0ya this condition obviously enlarges the signification of the funcction A, and the solutions ought to be more general. We shall accordingly find that some equations, of which without this condition we cannot find even a particular solution are capas ble, when it is added, of very extensive ones. When there are more than two variables, the condition may be, that making the calcu4us offunctions. 225 them equal by pairs, the result shall be given: a particular case would be the equation Fxy z,v,zw,r,4(x,y,z,v,w.,r,&c.} =F{xv,r} [E-] Instead of making y equal to XI and z to v and so on, y might become a given function of x, and z a given function of pv &c. thus: Fxyzvwr, 4(x,y,z, v,w,r,),&c. } F x~v,r, } ] a few examples will sufficiently explain the method to be pursued in treating these equations. PROBLEM XXVIII. Given the equation 2) I (X y 1, +J 2, (X y) E This Problem, of which without the condition of y being made equal to x w e could not find even a particular case, readily admits of solution in its preseit state. Since At '( ,y) is only equal to (xy), when y = x we may put for the given eqlation Ado I(y) { @)Y) (XI bY).(l provided that when y is equal to xI the latter side of the equation shall become A (xy), and this fully satisfies the condition of the Problem. If, therefore, we can find such a value of A, the equation (i) may be treated as a common functional equation of two variables, and may be solved by the rules already given. Nor is it at all difficult to find such a value of ; if we make At (O Y, y ,zj o must be such a function that q?

Now let v = m (my, z), it becomes P {9K(X-y, z) cP(xny, Z), z} =z but this expression is nothing more than the second simultaneous function relative to x and y, and may be therefore more concisely expressed thus 2 I(ah Y, Z) = z in which equation, since it does not vary relative to z, that quantity may be considered as a constant; and the equation P 22(2Sy) = z constant being solved, we have only to substitute instead of the various constant quantities arbitrary functions of z: thus then the solution of the equation q(x'YyZ)= CY= x is reduced to that of 21 2 (, y)=constant and we have only to refer to Problem (ilo) for its general solution. Let us apply this to the solution of the equation of this Problem 4o1 (xy ) .4Is 2&,y) Cy =x the calcubus offunctions. 227 take as a particular case of the equation 2X (xy, Z) z p(x,y, z) -X Z, then the equation of the Problem becomes Ip,2 (x, y) __XA,2 (xmy) or A E2J (X A) = XAs Z(X )Y y this is the equation solved in Prob. XXI. therefore all its solutions are also solutions of this equation. This however is, comparatively speaking, but a very limited answer: every different solution of the equation ,p2y z 1 (x, y, z) = z furnishes a new solution of our Problem, containing one or more arbitrary functions; each of these may very justly be called a general solution; but to investigate the number and nature of the arbitrary constants which enter into the complete solution, is an enquiry of considerable difficulty. PROBLEM XXIX.

Given the equation F 2, I)2 (ad y), 4 1, 2)3 ( Ay) Ay } Cy =0 The difficulties in this case appear to be much encreased from this circumstance, that the second function of 2, I (x, x) relative to x is quite different from the second function of BI) 2'(x, x) relative to the same quantity. The method of solution which I shall explain is equally applicable to all of this species, and consists in reducing them to a class which has been already solved. It may be observed, that whether we take the second function of 4,t I (x, x) relative to x, or whether we take the simultaneous function of 42,' (x,y) considered as a simple function, and in the result put x for y, the two expressions will be the sanme; the first gives and the second is which when y becomes equal to x is identical with the former; but 4,z'X (+2X I'Qry),4," I (x y))=4,"' { 4,A(a (x y ),y ) 4,(4, (xS y),y) } 2~ Ix Ix I, I 4'y(xy) I(XI X I the lower line of indices denoting the quantities relative to which the operations are performed.

VII. Part I all functional equations of the first order may be reduc ed to this form; and although in many cases this reduction is very difficult, or even in the present state of analysis out of our power, yet it is theoretically possible, and we shall therefore consider all equations as so reduced. There is this remarkable difference between the former mnethods and the present one; Those which I have already given always led to the general solution, and perhaps, in some cases, to the complete one ; these, on the contrary, which I shall now propose, always conduct us directly to a particular solution, which does not contain even an arbitrary constant. It has, however, several advantages; it is the most direct method with which we are yet acquainted; and if by any means we could introduce into these solutions an arbitrary constant, it would afford us general ones: this is a step which is wanting to connect it with the former methods. In the case of differential functional H h 230 tMr. BABBAGE's ess4y towards equations, this step is supplied by the integrations which are necessary, and we thus arrive at their general solutions.

An other exception is, when the equation F { x,, x, 4at, &C. 1 ex } O is homogeneous relative to the different forms of the unknown function; for in this case when we attempt to eliminate them, they all disappear together, leaving an equation of condition;, thus given tZ = (a -) A oc and Ob2xg t we have 4ax -(a t ax) a 2 (a ax) ,x and 4x = (a,-,) (a.-ax) Aso ior = _(a-cx) (a-d?x) which equation is not necessarily true. 2934 Mr. BABBAGE'S essay towards Another exception is, when the given equation can be made to assume the formn F {.4 geX .u % V.fx In this case the equation cannot be fulfilled unless f' is a symmetrical function of x, ax, &c. ox, because the first side is such a symmetrical function: this reason, however, should be received with caution, for if the operation denoted by be an inverse one, it may admit of several values, and it seems possible, that in such a case the condition relative to the form off need not be fulfilled.

If after satisfying the conditions of the Problem, there remain any arbitrary constants, we may suppose them functions of x, and new equations will thence arise by which they may be determined. It might occur (when there are several arbitrary quantities) that, by assigning particular values to some of them, the others might remain in a certain degree arbitrary, should this be the case, we should obtain general solutions.

I shall therefore refrain from giving any more examples, and proceed to show how functional equations involving definite integrals may be reduced to those we have already treated. Such equations might occur in a variety of curious and interesting enquiries,, few of which have yet been noticed. D'ALEMBERT, in one of the volumes of his Opuscules, has examined a question which may be referred to tfs class; it is the following. Suppse a sphere composed of particles of matter, what mustbe the law of attraction amongst these particles, so that the force of the whole sphere acting on a particle at a distance, may follow the same law? the question might be varied by supposing the law to be given, and the form of the solid to be required;, 242 ;Mr. BABBAGE's essay towards but the general solution of such questions is by no means easy. PROBLEM XXXVII Required the nature of the function 4A such that Jdx 4 Qx 4' ta the integral being taken between the limits x-o and x-a. Assume 0 (x, v) suchi that (x, v) P (o, v) c V the form of 9 may be ascertained from this equation by means already described. Then if' we make f1dxt Tv=c (x, ha) (i) it is evident that between the two limits x o and x = a, the integral wili be reduced to 4a, and we have therefore a differential functional equation whose mode of solution has already been pointed out. Other more complicated equations may be solved in the same way; these I shall omit. I shall, however, make some observations on this method of solution, with a view to point out some questions of considerable importance. In equation (1) the function indicated by e is so assumed that we may have -t(a, Spa) (o,,Ha) Pa from which, perhaps, it might be imagined, that p (x, -4a) must contain only x, 4a and constant quantities, but the condition would still be fulfilled if it contained 4ia, 4'a, or bna, which though not actually variable cannot strictly be regarded as constant. To fix our ideas, let us consider the example in tlhis Problem; one value of cp (x, 4a) is evidently p (x, 4a) H 'a, vwe have therefore jdxz Jx an 4a the calculus offnctions. and by differentiating n-i 'Lx from which 4x may be found.

Aa,. -mna} the value of a thus deduced, will furnish the values of a., &c. Ana, and these being substituted in a, will give the value of x this solution is evidently of a different nature from the former, and forms another species. Again, the following form of w will also agree with the conditions c (x,/a) A4a+xP(x-a)f 'a,. a, a, x, ax, xx,...+tx which being substituted in the Problem mx nust be found from a functional equation of the kpb order; must then be put equal to a, and the new functional equation of the no order relative to a must be solved; this is a third species of solution different from either of the former. Respecting these three species of -solutions, a very important question MDCCCXVIO K k 244 M r.BABBAGE'S essay toward may be proposed. What degree of generality does each posh sess, and how many and what sort of arbitrary functions does each solution involve? To discuss this question, and -to point out the nature of other solutions yet more general, which may be found for these and other similar Problems would far exceed the limits of a mere outline of the calculus. I shall conclude my remarks on this Problem by stating the -plan to be pursued in one particular case, which may serve as a model for all similar operations.

Let its solution be {a-F a, o,Wo} (s) Now substitute o for a retaining o as a letter instead of making it actually zero, there will result a new functional equation of the second order, whose solution is 4o=FF o} and lastly, substituting this value of {o, and also that of t;o which may be deduced fromn it in (2) we have the value, of fa, front this Ada may be found, and these being substituted in (i) give the value of {x. the calculus offunctions. 245 PROBLEM XXXVIII.

Amongst the numerous questions to which the calculus of functions is applicable, I shall select a problem proposed by EULER in one of the volumes of the Acta Acad. Petrop. as it will offer an example of a mode of treating of functional equal tions of a nature, yet more general than those contained in this paper, the calculus offunctions. PROBLEM XLII. Required the nature of a curve such that taking any ordinate DB, and drawing a normal at the point D, the next ordinate CE raised at the foot of the normal shall be equal to that normal. Let AB x, BD y and y 4x be the equation of the curve, then BC = Ydy dx and DC + y dy an bythe condition of the Problem we have 027 + (ydy ) ( ydy hence +xd4a f fixd x E 2g F dl | rY + dx (a) dxi dx I This is apparently a very difficult functional equation, and I am iiot acquainted with any direct mnetbod of solving other similar ones. It is in fact only from a peculiar condition which this equation involves that any solutions have been obtained, the condition to which I allude is, that the quantity -'--does -,X d.4,x not change, when for x we substitute x + +-wor expressed in symbols, that L 1 Mr.BAB BAGEs essay towrds d +xd+ 4 xd 4 't'e dx dx _ d<x + x dAx dx c XZ F dx which may be thus proved differentiate (a) wh'ich give.

It ought, however, to be observed, Me calculus offunctions. that the constant quantity introduced by integration, is not perfectly arbitrary, it must be determitned so as to make the equation between x andy fulfil the equation (a). If for instances we assuln" (-p) to be equal to a id-Y, we should find the equation of the curve to be) Ye= (a + x) c c being the constant iat oduced by integration, and on Sull stituting this value ofy in (a) we shall find c = o} so that my-,( + x) 0 Let us suppose a to be infinite and equal to!, then we have C y (L +x) c b = b + .. x b, since c o which is the equation of a straight line parallel to the axis of the x's, which in fact agrees with the conditions of the Problem. If we suppose cp (Y) = at a constant quantity, we should find x -cV yt-a' this value being substituted in (a) gives for determining c the equation c (ct+ i) . 0 whence c=o and c'+ V-1, using this latter value we have V = vit X 52= 2-y which is the equation of the circle, and it is obvious, that t fis curve satisfies the conditions. It is very necessary to attend to this mode of determining the constants, as wve should otherwise meet in the solution with many curves which do not satisfy the conditions; thus in the last example, the curve is apparently an hyperbola, but owing to the constant becoming imaginary, it is 'in fact a circle. 256 Mr. BABB.AGE'S essay, &c. To complete the outline of this new method of calculation, it Would be necessary to treat of equations involving two or more functional characteristics, and to explain methods of eliminating all but one of them: these lead to a variety of interesting and difficult enquiries, and will probably be of considerable use in completing the solutions of partial differential equations: it would also be proper to consider the maxima and minima of functions, and to apply to this subject the method of variations these are points of considerable difficulty, and although I have made some little progress in each of them, Is shall forbear for the present any farther discussion on this subject. In the mean time, the sketch which I have offered, and the few applications I have given, are sufficient to point out the great importance of this method. It should however be observed, that its applications have only been noticed incidentally; my object has been to direct the attention of the analyst to a new branch of the science, and to point out the manner of treating it,: the doctrine of functions is of so ge neral a nature, that it is applicable to every part of mathematical enquiry, and seems eminently qualified to reduce into one regular and uniform system the diversified methods and scattered artifices of the modern analysis; from its comprehensive nature, it is fitted for the systematic arrangement of the science, and from the new and singular relations which it expresses, it is admirably adapted for farther improvements and discoveries' Moreover, since the derived functions are in the limiting ratio of the 'increments, so also are the fluxions. From this consideration we can in the applications of analysis, practically determine the ratio of the fluxions, when the derived functions are unknowno
