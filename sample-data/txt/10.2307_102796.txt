(756) V. An Abstract of two Letters written by Dr Francis Monginot, to Dr Peter Silvestre, F. R. S. giving an Account of an unusual Medicinal Case. I Was surpriz'd yesterday with a very extraordinary Case, and I am sure you will find it such as deserves most particular consideration. Madam R -'s Girl fell into violent Convulsion fits; and while she was in them voided a large quantity of Blood by the Mouth, the Nose, the Ears, and the Eyes. The Mother shew'd me some bloody Tears she had gather'd. All these Symptoms were over in half an hours time, and the young Girl, that some days before had been taken with a violent Head-ach, attended with a Fever, and a mighty oppression, was very well presently after that Haemorragia. The same accidents, as I hear, have happened several times. I am apt to believe they are Epileptick Fits; but the sudden relief and cessation of them by bleeding through all these parts, I must confess is wonderful to me. I wish you, and the rest of our Friends of the Profession would think of it. Dublin, Novemb. 4. 1700. According to your desire, I send you a more exact account of the Case, I mention'd to you in my last. All the following particulars I had from the Mother. Madam R-'s Daughter was between two and three years old, when on a sudden she complain'd of a very violent Head-ach: She was also observ'd to be seaverish, and extremely restless. At the same time her Eye-lids did (757) did very much swell, and they were so heavy, that one could hardly open her Eyes but with a great dea of pain. These symptoms did continue for three or four months, tho sometimes more or less violent. At last, she fell into Convulsive motions of her Arms, Legs, and other parts, and these were very fierce for two days, till she began to bleed by the Nose, the Mouth, the Ears and the Eyes. The Linnen Cloaths, that were then applied to the Eye-lids, were all wet and bloody. This Haemorragia lasted above a day; and what is more remarkable, When it was expected that the Child should be extremely weakned, she found herself so well freed from her illness, that she came to her gaiety again, and ask'd for some Victuals. Within twelve months after she had four of these Attacks, but not so great: in particular, the Convulsion fits were very inconsiderable, in comparison of the first. The same Symptoms did not return again above two or three times every year, and the Head ach did not continue above eight days before the Bleeding: and even then it was much more supportable. About two months ago I was sent for to see the Girl, who is now seven years old. I found her in Bed, complaining extremely of a Head-ach, attended with a Feaver, a great Catharr, and such a shortness of breath, as if she had had a Peripneumonia. She had been three days in that condition. I told the Mother, my opinion was she should be blooded presently; to which she readily consented, telling me withal, that she did not doubt but these were the fore-runners of the same Hemorrage the Girl had before. This made me the more insist upon the opening of a Vein; but it being very late, it was put off till next morning, and then indeed it was needless; for very early in the morning, after someConvulsion fits,she began to bleed from the Nose, the Mouth, &c. I was very sorry they did not send for me, to be an Eye-witness of this unusual Evacuation; for when I came it was almost (758) most over. I could only see a little bleeding from the Mouth; but all the people in the house told me they had seen the Blood drop from all these parts. The Girl was then pretty well, without any Feaver or Catharr: She could breathe freely, was in good humour, and had a good Stomach; and ever since has continued in perfect health. Now, seeing the returns are not so frequent, and the Symptoms are so notably diminish'd, I am in hopes this may soon have an end: or at least 'tis very probable to me, that these accidents will totally cease, whenever she comes to have her Catamenia.
