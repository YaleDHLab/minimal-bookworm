i 559 1 XXIV.-On the development of the disturbing Function, upon which depend the inequalities of the motions of the Planets, caused by their mutual attraction. BY JAMES IVORY, K.H., M.A., F.R.S., Instit. Reg. Sc. Paris. Corresp. et Reg. Sca Gottin. Corresp. Received May 30,-Read June 20, 1833. THE perturbations of the planets caused by their mutual attraction depend chiefly upon one algebraic expression, from the development of which all the inequalities of their motions are derived. This function is very complicated, and requires much labour and many tedious operations to expand it in a series of parts which can be separately computed according to the occasions of the astronomer. The progress of physical astronomy has undoubtedly been retarded by the excessive length and irksomeness attending the arithmetical calculation of the inequalities. On this subject astronomers generally and continually complain; and that their complaints are well founded, is very aptly illustrated by a paper contained in the last year's Transactions of this Society. The disturbing function is usually expanded in parts arranged according to the powers and products of the excentricities and the inclinations of the orbits to the ecliptic; and, as these elements are always small, the resulting series decreases in every case with great rapidity. No difficulty would therefore be found in this research, if an inequality depended solely on the quantity of the coefficient of its argument in the expanded function; because the terms of the series decrease so fast, that all of them, except those of the first order, or, at most, those of the first and second orders, might be safely neglected, as producing no sensible variation in the planet's motion. But the magnitude of an inequality depends upon the length of its period, as well as upon the coefficient of its argument. When the former embraces a course of many years, the latter, although almost evanescent in the differential equation, acquires a great multiplier in the process of integration, and thus comes to have a sensible effect on the place of the planet. Such is the origin of some of the most remarkable 4 c 2 560 MR. IVORY ON THE DEVELOPMENT of the planetary irregularities, and in particular, of the great equations in the mean motions of Jupiter and Saturn, the discovery of which does so much honour to the sagacity of LAPLACE. It is not, therefore, enough to calculate the terms of the first order., or of the first and second orders, in the expansion of the disturbing function. This is already done in most of the books that treat of physical astronomy with all the care and fulness which the importance of the subject demands, leaving little room for further improvement. In the present state of the theory of the planetary motions, it is requisite that the astronomer have it in his power to compute any term in the expansion of the disturbing function below the sixth order; since it has been found that there are inequalities depending upon terms of the fifth order, which have a sensible effect on the motions of some of the planets. A research that has for its object the lessening of the difficulty attending the expansion of the disturbing function, and the bringing of that expression more under the power of the astronomer, is one of considerable interest, and of some moment to the progress of physical astronomy. But the question is not to exhibit separately every individual argument with its coefficient, which would he of little utility in practice, since, although their number be infinite, very few of them are of any account in computing the place of a planet. The end to be aimed at, is to give the function such a form that the astronomer may have it in his power to select any inequality he may wish to examine, and to compute the coefficient of its argument by an arithmetical process of moderate length. The present Paper is an attempt of this kind. The investigation comprehends every argument not passing the fifth order; but, as the formulas are regular, the method may be extended indefinitely to any order. 1. Let x, y, ze, represent the rectangular coordinates of the disturbed planet, z being perpendicular to a fixed plane passing through the sun's centre, at which point the origin of the coordinates is placed: in like manner let x', y', z' be the coordinates of the disturbing planet; and put m' for the proportion of the mass of this planet to the sum of the masses of the sun and the disturbed planet then, R denoting the disturbing function, we shall have, _ I / (i_)2 + (y -,y)2 + (Z'-Z)2 (a! + y + z'2)* If r and r denote the distances of the disturbed and disturbing planets from OF THE DISTURBING FUNCTION. 561 the sun's centre; w, their angular distance seen at the same point; and I, their rectilinear distance fi'om one another then, f =Vr2 -2rr'coscZ + r'2 R 1 rcos w It appears, therefore, that the function to be expanded consists of two parts, 1 of which b , the reciprocal of the distance of the two planets, is common to the disturbing functions of both; but this is not the case with the other part, in which r and r' do not enter alike. For this reason it will contribute to distinctness to expand the two parts separately. But, previously, it is necessary to express cos w in terms of the angular motions of the planets in their respective orbits. If v represent the angular distance of the disturbed planet in its orbit fron a fixed origin, and P the place of the node, that is, of the intersection of the orbit with the immoveable plane of xy, P being reckoned in the same plane and from the same origin as v, then v -P will be the angular distance of the planet from the node. Further, if A be the celestial arc between the node and the intersection of the orbits of the two planets, the distance of the planet from the same intersection will be equal to vP-A. If the foregoing symbols be accented and transferred with like significations to the disturbing planet, the celestial arc between that planet and the intersection of the orbits will be equal to vP -A'. Now v P A and v'P'A' are two sides of a triangle of which the are o is the third side, wherefore if I be the inclination of the two orbits, we shall have cos = cos (vP A) cos (v'P'A') + cos I sin (v P A) sin (v' P' A'), or, which is the same thing, cos = cos2 I I.cos(v-aV-P P'--A+ A') + sin2 I. cos (v + v'PP' A-A). 562 MR. IVORY ON THE DEVELOPMENT Let N be the place of the node of the disturbed planet reckoned in the immoveable plane of x y, and i the inclination of the orbit to the same plane: then, if v represent the longitude of the intersection of the orbits of the two planets, A will be the hypothenuse of a right-angled triangle, of which i is one angle, and v -N the side adjacent to i; wherefore tan (v N) tan A = Cosi and, by the usual methods, A = v-N + tan2 sin 2 (v N) + tan2 sin 4 (v -N), &u.; and if we put = tan2 4-sin 2 (v-N) + e tan2 4 sin 4 (v -N), &e., we shall have P + A =v + P-N + Let [P N] be the value of P -N at some given epoch: then the differentials of N and P being dN and cos i. dN, we shall have generally, P-N = P-1N]-) dN+ fos i. dN=_[P-NJ-2 asin2 _-dN, the integral being taken for the time elapsed from the epoch. It thus appears that P -N may be considered as an invariable arc, or as one subject to an almost insensible secular equation. In order to abridge expressions, let us now putt [P-N] -2fsin2 4dN +; then -P A=u-v. If the symbols which stand for the elements of the disturbed planet be assumed, when accented, to represent the like elements of the disturbing planet, we shall have similarly, =[P -N] 2fsin2 , dN' + I v'P'-At = v'oG-M OF THE DISTURBING FUNCTION. 563 The value of cos w will now be thus expressed, cos =cos2 I . Cos (v-'-o + on') + sin22 I 1. cos (v + u'a v,'2 v). It remains to determine I, the inclination of the orbits, and v, the longitude of their intersection. Now I is the vertical angle of a triangle of which N N' is the base, and i and i' the adjacent angles, one being interior and the other exterior to the triangle: wherefore cos I-cos i cos i' + sin i sin i' cos (N -N'). In the same triangle, a perpendicular being let fall upon the base from the vertical angle, v N and v -N' are the arcs between the perpendicular and the extremities of the base; and hence, ct (N+ N) N-sin (i-i') N-N' cot v HiJ sin (i + i') .cot --2In the method here followed, the expression of cos w is as simple and as little troublesome in calculation, as it would be if one of the orbits were adopted for the immoveable plane. 2. Let C, s, e, z represent the mean motion, the epoch, the excentricity, and the place of the perihelion, of the disturbed planet at the time for which we are computing: if this time be near the epoch for which the elements have been assigned, the values at the epoch may be taken as the true values; and if a great interval has elapsed, the values at the epoch may be corrected by their secular equations. Further, put p for the mean anomaly, ofor the equation of the centre, a for the mean distance, and a (1s) for the radius vector: then, V= + + U r a (1 -si And the values of o and s, found by the solution of KEPLER'S problem, are expressed by the usual series, viz. 564 MR.

These cosines have the same coefficient, viz. A a(1) (1) ( B) () (1) (1) + A1)(1) 4 4 And this will be found equal to zero, when the values of the symbols are substituted . It thus appears, as far as the calculation has been carried, that there are no terms in the expansion of -roexcept such as contain the mean motions and are periodical. 3. We next proceed to the expansion of which is the more difficult part of the problem. The value of cos w, already investigated, may be thus written, cos = cos (( (p + -C) sin2 I. {Cos ((p-p'+ ?-')-COS ((p + (p'+ Oa + '-2 v) * The coefficient is equal to zero, because a(i) = 6: and for the same reason the coefficient A() (1)B b B(1) b()A 4 +4 is equal to zero. 4 D 2 568 MR.

Although all the coefficients are supposed to be deduced from six of themn, for which alone direct expressions are given, it is nevertheless obvious that an independent formula may be found by which any proposed coefficient may be (k) (k) separately computed: namely, by substituting the values of bh , , &c., in the expressions of the several finite differences. Although there can be no difficulty in applying the formulas, it may not be improper, for the sake of illustration, to take an example. We shall choose the instance of Venus and the Earth. In this case a' will represent the mean distance of the Earth, and a that of Venus: wherefore, o0*7323332 = tan 0 = 710 45' 32", h=3,1947202, log. sin 6 = 9'9776083.

IVORY ON THE DEVELOPMENT expansion of D~, the part of any proposed order with respect to e and e', nothing more is wanting than a method for reducing ,Bv s Cos( PI'+ 0M1) to a series of simple cosines. On this point some observations will be offered below: but, without proceeding further, there is no difficulty in this respect, when we confine our views to quantities not passing the second or third order, which comprehends all the perturbations useful in astronomy, except the inequalities of very long periods. If we combine the planets two and two, as is done in the sixth chapter of the sixth book of the M6canique CUleste, and for every two planets construct a formula such as is exhibited above for Venus and the Earth, limiting the extent of the calculation according to the nature of the case, the theory of the pla. netary disturbances would be rendered more accessible, and would be freed from the tedious and disgusting labour which has rendered astronomers averse from cultivating this branch of their science. 6.
