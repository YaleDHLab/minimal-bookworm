[93] XIV. An Inquiry into the Quantity and Direction of the proper Motion of Arcturus; with some Remarks on the Diminution of the Obliquity of the Ecliptic: By Thomas Hornsby, M. A. Savilian Professor of Astronomy in the University of Oxford, and F. R. S. A S an accurate knowledge of the position of the fixed stars is of the greatest importance, being the basis and foundation of astronomy, it is no wonder that the astronomers of different nations have given great attention to this matter. By comparing antient with the best modern observations, it appears that some of the fixed stars have a proper motion, independent of any motion hitherto known in our own system; or that, in other words, the angular distances of the fixed stars have not always continued the same, and in some of them the alteration is so very considerable as to be easily perceived in the course of a few years, with instruments accurately made, and nicely adjusted. Of all the stars visible in our hemisphere, the variation in the place of Arcturus is the most remarkable, and such as cannot possibly be attributed to the uncertainty of observation. It has accordingly been taken no6 tice Read Dec. 24, 1772. [94] tice of by many astronomers: in particular, Dr. Halley mentions it in No 355 of the Philosophical Transactions: Mr. Cassini, in the Memoirs of the Academy of Sciences for 1738, p. 231, has shewn, that there is a variation of five minutes in the latitude of that star between his own time and that of Tycho, in an interval of a century and a half: and M. le Monnier, in the Memoirs of the Academy of Sciences for 1767, p. 417, proves, that the latitude of Arcturus varies at the rate of two seconds every year; and that the longitude decreases at the rate of 60~ in a hundred years *. But as an inquiry as well into the true quantity as into the direction of this motion has not hitherto been made public, I propose to give some account of my own observations made expressly with this view in the years 1767 and 1768, with a transit instrument of 44 inches, and a moveable mural quadrant of 33 inches, both constructed by Mr. Bird, and of the conclusions resulting from a comparison between them and some observations made by Mr. Flamsteed in 1690. It may perhaps be objected, that the differences of right ascension, as determined by Mr. Flamsteed's mural instrument, are not to be depended upon from the very nature of his instrument. Mr. Flamsteed was himself too good an observer not to be aware of this; and accordingly in the Prolegomena to the third volume of the Historia Caelestis, p. 132, he informs us in what manner he determined the error of * See also the Memoirs of the Academy of Sciences for 1769, p. 21. See also Astronomiae Fundamenta, by the Abbe de la Caille; who, in reducing his observations of Arcturus, supposes the annual motion of declination in that star =19~,0. p. 169, and 187. the [95] the plane at different distances from the zenith. By distributing these errors in the best manner I could, I am of opinion, that the error of the plane of his instrument may be supposed to decrease uniformly at the rate of half a second in time for every degree of zenith distance from 28~ to 60~, the error being 39~ at the former, and 23~ at the latter, by which quantity stars passed the horary wire, in his instrument, before they came to the true meridian. It should seem also that the error continued nearly the same from 60 to 75 degrees, being at the latter only 22~: but that it decreased irregularly from 75~ to 85~, viz. 1~ in time for each degree from 75~ to 80~, and 0~, 4 for each degree from 80~ to 85 degrees. The mural arc was fixed upon a stone pier, the southern part of which was found to settle yearly, from whence the error of the line of collimation to the south necessarily became every successive year greater and greater. As Mr. Flamsteed seems not to have had any method of adjusting his instrument by a plumb-line, these errors must have been irregular at different seasons of the same year, and were perhaps never truly determined. But as the observations here referred to were made on the same day, and within the compass of an hour, they are probably not affected with this latter error. We are at present concerned with the difference of two zenith distances, and not with the absolute quantity of those zenith distances. The conclusions may indeed be affected with an error in the divisions; and from the examination which I have been able to make, I am of opinion that the arc of Mr. Flamsteed's instrument was not of the proper quantity; and that, though the observations generally [96] generally erred in defect, they in some parts erred in excess. On the 14th of February, 1690, Mr. Flamsteed observed, that a small star, of the seventh or eighth magnitude, whose place is not determined in the British catalogue, and which star was named by him Infra Arcturum, preceded Arcturus three seconds in time, or 3~, 3, when an allowance is made for the error of the plane of the instrument= 0~ 42~, 6, and was 26~ 30~ to the south of Arcturus *. By a mean of eight observations made at Oxford, on and near June the 10th, 1767, with the transit instrument, and with a refracting telescope of eight feet, furnished with a micrometer; the difference of right ascension was 1~, 8~, 75 of a degree, the star following Arcturus; and by a mean of three observations, the extremes differing only 3~, the small star was 23~ 55~, 0 to the south of Arcturus. The right ascension of Arcturus and the small star being nearly the same, the change in declination ought to be so likewise. But, from the observed difference in declination, the right ascension of the two stars must vary unequally, though with a very small difference. Accordingly it appears from computation (in which the annual precession is supposed = 50~, 35, the obliquity of the ecliptic at the middle of the interval of the time = 23~ 28~ 30~, and the right ascensions and declinations of the two stars taken at a mean between the times of observation) that the variation of Arcturus in right ascension was 3270~, 6, and of the small star 3277~, 6 in * This is the only observation of that star made by Mr. Flamsteed. 77,28 [97] 77,287 years. Therefore the right ascension of Arcturus alters less than that of the star; and consequently Arcturus should in 1767 have followed the star by 42~,6. But the star was observed to follow Arcturus by 1~ 8~, 75. The right ascension therefore of Arcturus has increased less than that of the star, or Arcturus has moved westward 1~ 51~, 35 in 77,287 years; and has gone southward 2~ 35~ in the same time, supposing the small star not to have moved, which is highly probable. On the same day the difference of right ascension in time between the star n Bootis and Arcturus was 21~ 32~ of mean solar time, = 5~ 24~ 02~, 2, when a proper allowance is made for the going of the clock, and for the error of the plane of the instrument; and the difference of declination was 50~ 45~, 6, when an allowance is made for refraction. On the 24th, 26th, and 29th of May, and the 9th of June, of the year 1768, I determined the difference in right ascension to be 21~ 27~ of sidereal time by the two former observations, and 21~ 263/4~ by the two latter, the difference in declination being 49~ 48~, 7, by a mean of the observations in May, the extremes differing only four seconds. It appears from computation, that between the times of observation the variation of n Bootis in right ascension was 3371~, 7, and 1417~, 3, in declination; of Arcturus 3311~, 7 in right ascension, and 1347~, 9 in declination: The difference of variation in right ascension is 1~ 0~, and of declination 1~ 9~, 4; by the former the difference in right ascension was diminished, and in declination increased by the latter, agreeably to the places of the two stars. The difference in right ascension V O L. LXIII. O there[98] therefore in 1768, if neither of the stars had moved, should have been = 5~ 23~ 02~, 2, and 51~ 55~ in declination; but they were observed to be 5~ 21~ 43~, 4, and 49~ 48~, 7. Arcturus therefore by this observation has in 78,257 years gone 1~ 18~, 8 to the west, and 2~ 06~, 3 to the south, supposing n Bootis not to have any proper motion. On the 5th of April, 1691, the difference in right ascension between n Bootis and Arcturus was 21~ 33~ of mean solar time, = 5~ 24~ 14~, 0; and the difference of declination 50~ 45~, 6, as in the preceding example. The difference of variation in right ascension is 59~, 1, and in declination 1~ 8~, 4~ The difference of right ascension therefore at the latter end of May, 1768, should have been 5~ 23~ 14~, 9, and 51~ 54~, 0 in declination; but, according to observation, they were 5~ 21~ 43~, 4, and 49~ 48~, 7. Arcturus therefore, according to this observation, has moved 1~ 31~, 5 to the west, and 2~ 05~, 3 to the south in 77, 120 years. On the 4th of May, 1691, the difference of right ascension between n Bootis and Arcturus was 21~ 33~ of mean solar time, = 5~ 24~ 14~, 3 when allowance is made for the going of the clock and the error of the plane of the instrument, and the difference of declination on the 3d of May = 50~ 50~, 6. According to computation, those differences should have been 5~ 23~ 15~, 2 and 51~ 59~, 0 respectively; but they were observed to be 5~ 21~ 43~, 4, and 49~ 48~, 7. Arcturus therefore in 77,071 years has moved 1~ 31~, 8 westward, and 2~ 10~, 3 southward. N. B. The zenith-distance of Arcturus, as 7 [99] as determined by Mr. Flamsteed, on the 4th of May, is manifestly erroneous. On the 27th of May, 1692, n Bootis preceded Arcturus in right ascension by 21~ 32~, 5 of mean solar time, = 5~ 24~ 10~, 1, the difference of declination being 50~ 50~, 6. In 75,978 years the difference of right ascension should have been 5~ 23~ 11~, 8 and 51~ 58~, 0 in declination; but those differences were observed to be 5~ 21~ 43~, 4 and 49~ 48~, 7. Arcturus therefore has moved 1~ 28~, 4 westward, and 2~ 09~, 3 southward. On the 27th of May, 1692, Arcturus preceded ~ Bootis in right ascension by 24~ 35~, 5 of mean solar time, = 6~ 9~ 32~, 2, when an allowance is made for the going of the clock and the error of the plane of the instrument, the difference of declination being 3~ 2~ 28~, 9. On the 24th and 26th of May, and 5th of June, 1768, the difference of right ascension between the same stars observed at Oxford was 24~ 44~, 58 of sidereal time, = 6~ 11~ 9~, 1, the difference of declination being 2~ 58~ 24~, 2. In 1768, the difference of right ascension should have been 2~, 7 greater, = 6~ 9~ 34~, 9; and the difference of declination 1~ 31~, 7 less, = 3~ 0~ 57~, 2. But they were observed to be 6~ 11~ 9~, 1, and 2~ 58~ 24~, 2. Arcturus therefore in 75,978 years has, by a comparison with this star, moved 1~ 34~, 2 westward, and 2~ 33~, 0 southward. Again, the difference of declination between Arcturus and ~ Bootis was observed to be 3~ 2~ 33~, 9 on the 14th of February, 1690, when the difference of right ascension between these two stars was not observed by Mr. Flamsteed. It appears by compuO 2 tation, [100] tation, that the difference of variation in declination between the times of observation was 1~ 34~, 5, by which quantity the difference of declination was diminished, and should therefore in 1768 have been 3~ 0~ 59~, 4. But it was 2~ 58~ 24~, 2 by actual observation. Arcturus therefore by this observation has moved southward 2~ 35~, 2 in 78,255 years. By the foregoing comparisons Arcturus appears to have moved as in the following table. Westwd. Southwd. years.

On the 14th of February, 1690, the difference of declination between n and ~ Bootis was observed by Mr. Flamsteed to be = 2~, 1 ~ 47~, 8. By computation, that difference in 1768 should have been 2~ 43~, 9 less, = 2~ 9~ 3~, 9: but it was actually observed [101] observed to be 2~ 8~ 34~, 3 only. The star n Bootis therefore appears by this comparison to have moved southward 29~, 6 in 78,257 years. On the 27th of May, 1692, n Bootis was observed by Mr. Flamsteed to be 2~ 11~ 37~, 8 to the north of ~ Bootis, which quantity should by computation be 2~ 39~, 1 less in 1768, or 2~ 8~ 58~, 7. But it was found to be 2~ 8~ 34~, 3. The star n therefore appears to have moved southward 0~ 24~, 4 in 75,978 years. On the 25th of April, 1693, n Bootis was observed to be 40~ 20~, 8 to the south of f Bootis, a star of the 6th magnitude; and by myself that difference was observed to be 42~ 37~, 5, by taking the mean of two observations on the 24th and 26th of May, 1768, differing only 4~, 7. According to computation, the variation of n Bootis in declination during the interval of the two observations was 1359~, 3, and of f Bootis 1256~, 0; and therefore the difference of variation in declination was 1~ 43~, 3, by which the distance of the stars was increased. The difference in declination therefore in 1768, if neither of the stars moved, should have been 0~ 42~ 04~, 1; but it was observed to be 33~, 4 greater, by which quantity therefore n Bootis must have moved southward in 75,052 years. By reducing all the foregoing deductions to 78 years, Arcturus appears to have moved, Westw. [102] Westw. Southw.

In order to see how far the motion of right ascension is to be depended upon, which is deduced from the above comparisons, I have selected and computed the following observations, made at Shirburn castle [103] castle with a transit instrument of 51/4 feet, placed exactly in the plane of the meridian, and consequently more to be relied upon than those made with a mural instrument. By a mean of five observations, made on the 7th, 12th, 23d, 24th, and 31st of May, 1741, O. S. the difference in right ascension between n Bootis and Arcturus was 5~ 22~ 38~, 9, the extremes differing only 4~, 4 of a degree. The difference in the variation of right ascension to the end of May, 1768, is 20~, 5, by which the ascensional difference is diminished. It should therefore have been 5~ 22~ 18~, 4; but it was observed to be 5~ 21~ 43~, 4. Therefore in 27 years Arcturus has moved westward 35~, 0. On the 16th and 20th of May, 1744, the difference in right ascension between n Bootis and Arcturus was 5~ 22~ 30~, 0 by each of the observations, which difference should have been, supposing neither of the stars to have any proper motion, 5~ 22~ 11~, 7 in May, 1768. But it was found to be 28~, 3 less; by so much therefore had Arcturus moved westward in 24 years. On the 24th of May, and 8th of June, 1746, the difference in right ascension between the same stars was 5~ 22~ 26~, 2, by taking a mean of the two observations; that difference should have been 5~ 22~ 09~, 5 in 1768. But it was observed = 5~ 21~ 43~, 4. Arcturus therefore in 22 years has moved 26~, 1 to the west. Lastly; on the 16th of April, and 27th and 28th of May, 1747, the difference in right ascension between n Bootis and Arcturus, by taking a mean of the three observations, was 5~ 22~ 25~, 0. By computation [104] putation the variation in the difference of right ascension was 16~, 0, by which the ascensional difference should have been diminished, and = 5~ 22~ 09~, 0. But by observation it was found = 5~ 21~ 43~, 4: Arcturus therefore by this last observation appears to have gone 25,6,'' westward. By the observations therefore at Shirburn Castle Arcturus appears to have gone westward as in the following table; in the last column of which are contained the quantities resulting from the observations of each year, reduced to 78 years. ' '' ' '' 1741 0 35,0 1 41,11 1744 0 28,3 1 31,97 1746 0 26,1 1 32,59 1747 0 25,6 1 34,90 Mean 1 35,14 The mean of all the observations, when reduced to an interval of 78 years, is 1~ 35~, 14, which differs only 1~, 17 from the mean of the other comparisons. As then the proper motions of Arcturus westward in right ascension = 1~ 33~, 974, and 2~ 36~, 81 in declination southward, seem well established, the real motion of Arcturus is inclined in an angle of 30~ 56~ to the west of the meridian or horary circle, and to be in that direction 3~ 2~, 81 in 78 years, or at the rate of 2~, 343 in a year. As this direction of its motion is nearly perpendicular to the plane of the ecliptic, the latitude of Arcturus must diminish yearly almost in the same proportion; and its longitude will alter less than that of other stars, though not so considerably as its right ascension. The [105] The proper motion of Arcturus then, in right ascension Westward, being 1~, 205, and in declination 2~, 005, its annual precession in right ascension is 41~, 108, and in declination 19~, 133; and the true right ascension of Arcturus, on Jan. 1, 1773, is 211~ 19~ 47~, 4, and declination North 20~ 22~ 23~, 3. As none of the other principal stars have been found to have a motion so considerable as this, though many of the stars of the first magnitude, as for instance, Sirius, Procyon, ~ Aquilae, ~ Orionis, as also ~ Aquilae of inferior magnitude, do really vary their positions (and perhaps all of the first order will hereafter be found to have a proper motion), we may, I think, fairly conclude that Arcturus is the nearest star to our system, visible in this hemisphere. If therefore the annual parallax of the fixed stars can ever be discovered, that is, if the diameter of the annual orbit bear a sensible proportion to the distance of the nearest fixed star, it is most likely to be discovered from the observations of Arcturus. The system of the world, considered in an enlarged sense, and agreeable to the idea we may entertain of an allpowerful benevolent Creator, may be taken to occupy the whole-abyss of space, and to consist of an assemblage of bodies, having different magnitudes, and emitting various degrees and modifications of light. The apparent change of situation visible from the planet which we inhabit, and which revolves round one of the great bodies constituting a part of the general system, as a center, may be owing either to the motion of our own system in absolute space, or, if our system should be at rest, to a real motion in VOL. LXIII. P the [106] the stars themselves: from whence the angular distances of the stars must vary in proportion to the velocity of those motions, or to the direction of those motions with respect to ourselves. I have reason, at present, to believe that a small motion may be discovered in the star o Ceti, and perhaps in other stars that vary in degrees of brightness, which the diligence of future astronomers will discover, and perhaps in less time than at first sight might seem necessary, when we consider the several improvements which have of late been made in the methods of observing the heavenly bodies. As the motion of Arcturus in declination (the quantity of which we have thus endeavoured to ascertain) has been often acknowledged, it is matter of wonder that some astronomers, by comparing either the altitude or zenith distance of the Sun's limb with Arcturus, without previously settling the quantity of that star's motion in declination, or at least doing it indirectly, should endeavour to determine whether the obliquity of the ecliptic hath remained constant, or still continues to diminish, as it should seem, to have done for many centuries past, from the observations of successive astronomers. Mr. Cassini, and Mr. le Monnier, have both practised this method, and are of opinion, that the obliquity of the ecliptic hath not altered; or, if it hath altered, that the quantity of its alteration is not near so considerable as hath been imagined by some celebrated astronomers. By observing for several days before and after the solstice the altitude or zenith distance of the Sun's limb, and that of a star situated near the same parallel, the differences to be remarked in process of time [107] time in the distances of the Sun from that star (the motion of the star in declination being allowed for during that interval of time), will be the quantity by which the Sun will have approached to or have receded from the star. If the star were absolutely a fixed point, and the observations sufficiently numerous, that, by taking a mean, the necessary and unavoidable errors in observation might either be considerably diminished or almost annihilated, the method might be practised to great advantage. But as the star (Arcturus) had a proper motion, and its apparent place was continually varying from the effect of the nutation of the earth's axis; as the limb of the Sun was sometimes approaching to, and sometimes receding from, the star, by a kind of libratory motion from the effect of the nutation; also and as the obliquity of the ecliptic itself was, in all probability, continually diminishing; from a combination and as it were involution of these motions no certain conclusion could be drawn, since, in the space of a few years, the apparent obliquity may be the same, and yet the mean obliquity may have diminished, or perhaps, in the space of a few years, the obliquity may appear to have increased, when it may really have become less. Whereas, by reducing the observations to their mean position, and by assigning to each known cause its proper and allowed effect, a regularity and uniformity must necessarily take place, as far at least as is consistent with the unavoidable errors in observing. Mr. Cassini, in the Memoirs of the Academy of Sciences for 1767, acquaints us, that, in 1748, the apparent distance of Arcturus from the upper limb P 2 of [108] of the Sun, at the time of the solstice, was the same as in 1766.

As the result of the observations only, and not the observations themselves, are communicated, I have only to observe, that there is a very considerable difference between the conclusions of the two astronomers for the same year 1763, and, at the same time, to declare my suspicion, that if the apparent (for such I apprehend them to be) were reduced to the mean distances, they would probably afford a confirmation of the diminution of the ecliptic. For the following observations of the Sun's zenith distance, made at Shirburn Castle, near the summer solstices of the years 1743, 1746, 1748, and 1766, and of Arcturus in the years 1743, 1746, and 1766, when reduced to their mean state at the solstice, do not confirm the assertion of Mr. Cassini, but are an evident and [110] and absolute proof that the obliquity of the ecliptic has sensibly diminished during an interval of 23, and even of 18 years. The observations of 1743 were made with a mural quadrant of five French feet, constructed by the late Mr. Sisson: but as the linear divisions were found to be somewhat less accurate than was expected, and as the body of the quadrant was not framed with proper strength and solidity, Mr. Bird was employed in the summer of the year 1745, by the Earl of Macclesfield, (the body of the instrument having been strengthened by screwing a large and broad plate of brass upon the cross-bars), to put a set of points upon the limb between the 90 and 96 arches of linear divisions. By these operations the line of collimation was found to have varied, and to be = 6~,3, by which the zenith distances were given too small, by the positive divisions, from the end of 1746 to the end of June 1751, when Mr. Bird bisected the spaces between the points which he had formerly added in 1745. But after the year 1751, the error of the line of collimation was = 2~,6, as appears from observations of ~ Persei, ~ and ~ Draconis, by which the zenith distances are also given too small; and in that state the instrument continued to the year 1767, when a new set of wires was put into the telescope, and the line of collimation thereby altered. The error of the line of collimation from 1743 to 1745 cannot directly be ascertained, for want of zenith observations; but, from some indirect methods, it should seem that the error was as nearly as possible = 2~, to be added to the observed zenith distances. 1743.

By comparing the distance of Arcturus from the center of the Sun in 1743, with the same distance as observed in 1766 (an allowance being made for the proper motion of the star during the interval, as also for its variation in declination arising from the precession 7 [115] cession of the equinoxes), it appears that its distance is 17~,3 less than it would have been, if the distance of the Sun's center from the equator had remained unvaried. By that quantity, therefore, the obliquity of the ecliptic has altered in 23 years; which is at the rate of 75~,2 in 100 years. By comparing, in like manner, the distance in 1746, the obliquity of the ecliptic has diminished 15~,6 in 20 years, or 78~ in 100 years. o ' '' o ' '' Distance in 1743..,.. 2 56 32,8 In 1746. 2 57 28,6 Motion of the star in decl.

Arcturus, therefore, in 1772, should have been 3~ 6~ 29~,2 to the South of the Sun's center, if the angle of the ecliptic and equator had not varied: but that distance was found by actual observation to be 51~,6 less. By so much therefore must the obliquity of the ecliptic have become less in an interval of 82 years; and, consequently, the variation in 100 years will be 62~,92. If the observations of Arcturus be reduced to the solstice of 1771, and the zenith distance of the Sun's center, as observed in that year, be made use of in the same manner, the variation of the obliquity in 81 years will be found = 48~,8, and in 100 years = 60~. If the quantity of the arc of Mr. Flamsteed's instrument were accurately known, the observations which he made at the winter solstice in 1690 might be compared with later observations, in order to determine both the quantity of the obliquity in 1690, and also the variation since his time. Accordingly, I have endeavoured to determine the error of the arc of the instrument between 28~ and 75~ of zenith distance, and proceeded in the following manner. I computed several observations of the stars ~ Tauri, ~ Pleiadum, ~ and ~ Geminorum, and ~, ~, and ~ Sagittarii, as observed by Mr. Flamsteed, in the years 1690, 1691, and 1692, and reducing them VOL. LXIII. R to [122] to the years 1760 and 1766, I compared the differences of declination between those stars, resulting from Mr. Flamsteed's observations, with the differences given by the places of the same stars, as settled by Dr. Bradley in 1760, and also by actual observations of the same stars made at ShirburnCastle in 1766; and, by combining these differences together, I found that the whole arc of 90 degrees was too short by 43~. Supposing the error to be uniform, the proportional part of this quantity, thus found for the solstitial zenith distance of the Sun in June = 13~,4, is nearly confirmed upon the authority of Mr. Flamsteed himself, who, in the prolegomena to the third volume of the Historia Caelestis, where he is deducing the latitude of the Royal Observatory at Greenwich, and the quantity of the obliquity in 1690, from his own observations, allows the zenith distances at 28~, 36~, and 40~, on his instrument, to be too small by 15~ and by 20~, at 75~. I have therefore computed the observations of the Sun, made from November 30 to December 20 of 1690, which, reduced to the solstice, are as in the following table; to which are subjoined the observations made by myself at Oxford, at the winter solstice of 1771. 1690.

I suppose therefore the mean obliquity to be 23~ 28~ 8~ at the beginning of the present year; and consequently, the obliquity has diminished, by my observations, 47~ in 81 years, since Mr. Flamsteed's time, or at the rate of 58~ in 100 years, a quantity which will be found nearly at a mean of the computations framed by Mr. Euler and Mr. de la Lande, upon the principles of attraction.
