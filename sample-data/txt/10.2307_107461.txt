2 103 V. On the length of the French Mdtre estimated in parts of the English standard. By Captain Henry Kater, F. R. So Read February 5, ,8i8. oNE Of the objects of the committee of the Royal Society appointed for the purpose of determining the length of the seconds pendulum, being the comparison of the French metre with the British standard measure, two metres were procured from Paris for that purpose, the one made in the usual manner and called the metre a bouts, and the other a bar of platina on which the length of the mrtre is shown by two very fine lines; this is named the inetre a traits. The width of the mne're a bouts is one inch, and its thickness 0, of an inch. On one side the word "METRE " is engraved, and on the other '" FORTIN a PARIS." The terminating planes are supposed to be perfectly parallel, and the distance between them is the length of the metre. The me'tre a traits is the same width as the metre a bouts, but only a quarter of an inch thick. The-lines expressing the length of the metre are so fine that one of them is scarcely perceptible even with the assistance of a microscope, unless the light be very favourable. The situation-of the lines may however be discovered by two strong black dots made with a graver at the extremities of each, and a fine line crosses them at right angles to indicate the parts from which the measurements are to be taken. This metre previous to being brought from Paris, was 104 Capt. KATER on he ength of e Frerch me'tre compared withl a standard m6tre by M. AIAGO, with all that care and ability which he is so well known to possess, and which so delicate an operation requires. The result was, that the distance between the lines was found to be less than a metre by ,-,,O of a millimntre or .00o69 of an inch. The same micrometer microscopes were usedi'n the com parisons which I am about to detail, as have been already described in my account of experiments on the length of the pendulum, in the Philosophical Transactionis of the present year, and as the length of the metre is nearly 94, inclhes, I was enabled to refer it to the same divisions of Sir GEORGE SHUCKBURGH'S scale as I had employed in the measurement of the pendulum. I commenced with the meitre 2 traits. It was placed in contact with the standard scale, their surfaces being in the same plane. An excellent thermometer was laid upon the scale, and a piece of thick leather wals placed upn its bulb in order to prevent its being affected by heat from the person of the observer. The whole was suffered to remain in this state for two or three days, after which the following observations were made at various times, the microscopes being brought alternately over the metre and the scale. The value of each division of the micrometer is, of an inch.* * For the manner in which this value was obtained, see page Si of the preceding paper. e tMzated in parts of the Lng his/z standardc Comparison of the me'tre a' traits.

MIDCCCXVIII. P :106 Capt. KATER on the length of the French melre Four rectangular pieces of brass w'rere prepared precisely similar to those described in the account of experiments on the pendulum in the Philosophical Transactions before referred to. These were marked C, c, D and d. The perfectly plane rectangular edges of the pieces C and c, being placed in contact, and kept thus by means of a spring, the distance of the fine lines drawn on their surfaces, parallel and very near to the rectangular edges, was found to be 500,5 divisions of the micrometer, and the pieces D and d' being placed in like manner in contact, the distance of the lines on their surfaces estimated in the same divisions was 456X7. The rnetre a bouts being placed by the side of the brass scale and in contact with it, the pieces D and dc were applied to its extremities, the surfaces of the brass pieces being a little below the surface of the metre in order to preclude any error which might have arisen from the edges of the metre projecting beyond its terminating planes. Each of the brass pieces was supported in this position upon a piece of lead of a sufficient thickness, and kept in close contact with the end of the metre by means of a slight spring, bearing against a pin driven perpendicularly into the lead. In order to ensure a perfect contact between each brass piece and the terminating plane of the metre, a flat ruler of brass. was laid upon the surface of the metre so as to project beyond its extremity, and the end of the lead was elevated -or depressed so that the line of light seen between the piece of brass and. the ruler, the eye being level with the surface oi htie brass, appeared to be equal in every part, when it was,,-,,1rred that the surfaces of the metre and of the piece of estimateJ, Ith E ngish stand. 07 brass were parallel, and consequently that their rectangular ends were perfectly in contact. The distanc betx een the lines on D and d was now taken by the microscopes and transferred to the scale in the manner before described ; and when a suffcient number of comparisons had thus been made, the pieces D and d, were exchanged for those marked C and c, and the observations repeated with every precaution to ensure 'n accurate result especially with respect to temperature. The under surface of the metre was then placed uppermost, and the apparatus being arranged as before, the same process was pursued as that which has just been described. The results are contained in the followling tables. Comparison of the 'Xtre d bots. The pieces D and d, applied. Distance fror D to d, 456,7 divisions.

The following is the manner in which the correction for temperature was obtained. The expansion of platina accord-. ing to the experiments of BORDA and others, is ,ooooo4076 esti'nated in parts of the English standard. 0og parts of its length for one degree of FAHRENHEIT, and as this is the expansion used by the French in adjusting the length of their me'tre, it must be employed on the present occasion. The metre being taken at 32D, the expansion for the difference between this and the temperature of measurement, must be subtracted from the apparent length of the metre. The English standard temperature is 620, therefore if the temperature of measurement be under this, the expansion of the scale for such difference of temperature must be deducted from the length of the metre before obtained. These two corrections are combined in the column entitled C correction for temperature." Sir G. SHIJCKBURGH'S standard scale is of cast brass, and as I' could not conveniently determine its actual expansion with that degree of accuracy that would have satisfied me, I have taken for it, the mean result of two experiments made on plate brass, which gave me an expansion of ,ooooioi parts of its length for one degree of FAHRENHEIT. The mean of most of the experiments made on the expansion of brass gives ,oooo0o4, and had Iemployed this last number instead of my own, the difference in the length of the metre would have been utterly inconsiderable. Supposing then both metres to be of equal authority, we have for the length of the metre a traits 39,37076, and for that of the me'tre d bouts 39,37081 inches; the mean of which, 39,37079, nay be takenfor the length of the metre in inches of Sir G. SHUCKBURGIW's standard scale when each is brought to its proper temperature.* The length of the me'tre compared with BIRD'S parliamentary standard, is 39,37O62 inches. London, Novemnber 18 X7.
