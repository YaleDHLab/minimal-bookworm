[ 257 ] XVI. On the Relation between Boiling-pont and Composition in Organc Compounds. By HERMANN KOPP, JLD., Ph.D., Professor of Theoretical Chemistry in the University of Giessen. Communicated by Dr. A. W. HOFMANN. Received March 20,-Read May 3, 1860. THE researches which I beg, in the following pages, to submit to the Royal Society, embody the results obtained in the further development of an observation which I made a considerable number of years ago, and which, since that time, I had to defend against the objections of others, both by experimental inquiries of my own, and by the collection and discussion of facts elicited in the investigations of other observers. As far back as 1841* I pointed out that in analogous compounds the same difference of composition frequently involves the same difference in boiling-points. The assertion of the existence of this law-like relation between the chemical composition of substances and one of their most important physical properties, when first enunciated, met rather with the opposition than with the assent of chemists. In Germany especially it was contested by SCIIROnDER in his memoir "On the Molecular Volume of Chemical Compoundst." These objections led me to collect additional evidence$ in favour of my views, and to show more particularly that in very extensive series of compounds (alcohols C. Hl+2 02; acids CQ HnO4; compound ethers Cn HnO4, &c.) an elementary difference XC2 11 is attended by a difference of x X l 90 C. in the boiling-points, and how this fact is intimately connected with other regularities exhibited by the boiling-points of organic compounds. Almost at the same period SCHRODER ? convinced himself that the relation I had pointed out obtains in most cases. He collected himself a considerable number of illustrations of the regularities I had traced, and showed that the relation in question is rendered more especially conspicuous if the compounds be expressed by formulae representing equal vapour-volumes of the several substances. Some of the views, however, which were peculiar to SCIIR6DER have not gained the approbation of chemists. This physicist was inclined to consider the boiling-point of a substance as the most essential criterion of its proximate constituents, as the most trustworthy indicator of its molecular constitution. His views were chiefly based upon the assumption that the elementary difference C2 H2, when occurring in alcohols C. H,202, involved a difference of boiling-points other than that occasioned by the same elementary difference obtaining in acids Ci H. 4,* Ann. der Chem. und Pharm. vol. xlix. pp. 71 and 169. t Ueber die Molecular-Volume der Chemischen Verbindungeln, 1843. 4 Ann. der Chem. und Pharn. vol. 1. p. 128. ?

HMRMANN KOPP ON T1lE RELATION BETWEEN BOILING-POINT and that the isomeric compound ethers differed from one another in their boiling-points. An extensive series of boiling-point determinations * which I made of these isomeric ethers, proved that the latter assumption is not founded on facts. The exertionsmade by SCHR6DER, GERHARDT, L6WIG and others, in the hope of recognizing the influence of the constituent elements on the boiling-point of a compound, have also essentially remained without result t. In France the existence of the relations between composition and boiling-point which I had observed, has been contested by I. PIERRE$, who determined the boiling-points of many organic compounds, while engaged in an inquiry regarding their expansion. In England, lastly, W. A. MILLER has likewise called attention to the discrepancies between the boiling-points observed by PIERRE and those calculated on the supposed existence of the relations which I had indicated. I was, however, enabled fl to remove these apparent discrepancies by the first results obtained in a long series of experimental observations of my own, in which, at intervals and as material and opportunities presented themselves, I have continued up to the present day. The existence of the relations between composition and boiling-point, such as it results from my original observations, has, notwithstanding these objections, been generally acknowledged. In many cases the recognition of these relations furnished important arguments in discussions regarding the true molecular value of organic compounds. Chemists have observed a vast number of new illustrations, and for several series, in which the individual terms differ from each other by a constant elementary difference, the corresponding difference of boiling-point has been carefully determined?. Nevertheless, these relations, the important means of control which they afford in experimental inquiries, and the assistance which they are frequently capable of lending in the determination of the true chemical character of a new compound, have scarcely been sufficiently appreciated. The rapid progress of organic chemistry has greatly expanded the material available for the discussion of boiling-points, and up to the latest date the stream of experimental inquiry, whilst confirming or correcting former observations, has furnished a rich supply of additional important facts. The time has arrived when a survey of the territory safely acquired may be taken, and when from the boundary lines reached we may fix the directions in which we have next to advance. A collection of my researches on this subject in a connected form, permitting this survey, and showing the results which may be expected from their application, I now beg leave to submit to the Royal Society, hoping that their attention may not be with-Ann. der Chem. und Pharm. vol. lv. p. 166. t In reviewing ScER6bER'uS memoir on this subject, I have pointed out the reasons which render the general solution of this problem almost hopeless.-POGG.

[4] ix. 256) has determined the difference of the boiling-points for the series of hydrocarbons Cl HI)_6, deserves especially to be mentioned. AND COMPOSITION IN ORGANIC COMPOUNDS. 259 held from a field where our knowledge, emanating from earlier observations, but expanded and consolidated more than ever before by recent experimental evidence, has already gained a solid foundation. It is especially with regard to organic compounds that constant relations between boiling-point and composition have been demonstrated. It often occurs that in the case of analogous compounds the same difference in the boiling-points corresponds to the same difference in the chemical formulae, or that the differences in boiling-points and those in composition are proportional. In different, series of analogous compounds the same differences of boiling-point may correspond to the same differences of composition, but this does not obtain in all series. The regularities exhibited by the boiling-points of organic compounds, and more especially the observation of the same difference of boiling-point corresponding to the same difference of composition, are limited to certain groups. In other groups, the same difference in the formulae involves another difference in the boiling-points. Among the earliest recognized regularities, comprising at the same time the largest number of compounds, are the following :-An alcohol CQ Hf?2 02, which contains x C2 H2 more or less than another, boils at a temperature xx 190 higher or lower. An acid CnHn 04, boils at a temperature 400 higher than the alcohol C Hn12 02, the oxidation of which may give rise to the acid. A compound ether CQ Hn 04, boils at a temperature 82? lower than the acid Cn Hn 04 isomeric with it. If we start from the boiling-point of ethyl-alcohol =780, these three propositions enable us to calculate the boiling-points of a large number of organic substances, alcohols, acids, and compound ethers, represented by the above general formulae, as given in the following Table: TABLE I.

There can be no doubt that if the boiling points of -other alcohols, acids, and ethers belonging to these series were correctly observed, they also would agree within a few degrees with those obtained by calculation. The boiling-points given in Table 1. are closely connected with those of other monatomic alcohols with two equivalents of oxygen, of other monobasic acids with four equivalents of oxygen, and of the ethers generated by these acids and alcohols. It is frequently observed that a compound of this kind, which, when compared with an analogous body of Table I., contains xx C more or less, boils at a temperature X 140.5 higher or lower, or (what amounts to the same thing) that it boils at a temperature X 50 lower or higher, accordingly as it contains x X H more or less. Benzoic acid, C14 H6 04, for example, contains 8 C more than the acid C6 H6 04, the boiling-point of which is stated in Table I. at 1370. Consequently the boiling-point ofbenzoic acid will be 137+8 x 14? 5=253. It contains 81 less than the acid C 114 04, for the boiling-point of which the Table gives 213, and its boiling-point by calculation will be 213+8x5=253. Allyl-alcohol, C6H6 02, contains 2 C more than ethyl-alcohol, C4 1602, which boils as 780; the calculated boiling-point of allyl-alcohol accordingly is 78+2 X 14-5 =1 07; or it may be compared to the alcohol C6 11802, the boiling-point of which is 970 (see Table I.), when the boiling-point of allyl-alcohol, which contains 2H less, will be found by calculation-EL 07 (= 9 7 + 2 x 5). The following synopsis shows in how large a number of alcohols C, H.m 02, of acids and ethers C,, 113[m 04, the boiling-points obey this simple rule. In perusing this Table, 262 DR. HERMANN KOPP ON THE RELATION BETWEEN BOILING-POINT it must be borne in mind that the observations of boiling-points comprised in the higher ranges of the thermometer are frequently less accurate.

In all the series of analogous combinations quoted in the previous Tables, a compound containing in its formula X C2 H2 more than another is found to boil at a temperature x X 19' higher. The same regularity obtains in other series of analogous compounds, but by no means in all. A few other groups may also be mentioned here, in which the observed boiling-points exhibit the above regularity, at all events within the limits of uncertainty usual in boiling-point determinations.

Since, as I have already remarked, the regularity in question is not altogether general, it may often be doubtful whether it exists or not when the observations of the boiling-points present considerable discrepancies and uncertainties in several terms of an homologous series. As an example, the following series may be quoted:TABLE IX. Assumed. Observed boiling-point. Cyanide of Methyl ...... C41 H N 79 Kopp, 72'; Dumas, 770; Buckton and Hofmann, 770?-78?.

C 2 The comparison of the boiling-points of the corresponding terms in the several series of homologous substances given in the preceding Tables, exhibits several other constant differences in the boiling-points for certain differences in the formuh. In addition 264 DR. HERMANN KOPP ON THE RELATION BETWEEN BOILING-POINT to those hitherto noticed, the following also deserve to be mentioned, since they are likewise observed in other compounds. The foregoing Tables afford many illustrations of the facts, that the boiling-point of an acid lies 630 higher than that of the methyl-ether, 440 higher than that of the ethyl-ether, and 130 lower than that of the amyl-ether of the same acid. These regularities appear to obtain in the case of acids other than those quoted. The boiling-point of monochloracetic acid (185?-188?, R. HOFFMANN) has been found about 440 higher than that of the monochloracetate of ethyl (143?5, WILLM). Starting from the boiling-point of trichloracetate of methyl (145?, LAURENT), or from that of trichloracetate of ethyl (1640, LEBLANC), the boiling-point of trichloracetic acid is found by calculation to be 208?. DUMAS found it between 195? and 2000. From the boiling-point of monobromacetic acid, 2080, observed by PERKIN and DUPPA, that of the corresponding methyl-ether may be calculated at 1450, that of the ethyl-ether at 1640, and that of the amyl-ether at 2210. The results of observation are 144?, 1590, 207?. They are not, however, entirely to be relied upon, since the ethers of monobromacetic acid, and especially those possessing higher boiling-points, are partially decomposed by ebullition. In a few substances other than acids, the substitution of C4 H1 for H is occasionally attended by a decrease of 440 in the boiling-point; that of C2 H3 for H by a decrease of 63?. Ordinary (ethyl) ether, C8 iO 02 boils at 340, t. e. 440 lower than ethyl-alcohol, C4 H6 02; methyl-amyl-ether, C,, H14 0? at 720 (WILLIAMSON), i. e. 630 lower than amylalcohol, CI0 H12 02. If any doubt remained as to the expediency of representing ordinary ether by the formula C8 1 02 = (C4 H5) (C4 H5) 02, instead of the formula C4 H, 0, this observation might be of some importance; but the comparison of the boiling-points of alcohols and of so-called simple and mixed ethers, shows that the aforesaid regularity is not general, a circumstance arising from the fact of the elementary difference C2 H2, in the series of ethers Cn Hf?n+2 02, involving a difference of boiling-points other than that corresponding to the elementary difference C2 H2 in the series of alcohols Cn Hn+2 02. The preceding Tables contain a great number of illustrations of the facts, that many compounds containing benzoyl (C14 H1 02) or benzyl (C14 H7) boil at a temperature 780 higher than the corresponding compounds of valeryl (C10 H1902) or of amyl (C1O HJ. The benzoyland benzyl-compounds, when compared with the compounds of valeryl and amyl, contain 4C more and 4H less. They boil mostly, in accordance with the rules given (page 26 1), at a temperature (4 x 140o5) +(4 x 5?) = 78? higher. In addition to the compounds, the boiling-points of which have already been given, the following exhibit the same regularity. [The mixed acetone A is the one obtained by the distillation of a mixture of an acetate and benzoate; the acetone B is that formed by distilling an acetate and valerate. Hydride of benzyl is identical with toluol, chloride of benzyl with monochlorinated toluol.] AND COMPOSITION IN ORGANIC COMPOUNDS. 265 TABLE X. Observed boiling-point. Hydride of Benzoyl .........

This regularity does not, however, obtain in a general manner, as will be apparent by comparing the boiling-points of cyanide of phenyl (benzonitrile, FEILING, KOPP, 1910; LIMPRICHT, 192 ) and of cyanide of butyl (valeronitrile, SCHLIEPER, 1250; GUCKELBERGER, from 1250 to 1280), or the boiling-points of toluidine (MUSPRATT and HOPMANN, 1980) and of amylamine (BRAZIER and GOSSLETH, 930; WURTZ, 950). The boiling-points of the terms of several series which have been previously mentioned frequently almost coincide, a circumstance which furnishes a valuable means of controlling boiling-point observations. If, for example, in a series of methyl-ethers, corresponding to various monobasic acids with four equivalents of oxygen, and in the chlorides of the radicals contained in the same acids, the boiling-points be found so near to each other as is shown in the following Table,.TABLE XI.

It is evident from the preceding Tables that phenyl-alcohol, acetate, cenanthylate, and caprylate of phenyl boil at a temperature 1160 higher than the corresponding ethyl-compounds (phenyl contains 8C more than ethyl, 8 x 14-5 =116?). The same difference is not observed in all correspondingphenyland ethyl-com'pounds, yet it occurs in cases other than those already mentioned, or which may be readily inferred from the regularities jpreviously alluded to. Thus the boiling-point of iodide of phenyl (SCRUGHAM, 1900) is likewise about 1160 higher than that of iodide of ethyl (PIERRE, 700; ANDREWS, 710; FRANKLAND, 720). It deserves also to be noticed that the boiling-points of acetate of phenyl (SCRUGHAM, 1880) and of iodide of phenyl (SCRUGHAM, 1900) are as near to each other as those of acetate of ethyl (740) and of iodide of ethyl (70?~-720); and that the same difference is observed between the boiling-points of iodide of phenyl (1900) and of iodide of ethyl (700-720) as between those of chloride of phenyl (SCRUGHA , 1360) and of chloride of ethyl (PIERRE, 110; THE-NARD, 12 ). The compounds of allyl contain 2 C more in their formulae than the corresponding ethyl-compounds. The difference in the boiling-points 2 x 140.5= 290 occurs not only in the compounds already quoted (the alcohols, acetates, butyrates, valerates, benzoates), but also approximately at least in the cyanates (cyanate of ethyl 600, according to WURTZ; cyanate of allyl 82?, according to CAHOURS and TIOFMANN); in the iodides (iodide of ethyl 700, according to PIERRE; 720, according to FRANiLAND; iodide of allyl 1010, according to BERTIJELOT and LUCA); in the ethyl-ethers (ordinary ethyl-ether, C, H,, 0?, 340; allylethyl-ether, C, H, 02, 620.5, according to BERTHELOT and LUcA); and even in the aldehydes (acetic aldehyde, C4 H14 , 200, according to Kopp; 22', according to LIEBIG and to PIERRE; acrolein, 0 H1 40, about 520, according to REDTENBACHER). But in the case also of corresponding ethyl and allyl compounds, the difference in the boiling-points is by no means altogether constant, as is apparent from a comparison of the boiling-points of sulphocyanide of ethyl (1460, according to CAILOURS) and of sulphocyanide of allyl (1430, according to DUMAS and PELOUZE; 148', according to WILL; 1510, according to Kopp). If, on comparing the parallel terms of different series of compounds, we do not quite generally meet with the same difference in the boiling-points corresponding to the same AND COMPOSITION IN ORG1ANIC COMPOUNDS. 267 difference in composition, this fact arises from the circumstance that the same difference in the formulae by no means involves the same difference of boiling-point in all series of homologous substances. For the series of the monatomic alcohols with two equivalents of oxygen, of the monobasic acids with four equivalents of oxygen, of the ethers to which both classes give rise, as well as for a few other series of homologous substances (see Table VIII.), the elementary difference x C2 H2 seems to involve a difference of boiling-point x x 190; but there are other series of homologous bodies in which the same elementary difference is positively attended by another, greater or smaller, difference of boiling-point. This difference is greater, for example, in the series of hydrocarbons C. Hn_-G in which it amounts to about 240. TABLE XIII. Benzol.....C 12 ......

HERMANN KOPP ON THE RELATION BETWEEN BOILING-POINT There can be no doubt that in different series of homologous compounds the difference of boiling-point corresponding to the elementary difference x C2 112 may vary; that frequently it is found to be x X 19', but sometimes more, sometimes less. As to these inequalities of differences, they are sure to be governed by a more general law, which will probably be recognized when a sufficient number of boiling-points shall have been determined under a pressure different from the ordinary pressure of the atmosphere; for it cannot by any means be taken for granted that two substances will exhibit the same difference of boiling-point, whatever may be the pressure. Let S and S, be the boiling-points of two liquids under the ordinary pressure, and s and s, the boiling-points under another pressure. Then the assumption of S-S1 =s s, would involve the inference S-s= S,-s; i. e. that the boiling-points must undergo precisely the same change for the same change of pressure. But this conclusion, the so-called law of DALTON, is by no means correct; and it may be legitimately held that the homologous substances which under the ordinary pressure do not exhibit the most frequently observed difference of boiling-point (190) for the elementary difference C2H2, would certainly show that difference under a different pressure. Sufficient data are still wanting for the appreciation of the mode in which differences in boiling-points are affected by changes of pressure. But the extent of these alterations may in a measure be inferred from the fact that the difference in boiling-points of alcohol and ether, which, under the ordinary pressure, amounts to about 440, from what is known with respect to the vapour-tension of these two substances at different temperatures, would, under the pressure of half an atmosphere, be above 45?, and below 400 under a pressure of three atmospheres. From the observations at present at our disposal, it may be affirmed as a general rule, that in homologous compounds belonging to the same series, the differences in boilingpoints are proportional to the differences of the formula. Exceptions obtain only in cases in which terms of a particular group are rather difficult to prepare, or when the substances boil at a very high temperature, at which the observations now at our command are for the most part uncertain. Again, it may be affirmed that the difference in boiling-points corresponding to the elementary difference C2 H2, is in a great many series =190; in some series more, in some series less. There are a few quite exceptional cases in which the higher terms of a homologous series boil at a lower temperature than the inferior terms. A case in point exists according to WURTZ in the glycols.

C_ 104 177 AND COMPOSITION IN ORGANIC COMPOUNDS. 271 The ethers which arise from the combination of these bodies with acids CQ H11O4, exhibit on the other hand boiling-points rising with the increasing number of carbonatoms. And this remark applies not only to those ethers of the glycols which contain. two molecules of an acid-radical (compare Table XX.), but also to those in which only one of the two basic hydrogen ,equivalents of ethyl-glycol is replaced by an acid-radical.

Louren(o, about 240?. One more example of a compound exhibiting a boiling-point lower than that of its lower homologue is offered by the cyanurates of methyl and ethyl. According to WURTZ'S earlier experiments, cyanurate of methyl, C012H930 6, boils at 295?; according to a later observation, at 2740; cyanurate of ethyl, C181 H1 N3 06, according to the earlier observation, at 2760; according to the later, at 2530. The boiling-points of the cyanic e-thers, on the other hand, rise with the increase of the number of carbon-atoms; cyanate of methyl, C4 H3 N 02 (boiling-point 400, WURTZ), and cyanate of ethyl, 06 H5 N 02 (boilingpoint 600, WURTZ), exhibit the difference of boiling-points usual in this kind of ethers. Isomeric compounds belonging to the same type, and possessing the same chemical character, have the same boiling-point. This seems to follow from the boiling-points, such as have been observed for isomeric ethers Cn Hn 04 (Table IV.); for ethers 0Q Hn-_ 0? and 0 Hn_1004 (Table VII.); and for so-called simple and mixed radicals Cn0H,1+2 (Table XIV.). Boiling-points, which at any rate very nearly approach each other, have also been observed for the isomeric ethers 01 Hn1.2 02 (see Table XVI.). For the isomeric ethers On Hn-2 08, observation has hitherto yielded boiling-points which sometimes agree, sometimes differ. As yet no sufficient grounds exist for attributing different boilingpoints to isomeric compounds of the same type and the same chemical character. It may sometimes be difficult experimentally to prove the identity of the boiling-point of two such compounds as an ethyl-ether and the isomeric methyl-compound. The methylcompounds have in general so great a tendency to boil irregularly, and at temperatures anomalously raised, that quiet ebullition permitting the observation of the correct boiling-point is often scarcely to be attained. Isomeric compounds belonging to the same type, but possessing a different chemical character, have different boiling-points. This is evident, e. g., from a comparison of the acids and ethers 0n Hn 04 (Tables III. and IV.); of the acids and ethers 0n H,-H 04 0n, Hn-8 04, or 0 _ Hn-10 04 (Tables VI. and VII.); of the alcohols and ethers C01 H1+2 0 (Tables II. and XVI.); of the mercaptans and the sulphur-compounds isomeric with them 01H1 +2 S2 (Table XVIII.). Isomeric compounds belonging to different types have different boiling-points. Allyl272 DR. HERMANN KOPP ON THE RELATION BETWEEN BOILING-POINT alcohol, C61602, boils (CAHOURS and HOFMANN) at 1030. (From Table V. this boilingpoint was calculated at 1070.) Acetone, C6 H160 , isomeric with the former, boils at 560 (LIEBIG, IDUMAS, KOPP). In cases like the last, the determination of the boiling-point of a compound, together with an examination of the substances with which the compound is serially allied in boiling-point, may be of great assistance in fixing its character, the type to which it belongs, and the series of homologous bodies of which it is a term. The examples just quoted of the fact that isomeric substances of different series possess different boilingpoints, may here again serve as illustrations. The boiling-point of the so-called eugenicacid (BRUNING, 2480; WILLIAMS, 2510) shows that this substance, although represented by the formula 2 11,2 04, cannot possibly be homologous to benzoic acid, C14 H1 04 (boiling-point observed by Kopp, 2500; calculated, Table VI., 2530). This result might be inferred with the greatest probability from the boiling-point of the two substances, even if cuminic acid, isomeric with eugenic acid, and the homologue of benzoic acid, were not known. On the other hand, when the boiling-points of eugenic acid and of hydride of salicyl, C4 H1604 (boiling-point 1960, PIRIA), are considered, it becomes extremely probable that these two bodies are homologous. (To the difference in composition, C61H6 -3 C2 H2, corresponds in this case the difference in boiling-points 250 196=54=3 X 18.) The boiling-points of polymeric compounds are also different, and may serve to determine the formula representing a substance. Among the isomeric compounds, in the narrower sense of the word, acids and ethers (of the common formula C. HE 04, for example), or alcohols and ethers (of the common formula Cn Hn+2 02, e. g.), exhibit in all their bearings an essentially different character. Less striking is the difference of chemical character in the various volatile bases; and it is only since the last ten years that distinctive features have been traced in several classes of these bases, which have accordingly been subdivided into primary, secondary, and tertiary monamines. The basic character possessed by all these substances has induced many to compare their boiling-points also, without duly considering to which of the several classes they might belong. But in this case, again a comparison of boiling-points is admissible only for such bases as belong to one and the same of the abovementioned classes. The same formula, CIO H13 N, represents amylamine, propyl-ethylamine, and methyl-diethylamine; but of these three bases, only the first can be compared, as to boiling-point, with methylamine and ethylamine as a true homologue. The three isomeric bases above mentioned have indeed different boiling-points, just as ethylalcohol and -methyl-ether, isomeric compounds (both C4 11602), have different boilingpoints. We may, however, expect that methyl-propylamine and diethylamine, both isomeric bases of the same chemical character (both secondary monamines), will have the same boiling-point, just as in the case of the isomeric ethers of the same chemical character, propionate of methyl and acetate of ethyl. Homologous bases of the common formula Cn Hn1 , N appear to exhibit, at least approximately, for aP difference in the formuke =C2 H, a difference in boiling-points AND COMPOSITION IN ORGANIC COMPOUNDS. 273 =x x 1 9.

The discrepancies are by no means great in the case of the isomeric terms of the primary and secondary monamines,. but considerable enough in the case of the tertiary monamines compared with the two previous classes, so that the bases belonging to the third class may be distinctly recognized. Dimethylaniline may be expected to exhibit the same boiling-point as collidine, isomeric with it, and likewise a tertiary monamine. The relation mentioned (page 261), viz. that for certain classes of alcohols, acids and ethers, a boiling-point x X 140.5 higher or lower corresponds to x C more or less in the formula, is in general not observed on comparing the bases of the first and second class; but the boiling-points of a large number of tertiary monamines, such as they are calcu*lated from the (assumed) boiling-points of the last Table, coincide tolerably well with the results of observation.MDCCCL~X. 2 O 274 DR.

Accordingly in the last two series also the difference in boiling-point (190) seems, at all events approximately, to correspond to the elementary difference C2 112. We meet, however, with an exception in the boiling-point of trimethylamine, C6 H9 N, a base likewise belonging to the tertiary monamines, which, according to WINKLES, lies between 40 and 50 The general formula C0 H.,3 N represents volatile bases of the three classes. What is known with regard to the boiling-points of the tertiary monamines has already been stated. With respect to the secondary, HOFMANN'S determination of the boilingpoints of diethylamine, C8 H, N 570 5 of diamylamine, C25 H193 N, = about 1700, also exhibits for the difference of composition xC2 12, a difference in boiling-points of 190 (170-57=6x19?). The difference is greater for the primary bases C0H 1AN; the boiling-points assumed in the following Table are based on the supposition that it equals 25?. TABLE XXVIII. Assumed.

In the case of the bases C0 ,Hn, N, it does not appear that the isomeric terms belonging to the classes of secondary and tertiary monamines can be distinguished by means * The trimethylamine used by M. WNTKLES, in determining the boiling-point, had been prepared from the brine of salted herrings. Whilst Professor Kopp's paper was passing through the press, I had an opportunity of determining the boiling-point of perfectly pure trimethylaminie, prepared by the action of potassa on iodide of tetramethylammoniun. This determination, made with about 10 grins. of base, gave the boiling-point 9`3. The ebullition of trimethylamine exhibits the irregularity so frequently observed in methyl-compounds. When the liquid ceases to boil freely, the thermometer is observed to indicate as much as 140 and even 15?, but the mercury falls again suddenly to 90.3, when ebullition recommences. It deserves to be noticed, that trimethylphosphine exhibits a similarly discrepant boiling-point. The boiling-point of trimethyiphosphine was found between 40? and 42?, that of triethylphosphine being 127 5.-A. W. I. AND COMPOSITION IN ORGANIC COMPOUNDS.2 :of their boiling-points; but the boiling-points of the primary monamines greatly differ from those of the isomeric bases of the two previous classes. Constant relations then between the boiling-points and the formula of the volatile organic compounds may be said to have been most positively established by the preceding statements. Their existence cannot be called in question on account of their not always being manifested exactly in the same manner. Such uniformity would obtain if in all homologous series the difference in boiling-points corresponding to the difference of composition 02 H2 were equally great; if, as a general rule, on comparing two corresponding pairs of compounds the same difference in composition were found to involve the same difference in boiling-point. The fact of these relations obtaining in a less general and simple manner renders their perception, as also their use in determining the formulae of chemical compounds, more difficult, but does not set them aside, any more than the existence of a relation between chemical composition and crystalline *form could be denied, on account of its not always manifesting itself in the simplest form, or the assistance be doubted, which the study of crystalline form often renders in establishing the formula of a substance, because compounds of altogether different atomic constitution may possess the same form, or compounds of analogous constitution, even containing so-called isomorphous elements, are observed to crystallize in forms altogether different. Relations between boiling-point and composition have been more especially proved in organic compounds; very many of them, being volatile at comparatively low temperatures, admit of their boiling-point being accurately determined. It is, however, in the nature of the case that they should not be limited to the domain of organic chemistry. Nevertheless relations of this description have not hitherto been comprehensively proved to exist in inorganic bodies. Tribromide of arsenic, As Br3 (boiling-point 2200), and trichloride of arsenic, As Cl, (133?), exhibit nearly the same difference as oxybromide of phosphorus, PO2 Br3 (1950), and oxychloride of phosphorus, PO Cl3 (1100), and also nearly the same as the following organic compounds (exhibiting a similar difference in their formula), bromoform, C2 H Br3 (1520), and chloroform, 02 H Cl3 (62?). In these cases the substitution of 3 Br for 3 C1 is attended by an elevation of the boiling-point amounting to from 850 to 900=3 x 28 to 3 X 30. But the substitution of x Br for x C1 by no means involves invariably an elevation of the boiling-point of from x 280 to x 300. Although earlier observations had pointed to these simple relations, and raised the hope that a knowledge of the differences in the boiling-points of corresponding bromine and chlorine compounds would be available for ascertaining how many equivalents of bromine in a substance are substituted for chlorine in another, yet the determination of the boilingpoints of a very large number of corresponding bromine and chlorine compounds has unmistakeably shown that so simple a relation does not obtain, and cannot therefore throw any light upon the formulk of such substances. The recognition then of definite relations between composition and boiling-point is for the present chiefly limited to organic compounds. For the majority of these com276 ON THE RELATION BETWEEN BOILING-POINT AND COMPOSITION. pounds, and indeed for the more important ones, this relation assumes the form of a simple law, which, more especially for the monatomic alcohols C. Hm1 02, for the monobasic acids C Hm 04, and for the compound ethers CQ Hm 04, generated by the union of the two previous classes, is proved in the most general manner; so much so, indeed, that in many cases the determination of the boiling-point furnishes most material assistance in fixing the true character and position of a compound. And it deserves more especially to be noticed, that the simplest and most comprehensive relations have been recognized for those classes of organic compounds which have been longest known and most accurately investigated; and that even for those classes, the generality and simplicity of the relation, on account of numerous boiling-points incorrectly observed at an earlier date, appeared in the commencement doubtful, and could be more fully acknowledged only after a considerable number of new determinations. Thus we are justified in hoping that in other classes also of compounds in which simple and comprehensive relations have not hitherto been traced, these relations will become perceptible as soon as the verification of the boiling-points of terms already known, and the examination of new terms, shall have laid a broader foundation for our conclusions.
