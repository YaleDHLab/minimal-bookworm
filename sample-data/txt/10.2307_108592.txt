[ 399 ] XVII. On the Enumeration of x-edra having Triedral Summits, and an (xI)-gonal Base. By the Rev. THOMAS P. KIRKMAN, M.A. Communicated by A. CAYLEY, F.R.S. Received June 13,-Read June 21, 1855. IT is easily proved that no x-edron has a face of more than x1 angles, and that, if it has an (x1)-gonal face, it has at least two triangular faces. The object of this paper is to determine the number of x-edra which have an (x1)-gonal face, and all their summits triedral, or, which is the same thing, the number of x-acra which have an (x1)-edral summit, and all their faces triangular. We may call the (x-1)-gonal face the base of the x-edron. All the faces will be collateral with that base, and k of them will be triangular faces. If we suppose those k triangles to become infinitely small, in any x-edron A, we have as the result an (x k)-edron B, having only triedral summits, none of whose triangular faces was a triangle of A. And it is evident that there is only one (x-k)-edron B from which A can be cut by sections that shall remove no edge entirely, and shall leave untouched no triangle of B. It is plain also that B cannot have more, but may have fewer, triangles than A; for if the vanishing of a triangle of A gave rise to two triangles in B, B, having two contiguous triangles, and all its summits triedral, would be a tetraedron. If now we suppose the triangular faces of B to vanish, of which there must at least be two, there will arise a polyedron C, having only triedral summits, and fewer faces than B. In like manner C is reduced by the vanishing of its triangles to a solid of still fewer faces, and, by this continual evanescence of triangular faces, we shall finally arrive, either at a tetraedron, or a pentaedron with two triangular faces. Hence it appears, that every x-edron having its base (x1)-gonal, and all its summits triedral, can be cut from one of these two simple solids, by reversing the above process, i. e. by cutting away k summits of the base of a polyedron B, having k-h triangular faces, so as to leave none of those k-h triangles untouched. And by this process no polyedron A can be twice generated. It is to be remembered that we are all through handling no polyedra but those whose summits are all triedral. The pentaediron on a 4-lateral base, has around that base the faces 3434. This I call a doubly reversible polyedron, as it exhibits in the faces about the base the series 34 repeated, and reads backwards and forwards the same. If we cut every base sum mit of the tetraedron, we obtain a heptaedron having around its hexagonal base the faces 353535. This I call a trebly reversible heptaedron. 3o2 409 REV. 1'. P. KIRKMAN ON A CLASS OF POLYEDRA. If we cut a summit of either triangle of the pentaedron, we obtain the system 35344 about the pentagonal base. This is a reversible hexaedron. By cutting the first triangle of this with the pentagon and the second with the adjoining quadrilateral, we obtain the system 4364354, which I call an irreversible octaedron; it does not read backwards and forwards the same. The double reversible 3434, by one section of its triangles, becomes 435435, a double irreversible, and by another, 436344, a reversible heptaedron. And the system 353535 gives, by cutting the triangles in one way, the irreversible 437346345, and, in another way, the trebly irreversible 436436436. These six varieties comprise all the polyedra that have only triedral summits. They are all irreversible, reversible, doubly irreversible, doubly reversible, trebly irreversible, or trebly reversible. For if any polyedron exhibited in the faces about the base the fourfold repetition of any period of m faces containing k triangles, the vanishing of the 4k triangles would give rise to a fourfold repetition of a period of m-k faces, which would contain kP triangles, k' being not more than k; and this system around the base would reduce, by the vanishing of the 4k' triangles in it, to a fourfold repetition of a period of M-k--k' faces; and we should obtain at last a base of 4(m-K) sides, admitting no further reduction by the vanishing of triangles, i. e. we should obtain a pyramid having a tetraedral summit; which is impossible. Problem.-An x-edron P being given on an x 1-gonal base, and having k triangular faces, it is required to determine how many (x+k+l)-edra can be cut from it by the removal of k+1 base summits, so that none of the k triangles shall remain untouched, and so that no (x+k+l)-edron shall be the reflected image of any other. First, let P have about its base a series of x faces which read differently both backwards and forwards from every face, i. e. let it be an irreversible x-edron. As no two contiguous faces about the base can be triangles, if x> 4 (for then there would be a tetraedral summit at least, at one extremity of their common side), k:(x-.I), and k+lo.x1. We are bound to cut each of the k triangles once, which can be done in 2k ways, giving 2k different irreversible arrangements of x+k-1 faces. Next we have to cut I of the remaining x 1-k angles about the. base of P. These may be any I out of xI-k, and this gives us 2'. ( 1+ 1 arrangements of our k+l sections. But these will not be all different arrangements. Any one of them will contain e cases of twice cut triangles of P, thus made into e pentagons, and consequently l-e triangles which are not cut from triangles. Let us suppose e=2, the case in which two pentagons are newly made, standing thus, ... c353de353f... Of these four triangles, two were introduced in the distribution of our k sections, REV. T. P. KIRKMAN ON A CLASS OF POLYEDRA. 401 and two others in that of the I sections, which mnay happen in 22 different ways. This arrangement, c353de353f, in which cdef are supposed not to be triangles, will then be found 22 times with every disposition of the remaining k-2 triangles first cut, and with every (1-2) sections of angles not in triangles, of which angles the number is x1 2k. We have therefore counted the completed arrangement ...c353de353f... in the number 2 Q ) 22'.2 (-2) times instead of 2k-2 (I)''I tim2es. 1-2? The same error has been made with every value of e>k, and e01, or e: the least of k and 1, and this with every set of e twice cut triangles that can be selected out of k. Hence there is an error made in excess, in 2k( ) of (2e1) .2k-e (x -e I e?1 for every value of e1F the least of k and 1; for, in supposing e twice cut triangles, we assume that el'.k, and that k+l-k<$e. The number required in the problem is thus proved to be k ( ax-k-1)11-) k-e (X1-2k) I-el1 kel-l for all positive values of e not greater than either k or 1: which was to be found. This function I shall denote by the symbol ii.(x, k, 1). It expresses the number of (x+k+l)-edra that can be made from any x-edron having an (xI)-gonal base and k triangular faces, of which no two are contiguous, by removing k+l of the summits about the base, so that no edge shall be entirely removed, and that no one of the k triangles shall remain untouched. Of course k+lcx1. Its values are ii(x, k, 0)=2k; ii(x, k, 1)==2k 1(2x 3k-2); ii~x 1,1)=2 (x 21-1 (x-3)t1-1 ; it(n Kt 2 _k*1( 3) (xa 4) k. (xc --12k)] 3.2 k-3 .k.

Then I(x, k){ii.(x, k, 1)}, part of I(x+k+l, k+l), is the whole number of (x+k+l)-edra that can be cut, from irreversible x-edra having k triangles, so as to have k+l triangles. Others can be cut to be also part of 402 REV. T. P. KIRKMAN ON A CLASS OF POLYEDRA. I(x+k+l, k+0), from other x-edra having k' triangles, by removing k'+l' summits about the base, none of the kP triangles being untouched, if k'+l'=k+l. Next let our subject of operation be an irreversible containing more than one period of faces about the base. If it be a doubly irreversible, the base will be 2x-gonal, as every face will be opposite to a similar one. We have then two periods each of x faces, and if we operate on one of these so as to remove angles, leaving no triangle in the period untouched, and then repeat the operation exactly in order in the other period, we shall obtain a doubly irreversible for our result. Let 1P(2x+1, 2k) be the whole number of doubly irreversible (2x+1)-edra on a 2x-gonal base, having 2k triangles. Then ii. (x+ 1, k, is the number of ways in which we can remove k?2 summits from one period, and therefore 12(2x+1, 2k)ii(x+1, k) part of 12(2x+1+2k+l, 2k+1), is the whole number of doubly irreversibles having 2k+1 triangles, and a (2x+2k+1)gonal base, that can be cut front all the 12(2x+1, 2k) polyedra before us. If I is not an even number, iix+ 1, k, 2 is to be considered nothing; for it is impossible to remove a fractional number of summits. We can cut also from these P. (2x+1, 2k) doubly irreversibles a number of singly irreversibles. If each of these doubly irieversibles were single, it would give rise to ii(2x+ 1, 2k, 1) singly irreversibles; but the double character of the subject of operation causes every method of removing 2k+ tangles, which is not alike in both periods of the subject, to appear twice in the number just written. That is, we are to subtract fromn this number all the doubly irreversibles that can be made, and take half the remainder, which is, after division, 1 ii(2x + I1, 2k~, 1) -ii x + 1, kn 2)} The second term of this is zero when I is odd. We obtain thus for the number of singly irreversibles that can be cut to have 2k+1 triangles firom all the 12(2x+ 1, 2k) under consideration, P.(2x+ 1, 2k).{ii(2x+1, 2k, 1)-ii1, kx,2)} a part of I(2x+ 1 +2k+l, 2k+1). Next let us consider the operations that can be effected on triply irreversible (3x+1)-edra having 3k triangles. Let their number be I'(3x+l, 3k). It is easily pr oved by a repetition of the preceding argument, that ii x+ 1, k, I is the number of triply irreversibles that can be cut from each of them, and that *{ii(3x+l1 3k, 1)-ii(x+17 k, 3 REV. T. P. KIRKMAN ON A CLASS OF POLYEDRA. 403 is that of the singly irreversibles, where the appearance of a fraction in the function ii, reduces it, as it always mnust, to zero. That is, we obtain I3(3x+1, 3k).it'(x+l k, 3), as 13.(3.v+3k+1+1, 3k+1), and 13(3x+ 1, 3k)i 8{ii(3x+ 1, 3k, 1)-i(i + l, k, as a portion of I(3x+3k+l+ 1, 3k+1). From an irreversible no reversible can be cut by this removing of summits; for as the summnits of triangles of a reversible cotrrespond in pairs, the arrangement of faces about the base will still be reversible, if all the triangles are supposed to vanish. Let us now operate on a reversible polyedron, whose faces about the base read backwards and forwards alike. There will be a certain period abc....klm reversed, in one of the three ways, abc.e.. klrnlk.... cb, abc.... klimmlk.... cb, or abc..-.klmmlk.... cba. There is in any of these what may be called an axis of reversion, which in the first passes through the faces a and m, in the second through a and between two mr's in the thirdl between two a's and between two rn's. It is evident that the number of triangles about the base of a reversible cannot be odd, unless the axis of l'eversion passes through a triangle; as all faces recur in order reversed, through which that axis does not pass; and the base must be (2x+ I)-gonal, if the axis passes through one face only. The third case, of an axis of reversion passing through no face, does not occur when all the summits are triedral. First let the base be even, and let the number of triangles be even also; we have to consider the operations practicable upon a (2x+ 1)-edron R reversible, with 2k triangles. Some (2x+ I +2k+l)-edra can be cut from it reversible, and some irreversible, by the removing of 2k+1 'summits of the base, leaving none of the 2k triangles untouched. A reversible so cut will have on either side of its axis of reversion half the 2k+1 added triangles, unless it passes through an added triangle, in which case it will have on either side -1(2k+l1) of thenm. Let 1=21'; then the number of possible operations on one side of the axis of reversion, which exhibits x summits, is ii(x, k, 11) ; each of which gives by repeating it backwards one of our reversible (2x+ 1+2k+21')-edra. As the axis does not pass through a summit, I cannot be odd, for the added triangles are all in pairs. If then R(2x+ 1, 2k) be the total number of reversible (2x+ 1)-edra having 2k triangles, we obtain R(2x+1, 2k).i(x, k,5 ), part of R(2x+I+2k+1, 2k+1). 404 REV. T. P. KIRKMAN ON A CLASS OF POLYEDRA. Now take the reversible (2x+ I)-edron R' having 2k+ 1 triangles; the axis of reversion passes through one of them. As this triangle cannot be untouched, it must be twice touched, so that we have only (2k+1+1-2) other sections to make, one half of these on the x1 summits on one side of the axis, neglecting the summit of the central triangle. The possible operations are ii/ k -2 or, if R(2x+ I, 2k+ 1) be the total number of revei'sible (2x+ 1 )-edra having 2k+ 1 triangles, we obtain R(2x+ 1, 2k+ l)ii (x, k, l)2 , part of R(2x+2+2k+l, 2k+ +l1). We take now a reversible R" having a (2x1)-gonal base, and 2k triangles. The axis of reversion passes through a summit and through a face, which we shall suppose to be not a triangle. It is not difficult to prove that it can be no triangle if 2x1 >3, all the summits being triedral. We have on either side of the axis 1(2x-2) summits, that in the axis being neglected, and half the 2k triangles. We have to distribute k+2 sections on these xI summits. The number of ways to do it is ./ I\ which requires I to be even; or if I be odd, we may cut the summit in the axis, and distribute k+2--sections on the x1 summits, giving ii x, k, 2 These operations reversed on the other side of the axis give us all the possible results. If then R(2x, 2k) be the total number of reversible 2x-edra having 2k triangles, we can cut from all these R(2av 2 k) f (xik, + ii (,X k,2)} (2x+2k+1)-edra reversible, having 2k+1 triangles. One of the terms in the second factor is always zero. The polyedra so cut are a portion of R(2x+2k+l, 2k+1). When k+l=a-1, all the angles about the base of the reversible with k triangles are cut, and the result is of necessity reversible. But if k+l<x-1, some of the results of k+l sections will be irreversible. The whole number of results, if we treated the n-edron R or R'or RI as irreversible, would be ii(n, k, 1), but these are not all different. They will all, except the reversible ones, have a different order on the two sides of the axis of reversion; and each irreversible will occur twice, the second time reverted by exchanging the arrangements of the two sides of the axis, so as to make a polyedron and its reflected image. As we are not to count these reflexions we have to REV. T. P. KIRKMAN ON A CLASS OF POLYEDRA. 405 subtract froni ii(n, k, 1) all the possible reversible results, and divide the remainder by two. That is, by what precedes, we obtain from R, R' and R" {1ii (2x + , 2 k, 1) -ii(Z A, k) It is to l)e understood in these formula~ that 2k l< 2x in the first, 2k+l]+l1<2x in the second, 2kJl < 2x.-1 in thle third(. If we multiply the first by R(2x+l, 2k), the second by R(2x+1, 2k+l), and the third by R(2x, 2k), we obtain the corresponding portions of I(22+I+2k+l 2k+lj I(2x+r2+2k+l, 2k+l1+l), and I(2x+2k+l, 2k+1). Let us next operate on a doubly reversible (4xtl)-edron, with 4k triangles All these are cut from the pentaedron 3434, and by the addition of an even number of triangles in each period. The operations by which doubly reversibles are cut from a doubly reversible are simply those whereby reversibles are cut fr om1 the reversible period of 2x summits, containing 2k trianggles, being in number I 1+l, k, 4)by what has preceded. Or, if R2(4x+1, 4k) be the number of (4x+1)-edra doubly reversible, with 4k triangles, R2(4x+l, 4k) .ii.(~l k, L)=R2(4(x~k)+1?l, 4k+1), these being no more; for one of these latter can be cudt fro nothing but a doubly reversible with 4k~rl faces fewer. Ftoan the sampe (4x+r)-edra can be cut doubly irreversibles, namely so many as the irreversibles producible from sen one pe or from tea reversible (2x+li)-edron witht 2k triangles. Tnis number is, as just proved, l-{t(2Z+1, 2k, 1)-..ii(x+ 1,Z Ok)}, which multiplied by R2.(4x+ 1, 4k), constitutes a portion of 12.(4x+4kl+ , 4k+d1). As a doubly reversible is also a reversible, reversibles can be cut from it. It is to be observed that, as a reversible, it has two axes of reversion, as indeed every 2m-ly reversible has. Trhus the enneaedron 35363536 has an axis through the two poentagons and another through the hexagons. If we operate on one side of thue axis for irreversible results, and rfeert our operations on the other side, we obtain reversibles. The number of such results in either position of the axis of reversion is that of the irreversibles producible by (2k+o) sections of a 'eversible (2x+l)-gon with 2k MDCCCLvI.3 406 REV. T. P. KIRKMAN ON A CLASS OF POLYEDRA. triangles, or 12 {ii 2x+ 1, 2k) 2)-ii x+ 1, k, ) whence we obtain, from both positions of the axis, R2 1.(4x , 4k). .ii(2x+1, 2k, 2) -iit +1, k, 5 as part of 11(4x+1+4k+1, 4k+1). If we forget for a moment the character of one of -these R2(4m+ 1, 4k), and treat it as an irreversible, we obtain by 4k+1 sections ii(4m.+1, 4k, 1) results-. Of these the doubly reversibles can occur only once, every doubly-irreversible will occur twice, in one result as the reflexion of the other; every reversible will occur twice, the operations in the first period in the second result being' those of the second period in the first and every irreversible will occur four times, twice by the exchange of the operations on the first period for those on the second, and twice again by the reversion of all the operations, producing reflected images of two precedig results. That iS, if we subtract firom ii(4x+1, 4k, 1) all the doubly reversibles, twice the reversibles, and twice the doubly reversibles that can be cut from a doubly reversible (4x+ I)-gon having 4k triangles, by 4k+1 sections, there renmains four times the number of irreversibles that can be cut from it, by 4k+1 sec:tions. This remainder, divided by 4, is i2(4x+1, 4k, 1)-ii(X+I, k; -2 i(2x+ , 2k, 2) x+ I k, ) -it 2x+ 1, 2k, 21-ii x+ 1 kn 4)} =4ii(4x+l, 4k', lj+2ii x+l, k, 4)3ii 2x+ 1 2kn -) which, multiplied by R2(4xj 1, 4k), is to be added to 1(4x+ + +4k+i,3 4k+1). It remains that we handle now trebly reversible (6x+ 1)-ed ra, having 6k triangles. If X> 1, the number of triangles in a triply reversible cannot be less than 6k, as they are all cut from the heptiedion 15353139 by an even number of sections in every period. By operating on one reversible period of 2x su mnmits and 2k triangles for reversildes by -(6k+31) sections, we obtain all the triply reversibles. The number of these so found is ii.(x+1, k, 1), giving so many (6x+1+6k+-31)-e(ra triply reversible with 6k+31 triangles, for each subject; and 'in all R3(6x+1, 6k)(ii (x+1, k, k =R3(6k+1+6k+31, 6k+31). The numlber of triply irreversibles is equal to thlat of thte irireversibles producibule REV. T. P. KIRKMAN ON A CLASS OF POLYEDRA. 407 from a reversible period of 2x summits and 2k triangles by 1(6k+31) sections, and is, by what precedes, lii(2x+l, 2k, 1)-ii X+15 k 2} from each subject of operation. This, multiplied by R'(6x+ 1, 6k), is to be added to I3(6x+ 1+6k31, 6k+31). The reversibles obtainable from a triply irreversible are found only about one axis of reversion. Thus 735373537353 has only one axis through a heptagon and a pentagon. We are to cut by 1(6k+21) sections on one side of this axis all possible irreversibles from a reversible system of 3x summits and 3k triangles. These results reverted on the other side of the axis, will give all possible reversibles. Among these will be all triply reversible (6x+ 1 +6k+21)-edra, with 6k+21 triangles, for these are all reversible; and none of these can occur more than once. We have these to subtract from our results, leaving ii(3x+ I1, 3k, 1) -ii X+ 1, k, -) reversibles from every subject; which number, multiplied by R3(6x+l, 6k), forms part of R(6x+1+6k+21, 6k+21). If we treated a triply reversible as an irreversible by 6k+1 sections, we should obtain ii(6x+ 1, 6k, 1) results. Among these every triply reversible is found once; every triply irreversible twice, one place showing the reflected image of the other; every reversible three times, each time the same operations commencing at a different period; and every irreversible six times, being begun both backwards and forwards in three different periods. If then we subtract fromn ii(6x+ 1, 6k, 1) every triply reversible, twice the triply irrevisibles, and thrice the reversibles that can be made by 6k+1 sections of a triply reversible (6x+ I )-edron having 6k triangles, there will remain six times the number of irreversibles that can be so cut from the same. This remainder, after division by 6, is {ii(6xr l, 6kn 1-t(+ l5, k, 6iz 2x+ 1, 2k) )+tii + 1, k,) -3i~i 3x+ 1, 3k) )+3ii x+ I) k, ) =6ii(6x~rl, 6k, 1)+3,ii + 1, kj, 6)ii2x+], 2k, -3)ii 3X+1, 3k, ) which, multiplied by R3(6x+ 1, 6k), forms part of I(6x+ 1 6k+1, 6k+1). It is most convenient to treat the case of the triply reversible having only three triangles by itself. From this heptaedron can be cut one triply reversible by cutting every summit of the base. One triply irreversible only can be made, a decaedron, by cutting each triangle once. Two reversibles can be cut, by four sections, 3H2 408 REV. T. P. KIRKMAN ON A CLASS OF POLYEDRA. differing in the manner of cutting the triangle through which the axis of reversion (loes not pass, giving two reversible 1 I-edra. Three irreversibles can be cut from it, one by three, another by four, a third by five sections, as is evident on a moment's consideration, giving a 10-edron, 11-edron, and 12-edron. We can now collect into one group all the formulae above deduced, which contain the complete solution of our problem,; to find the number of these x-edra on an (x1)-gonal base.

To show the use of these equations, we can easily by trial verify the following: R3(4, 3)=1, R2(5, 2)=1, R(6, 2) =1, R(7, 2) =1, R3(7, 3)=1, 12(7, 2) =1, R(8, 2) =2, 1(8, 2) = 1, I(8, 3) =1, R(9, 3) =2, R(9, 2) =2, R2(9, 4) = 1, 1(9, 3) =3, 1(9, 2) =2, I2(9, 2) =2 then to find the decaedra on a 9-gonal base, with only triedral summits, we first write down the classes, R(10, 2)-R(8, 2).RR(8, 2, 0); I(10, 2) =R(8, 2).IR(8, 2, 0)+I(8, 2).I1(8, 2, 0) 1(10, 3) =R(7, 3).1R (7, 3, 0)+R(7, 2).IR(7, 2, l)+12(7, 2).112(7, 2, 1); I3(10 3)-R3(7, 3).I3R3(7, 3, 0); R(10, 4)-R(6, 2).RR(6, 2, 2); 1(10, 4) =R(6, 2).IR(6, 2, 2).

The dodecaedra are found by rather less calculation than the lhendecaedra, forming only eight classes, as follows: I( 12, 5)= R2(7, 3). IJR3(7, 3, 2) + 12(7, 2). 112(7, 2, 3) + R(75 2). IR(7, 2, 3), R(12, 5)= R(7, 2)RR(7, 2, 3)+R3(7, 3).RR3(7, 3, 2), 1(12, 4) = 1(8, 3)11(8, 3, 1)+I(8, 2). 11(8, 2, 2)+R(S, 2). IR(8, 2 2), R(I2, 4) = R(8, 2). 1R(8, 2, 2), 1(12,3) =I(9,3).II(9,3,0)+1(9,2)11(9,2,1)+R(9,3).IR(9,3,0)+R(9,2).IR(9,2,1), R(12, 3)=R(9, 3). LR(9, 3, 0) +R(9, 2) RR(9, 2, 1), 1(12,2) =1(10Q2)1I(10,2, 0)+R(10, 2).IR(10,2,0), R(12, 2) =R(10, 2). RR(10, 2, 0). These are, by what precedes all given numbers; and, by continuing the process, we can finally obtain all the x-edra on an (x1)gonal base, numbered in their proper classes, which have only triedral summits. I have generalized the expressions Inm(x,, k, 1), Rf (x,, k, 1), InRm(x, k, 1), which the theory requires for enumerating all the x-edra having an (xI)-gonal base, and any surninits hwhatever; but the fortnulv are not worth producing. T1he number ot distinctions to be made is too great to be of any readv use. If the x-edra having .an (xI )-gonal base were classed and enumerated according to their summits, it would be possible to count all the (x+h)-edra on the samne (xI)-gonal base, by removing summits not in the base, thus producing crown-faces, and by the vanishing of edges about the crowns and base, th us producing faces contiguous, but not collateral. TI1hat is, it would be possible to enumerate and classify the N-edra.
