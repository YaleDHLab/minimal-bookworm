[ 101 ] VI. A Second Mffemoir upon Quantics. By ARTHUR CAYLEY, Esq. Received April 14,-Read May 24, 1855. THE present memoir is intended as a continuation of my Introductory Memoir upon Quantics, t. 144. (1854) p. 245, and must be read in connexion with it; the paragraphs of the two Memoirs are numbered continuously. The special subject of the present memoir is the theorem referred to in the Postscript to the Introductory Memoir, and the various developments arising thereout in relation to the number and form of the covariants of a binary quantic. 25. 1 have already spoken of asyzygetic covariants and invariants, and I shall have occasion to speak of irreducible covariants and invariants. Considering in general a function u determined like a covariant or invariant by means of a system of partial differential equations, it will be convenient to explain what is meant by an asyzygetic integral and by an irreducible integral. Attending for greater simplicity only to a single set (a, b, c...), which in the case of the covariants or invariants of a single function will be as before the coefficients or elements of the function, it is assumed that the system admits of integrals of the form u-P. u,=Q, &c., or as we may express it, of integrals P, Q, &c., where P, Q, &c. are rational and integral homogeneous functions of the set (a, b, c..), and moreover that the system is such that P, Q, &C. being integrals, p(P, Q..) is also an integral. rhen considering only the integrals which are rational and integral homogeneous functions of the set (a, b, c..), integrals P, Q, R,.. not connected by any linear equation or syzygy (such as XP+PQ+vR..=o*), are said to be asyzygetic; but in speaking of the asyzygetic integrals of a particular degree, it is implied that the integrals are a system such that every other integral of the same degree can be expressed as a linear function (such as xP+PQ+vR..) of these integrals; and any integral P not expressible as a rational and integral homogeneous function of integrals of inferior degrees is said to be an irreducible integral. 26. Suppose now that AA2, A3, &c. denote the number of asyzygetic integrals of the degrees 1, 2, 3, &c. respectively, and let a,, B,, %,&c. be determined by the equations Al--?l A2 %I (o,+ 1) +M2 A3=6c~~c~+I )Qz1l+2) +M10?2+t?3 A4=24 M1(Ml + 1) (al+ 2 ) (a,+ 3 )+ 2 &1,( ol+ 1 )&o2 +alga3+ 2 o2S(&S+ 1 ) +&o4 &c., * It is hardly necessary to remark, that the multipliers A, A, v.., and generally any coefficients or quantities not expressly stated to contain the set (a) 6, c..), are considered as independent of the set, or to use a convenient word, are considered as ' trivrials.' MDCCCLVI. p 102 MR. A. CAYLEY S SECOND MEMOIR UPON QUANTICS. or what is the same thing, suppose that I +A1x+A2x2+ &c.= (1 -x)-0(1 _X2) '2((I _X3) 3. A little consideration will show that a., represents the number of irreducible integrals of the degree r less the number of linear relations or syzygies between the composite or non-irreducible integrals of the same degree. In fact the asyzygetic integrals of the degree 1 are necessarily irreducible, i. e. Al=a,. Represent for a moment the irreducible integrals of the degree 1 by X, X', &c., then the composite integrals X2, XX', &c., the number of which is Ial+ 1), must be included among the asyzygetic integrals of the degree 2; and if the composite integrals in question were asyzygetic, there would remain A2-2 oi(Al+ 1) for the number of irreducible integrals of the degree 2; but if there exist syzygies between the composite integrals in question, the number to be subtracted from A2 will be -ca1(a1+1) less the number of these 1~~~~ syzygies, and we shall have AS-a, (a,+ I), i. e. M2 equal to the number of the irreducible integrals of the degree 2 less the number of syzygies between the composite integrals of the same degree. Again, suppose that aC2 is negative -132, we may for simplicity ouppose that there areno irreducible integrals of the degree 2, but that the composite integrals of this degree, X2, XX', &c., are connected by 12 syzygies, such as )X2+CXX'+ &c. 0, X1X'+p~,XX'+ &c. =0. The asyzygetic integrals of the degree 4 include X ', &c., the number of which is (ol+ 1 )(,I+2)(1,+3); but these composite integrals are not asyzygetic, they are connected by syzygies which are augmentatives of the 2 syzygies of the second degree, viz. by syzygies such as (2iX2+(XXI..)X2=0, ( JX2+CXX'..)XX'=O &C. (x1X2+p1XX'..)X2=0, (XX2+JIXX'..)XX'=O, &C., the number of which is 21(,+1)P2. And these syzygies are themselves not asyzygetic, they are connected by secondary syzygies such as k(XX2+pcXX'..)X2+p1(XX2+(hXX'..)XX'+&c. _X(,,kX2+y,lXX . .)X2_pJ(XIX2 + cJXX . .)XX'_&c.=_O. &c. &C., the number of which is 212(02-1). The real number of syzygies between the composite integrals X4, X3X', &C. (i. e. of the syzygies arising out of the /2 syzygies between X2, XX', &c.), is therefore 2osl(a,+ 1)132-2(2(12-1), and the number of integrals of the degree 4, arising out of the integrals and syzygies of the degrees 1 and 2 respectively, is therefore -I ~18~ 9{ 2_~1\ _ n_\ MR. A. CAYLEY'S SECOND MEMOIR UPON QUANTICS. 103 or writing -a2 instead of P2, the number in question is Ial1 (?a, + 1) (tzs+ 2) (?al + 3) +IV4l(oVl+ 1 )o2+1oc2(a2+ 1 3. The integrals of the degrees 1 and 3 give rise to vc1?, integrals of the degree 4; and if all the composite integrals obtained as above were asyzygetic, we should have li-4 osl (Vs1 + 1 ) (asl + 2) (al + 3) Ca, (on, + 1) V62 2 0?(V2 + 1)-s'Ia z. e. ac4 as the number of irreducible integrals of the degree 4; but if there exist any further syzygies between the composite integrals, then a, will be the number of the irreducible integrals of the degree 4 less the number of such further syzygies, and the like reasoning is in all cases applicable. 27. It maybe remarked, that for any given partial differential equation, or system of such equations, there will be always a finite number Y such that given v independent integrals every other integral is a function (in general an irrational function only expressible as the root of an equation) of the v independent integrals; and if to these integrals we join a single other integral not a rational function of the v integrals, it is easy to see that every other integral will be a rational function of the v+ 1 integrals; but every such other integral will not in general be a rational and integral function of the v+ I integrals; and there is not in general any finite number whatever of integrals, such that every other integral is a rational and integral function of these integrals, i. e. the number of irreducible integrals is in general infinite; and it would seem that this is in fact the case in the theory of covariants. 28. In the case of the covariants, or the invariants of a binary quantic, A2 is given (this will appear in the sequel) as the coefficient of Xn in the development, in ascending powers of x, of a rational fraction fi where f is of the form fx' (_1X)O(I 1 Z2)0* * (I 1X k )O and the degree of px is less than that offx. We have therefore 1+Alx+A2x2+ ..=fX and consequently pX (1 z)O-1( x2)02-o2.. (I Xk)k-ak( xk+il)-ak+l.. Now every rational factor of a binomial I -xm is the irreducible factor of I -xm', where m' is equal to or a submultiple of m. Hence in order that the series a, a,, 253. may terminate, (px must be made up of factors each of which is the irreducible factor of a binomial 1 -m, or if px be itself irreducible, then Ax miust be the irreducible factor of a binomial 1 xm. Conversely, if px be not of the form in question, the series ez , M) , &c. will go on ad infinitum, and it is easy to see that there is no point in the series such that the terms beyond that point are all of them negative, i. e. there will be irreducible covariants or invariants of indefinitely high degrees; and the 104 MR. A. CAYLEY'S SECOND MEMOIR UPON QUANTICS. number of covariants or invariants will be infinite. The number of invariants is first infinite in the case of a quantic of the seventh order, or septic the number of covariants is first infinite in the case of a quantic of the fifth order, or quintic. 29. Resuming the theory of binary quantics, I consider the quantic (a, b, .. PB, d'(x, y)qn Here writing {fyx} =abb+2b-C.. +mba' =X =ZY}mbbamI Cbb +aX6b% Yn any function which is reduced to zero by each of the operations X.-yb, Y-x6, is a covariant of the quantic. But a covariant will always be considered as a rational and integral function separately homogeneous in regard to the facients (x, y) and to the coefficients (a, b, .. b, a'). And the words order and degree will be taken to refer to the facients and to the coefficients respectively. I commence by proving the theorem enunciated, No. 23. It follows at once from the definition, that the covariant is reduced to zero by the operation x -Yb X. Y b y Y Say. x ya $, which is equivalent to X.Y-Y.X+yay-xa. Now X.Y=XY+X(Y) Y. X=YX+Y(X), where XY and YX are equivalent operations, and X(Y) = 1 ma6a+ J 2m I bab... + m I Vb ab Y(X) = ml b^b.. +2m-1% ab'+1mna'b whence X (Y)-Y(X) =mabJ+m-2bb,. .-m-2b"b'b manat, =k suppose, and the covariant is therefore reduced to zero by the operation k+Ab -xx Now as regards a term aV..bP'd'.xiy , we have k=mez+m-2P.., -m-2i'-mo ,y'6tbx=j-i; and we see at once that for each term of the covariant we must have moc+m-2P. .-m 2'-ma'+j-i=O, z. e. if (x, y) are considered as being of the weights 2, -4 respectively, and (a, b, . . b, a) as being of the weights n,-4 m+ 1, . 2rm-I, m M respectively, then the weight of-each terma of the covariant is zero. MR. A. CAYLEY'S SECOND MEMOIR UPON QUANTICS. 105 But if (x,.y) are considered as being of the weights 1, 0 respectively, and (a, b, ..b', a') as being of the weights 0, I ..m1, m respectively, then writing the equation under the form m(a + P. . +f3'+ a') +j+i 2(i3+2 . . +m1-3' +moMa + i) =0 and supposing that the covariant is of the order p and of the degree 0, each term of the covariant will.be of the weight , (mO+p). I shall in the sequel consider the weight as reckoned in the last-mentioned manner. It is convenient to remark, that as regards any function of the coefficients of the degree 0 and of the weight q, we have X.Y-Y.X=mO-2q. 30. Consider now a covariant (A, B, ..B', A' Tx, y) of the order p and of the degree 0; the covariant is reduced to zero by each of the operations X -yb, Y-xn6, and we are thus led to the systems of equations XA =0 XB =(tA XC =p-1B XB' 2C' XA'A=B' and YA =B YB 2C YC' i-iB' YB' =pA' YA' =O. Conversely if these equations are satisfied the function will be a covariant. I assume that A is a function of the degree 0 and of the weight (my-A), satisfying the condition XA=O. And I represent by YA, Y2A, Y3A, &c. the results obtained by successive operations with Y upon the function A. The function V'A will be of the degree 0 and of the weight 2 (md-p)+s. And it is clear that in the series of terms YA, Y2A, Y3A, &c., we must at last come to a term which is equal to zero. In fact, since m is the greatest weight of any coefficient, the weight of V' is at most equal to mdO and therefore if d (my-A) +s>m0, or s>2 (m0+,), we must have YIA=0. 106 MR. A. CAYLEY'S SECOND MEMOIR UPON QUANTICS. Now writing for greater simplicity XY instead of X.Y, and so in similar cases, we have, as regards YVA, XY-YX=p-2s. Hence (XYYX)A=-A, and consequently XYA=YXA+F4A=pA. Similarly (XY-YX)YA= p YA, and therefore XY2A= YXYA +h 2YA =pYA+(j-2YA=2(pj1)YA, And again, (XY-YX)Y2A=-p-4Y2A and therefore XY3A= YXy2A+ 4Y2A =2p1Y2A+p-4Y2A 3(p -2)Y2A, or generally XY'AA=s(p.-s+ 1)Y8A. Hence putting s=P+1, p+2, &c., we have XY"+'A=o XYg+2A = (p +2) 1. JY+A XY' +'A(p+3)2.Y' A &c., equations which show that for unless this be so, i. e. if Y"+1A=1=o, then from the second equation XY"+'A=-lo,3 and therefore Y'x2Azi=O, from the third equation XYh'=H=O, and therefore Y~'3A=i0o, and so on ad inftnitum, i. e.' we must have Y*+'A=O. 3 1. The suppositions which have been made as to the function A, give therefore the equations XA=O XYA=cA XY2A =2(pi1)YA XYFA=pY-lA Yg+'A=o. And if we now assume B=YA, C=IYB, 1YB1, MR. A. CAYLEY'S SECOND MEMOIR UPON QUANTICS. 107 the system becomes XA =_0 XB =pA XC =(-1B XA'=B' YA'=H; so that the entire system of equations which express that (A, B..,B', A'Jx, y)is a covariant is satisfied; hence Theorem. Given a quantic (a, 4 . . b', a's(x, y)m; if A be a function of the coefficients of the degree d and of the weight 2 (mO-p) satisfying the condition XA=, and if B, C, . .B', A' are determined by the equations B=YA, C=-YB, ..AX=YB', then will (A, B, ..B', A'NX, Y be a covariant. In particular, a function A of the degree a and of the weight X md, satisfying the condition XA=O, will (also satisfy the equation YA=O and will) be an invariant. 32. 1 take now for A the most general function of the coefficients, of the degree d and of the weight v. (my A); then XA is a function of the degree 0 and of the weight 3 (m p-)1, and the arbitrary coefficients in the function A are to be determined so that XA=O. The number of arbitrary coefficients is equal to the number of terms in A, and the number of the equations to be satisfied is equal to the number of terms in XA; hence the number of the arbitrary coefficients which remains indeterminate is equal to the number of terms in A less the number of terms in XA; and since the covariant is completely determined when the leading coefficient is known, the difference in question is equal to the number of the asyzygetic covariants, i. e. the number of the asyzygetic covariants of the order A and the degree 0 is equal to the number of terms of the degree 0 and weight 2. (my-p), less the number of terms of the degree d and weight 1 (md-p) -1. 33. I shall now give some instances of the calculation of covariants by the method just explained. It is very convenient for this purpose to commence by forming the literal parts by ARBOGAST'S Method of Derivations: we thus form tables such as the following:a 1 c f ad ab ac be 62 108 MR. A. CAYLEY'S SECOND MEMOIR UPON QUANTICS. a b c d i a2 ab ac ad | cd | d2 1 ~~~~62 bc e2 a3 a2b a2c a2d abd acd ad2 bd -cd2 d' ab abc ac2 b2d bcd c2 d 63 b2c bc2 C3 a4 aab a3c a3d a2bd a2cd a2d2 abd2 acd2 ad3 bdcd' ' |2b2 a2bc a2c2 ab2d abed ac2d b2d2' bed c2d2 ab3 ab2C abc2 ac3 b 2cd bc2d c'd { b4 1 ~~~~ ~ ~ ~~~b2c2 ja V 63cd eI C 2~~~~~~~~66 a2 ab ac ad ae be bd cd a b2 bc bd cd c2 a3 a2b a2c a2d a2e abe ace ade ae2 be2 ce | de2 en ab2 abc abd acd ad2 bee bde cde d2e b3 ac2 b2d b2e 6bd c2e d3 ab2 S b2c bc2 bed c2d c 2 34. Thus in the case of a cubic (a, b, c, d3Cx, y)3, the tables show that there will be a single invariant of the degree 4. Represent this bv Aa2d2 +Babcd + Cac' +Db3d +Eb2c2, which is to be operated upon with .a)b+2bC+3cad. This gives t +B | | +6A a2cd +3D +2B ab2d | + 2E | +6C0 + 3B abc2 + 4E + 3D b'c MR. A. CAYLEY'S SECOND MEMOIR UPON QUANTICS. 109 i.e. B+6A=0, 3D+2B=O, &c.; or putting A=i, we find B=6, C=43 D=4, E= -3, and the invariant is a2d2 -6abcd +4ac3 + 4b3d 3b2c. Again, there is a covariant of the order 3 and the degree 3. The coefficient of xs or leading coefficient is Aa2d +Babc +Cb 3 which operated upon with aa+2b6,+3cad, gives + B + 3A a 2C +30 +2B a62 i. e. B+3A=0, 3C+2B=0; or putting.A=1, we have B=-3, C=2, and the"leading coefficient is a2d -3abc +2b'3. The coefficient of x2y is found by operating upon this with (3bba+2cb+d3c), this gives +6 -3 abd -6 ae2 -9 +12 6ec i. e. the required coefficient of x2y is 3abd -6a&2 -+3b 2C and by operating upon this with 2 (3bba+2cab+dae) , we have for the coefficient of ,ry2' +3 -6 aed + 92 + 2 d -9 +6 be' i. e. the coefficient of Xy2 is -3acd +6b2d -.-3bc2. MDCCCLVI. Q 110 MR. A. CAYLEY'S SECOND MEMOIR UPON QUANTICS. Finally, operating upon this with 1 (3ba,+2c66+dc)) we have for the coefficient of y _3 + | Jbed i. e. the coefficient of y3 is -ads +3bcd 2C , and the covariant is a'd I 3abd -3acd -ad2 ( -jab -6ac ? + 362d + 3bed + Q63 + 3b2C -31c 3c I have worked out the example in detail as a specimen of the most convenient method for the actual calculation of more complicated covariants *. 35. The number of terms of the degree 0 and of the weight q is obviously equal to the number of ways in which q can be made up as a sum of 0 terms with the elements (0, 1, 2, . . M), a number which is equal to the coefficient of xzl in the development of and the number of.the asyzygetic covariants of any particular degree for the quantic * Note added Feb. 7, 1856.-The following method for the calculation of an invariant or of the leading coefficient of a covariant, is easily seen to be identical in principle with that given in the text. Write down all the terms of the weight next inferior to that of the invariant or leading coefficient, and operate on each of these separately with the symbol b cb 6 ind. b +2 ind. c c b +m-1 ind. b'where we are first to multiply by the fraction, rejecting negative powers, and then by the index of the proper letter in the term so obtained. Equating the results to zero, we obtain equations between the terms of the invariant or leading coefficient, and replacing in these equations each term by its numerical coefficient in the invariant or leading coefficient, we have the equations of -connexion of these numerical coefficients. Thus, for the discriminant of a cubic, the terms of the next inferior weight are a'cd, ab2d, abc', b'c, and operating on each of these separately with the symbol 6 c ~~~~d ind. b -+2 ind. c ' + 3 ind. do d. -a 6 c we find abcd + 6 a2d2 3 b3d +2 abed 2 bY' +6 ac3 +3 abed +4 b'c' +3 b'd and equating the horizontal lines to zero, and assuming a'd'= 1, we have a2d2= 1, abed= -6, ac =4, b3d=4, bc'= -3, or the value of the discriminant is that given in the text. MR. A. CAYLEY'S SECOND MEMOIR UPON QUANTICS. il (*Xx, y)m can therefore be determined by means of this development. In the case of a cubic, for example, the function to be developed is (J-Z(I XZ) I ___)j_ which is equal to I+z(1+x2+x3) +z'2(l+x+2x2+2x3+2x,+xl5+x6)+ &c., where the coefficients are given by the following table; on account of the symmetry, the series of coefficients for each power of z is continued only to the middle term or middle of the series. 1 (0) 1 J I (1) 1 1 21 2 f (2) 1' 1.121313 (3) 1 2 13 4 4 5 (4) 111l1 2 13 1 4 156 6j (5) 1K 2 3 4 5 7 1 8 1 (6), and from this, by subtracting from each coefficient the coefficient which immediately precedes it, we form the table IIl (0) 1 1 0 (1) 1 0 1 0 (2) 1 0 1 1 0 (3) 1f 1 1 1 111 (4) 1 if 1 j II 0 (5) 1 0 1 1 11112 0 1 0 (6) The successive lines fix the numbert and character of the covariants of the degrees 0, 1, 2, 3, &c. The line (0), if this were to be interpreted, would show that there is a single covariant of the degree 0; this covariant is of course merely the absolute con"-stanlt unity, and may be excluded. The line (1) shows that there is a single cov7ariant Q 2 112 MR. A. CAYLEY'S SECOND MEMOIR UPON QUANTICS. of the degree 1, viz. a covariant of the order 3; this is the cubic itself, which I represent by U. The line (2) shows that there are two asyzygetic covariants of the degree 2, viz. one of the order 6, this is merely U2, and one of the order 2, this I represent by H. The line (3) shows that there are three asyzygetic covariants of the degree 3, viz. one of the order 9, this is U3; one of the order 5, this is UH, and one of the order 3, this I represent by (D. The line (4) shows that there are five asyzygetic covariants of the degree 4, viz. one of the order 12, this is U4; one of the order 8, this is U2H; one of the order 6, this is H2; and one of the order 0, i. e. an invariant, this I represent by v. The line (5) shows that there are six asyzygetic covariants of the degree 5, viz. one of the order 15, this is U'; one of the order I1, this is U3H; one of the order 9, this is Uk2P; one of the order 7, this is UH2; one of the order 5, this is HI-t; and one of the order 3, this is VU. The line (6) shows that there are 8 asyzygetic covariants of the degree 6, viz. one of the order 18, this is U6; one of the order 14, this is U4H; one of the order 12, this is Uk(P; one of the order 10, this is U2'1I2; one of the order 8, this is UH(T; two of the order 6 (i. e. the three covariants H3, '2 and VU' are not asyzygetic, but are connected by a single linear equation or syzygv), and one of the order 2, this is VH. We are thus led to the irreducible covariants U, H, (D V connected by a linear equation or syzygy between H3, F(D2 and VU2, and this is in fact the complete system of irreducible covariants; V is therefore the only invariant. 36. The asyzygetic covariants are of the form UPHfVr, or else of the form U2'U'V"( and since U, H, V are of the degrees 1, 2, 4 respectively, and (Di is of the degree 3, the number of asyzygetic covariants of the degree m of the first form is equal to the coefficient of xd in 1-+(1 )(1-x2)(1-x4), and the number of the asyzygetic covariants of the degree m of the second form is equal to the coefficient of x"n in 3.(1 -X)(l -X2)(1 -x4). Hence the total number of asyzygetic covariants is equal to the coefficient of xm in (1+x3) (1 X)(IX2)(1-X4), or what is the same thing, in 1 -X6 (1-X)(1-X2)(1-X3)(1-.x4) and conversely, if this expression for the number of the asyzygetic covariants of the degree rn were established independently, it would follow that the irreducible invariants were four in number, and of the degrees 1, 2, 3, 4 respectively, but connected by an equation of the degree 6. As regards the invariants, every invariant is of the form VP, i. e. the number of asyzygetic invariants of the degree m is equal to the coefficient of xm in 1 -X4) and conversely, from this expression it would follow that there was a single irreducible invariant of the degree 4. 37.

Trhe asyz ygetic covariants are of the form WFHWJ or else of the form UplqlrJsD, and the number of the asyzygetic covariants of the degree m is equal to the coefficient of xm in (1+x').(1-)(1-2)2(1-x3), or what is the same thing, in 1 _ 6 114 MR.

Conversely, if these formulae were established, the preceding results as to the form of the system of the irreducible covariants or of the irreducible invariants, would follow. 39. In the case of a quintic, the function to be developed is (1-Z)(1-XZ) (1-2Z) (1-X3Z) (1-X4Z)(1X5Z) and the coefficients are given by the table: 1 (0) 1 1I I 1 f (1) i1' 1 1 2 2 12 3 )31 (2) 1 1 2131 51616 (3) 11 1 2' 3 5 6 8 9 11i 11j12j (4) I1 1 2 3 5 17 911 14 16 18 19 201 (5) and subtracting from each coefficient the one which immediately precedes it, we have the table: I 1 g (0) I1 0 0 (1) )I 1 1 1 0 (2) I 0 1 1 1 1 1 0b (3) ji 0 1 1 211 2 1 120 j(4) I10 11 1 2 2 2 2 13 12 2 1 1 (5) We thus obtain the following irreducible covariants, viz.Of the degree 1 ; a single covariant of the order 5, this is the quintic itself. Of the degree 2; two covariants, viz. one of the order 6, and one of the order 2. Of the degree 3; three covariants, viz. one of the order 9, one of the order 5, and one of the order 3. Of the degree 4; three covariants, viz. one of the order 6, one of the order 4, and one of the order 0 (an invariant). Of the degree 5; three covariants, viz. one of the order 7; one of the order !3, and one of the order 1 (a linear covariant). MR. A. CAYLEY'S SECOND MEMOIR UPON QUANTICS. 115 And these covariants are connected by a single syzygy of the degree 5 and of the order 11; in fact, -the table shows that there are only two asyzygetic covariants of this degree and order; but we may, with the above-mentioned irreducible covariants of the degrees 1, 2, 3 and 4, form three covariants of the degree 5 and the order 11 there is therefore a syzygy of this degree and order. 40. I represent the number of ways in which q can be made up as a sum of m terms with the elements 0, 1, 2,... m, each element being repeatable an indefinite number of times by the notation P(0,1, 2, .. m)0q, and I write for shortness P'(O, 152,..m)0q=P(0, l,2..m)0q-P(0j, 1,2...m)0q-1. Then for a quantic of the order m, the number of asyzygetic covariants of the degree O and of the order K is P'(0, 1,2 ... In particular, the number of asyzygetic invariants of the degree 0 is PA(O 1, 2 . m)0 1 W. To find the total number of the asyzygetic covariants of the degree 0, suppose first that md is even; then, giving to p the successive values 0, 2, 4,..mO, the required number is P(Imd) P(1. 0 1) P(PmO1)-P(ImdO2) +P(2) -.P(i) +P(i) =Pawm), i. e. when md is even, the number of the asyzygetic covariants of the degree 0 is P(O, 1, 2.. m)0lmO; and similarly, when md is odd, the number of the asyzygetic covariants of the degree is P(O, I1, 2, ..m)? (mdI). But the two formulae may be united into a single formula; for when mO is odd rmad is a fraction, and therefore P(Imd) vanishes, and so when mO is even !(mO1) is a fraction, and P12(md1) vanishes; we have thus the theorem, that for a quantic of the order mi,The number of the asyzygetic covariants of the degree d is P(O, 1, 2 ... m)0-wmO+P(0, 1, 2, .. m)01(no1). 41. The functions PEm2, &c. may, by the method explained in my "Researches 116 ;MR. A.

Attending first to the invariants,42. For a quadric, the number of asyzygetic invariants of the degree 0 is 1 coefficient 0O in 1-_ 2 which leads to the conclusion that there is a single irreducible invariant of the degree 2. MR. A. CAYLEY'S SECOND MEMOIR UPON QUANTICS. 117 43. For a cubic, the number of asvzygetic invariants of the degree K is coefficient x9 in 1_X4 i. e. there is a single irreducible invariant of the degree 4. 44. For a quartic, the number of asyzygetic invariants of the degree 0 is coefficient x8 in (I-2) --3) i. e. there are two irreducible invariants of the degrees 2 and 3 respectively. 45. For a quintic, the number of asyzygetic invariants of the degree 0 is I _X6+x12 coefficient X? in (in X4)(jX6)(iT) The numerator is the irreducible factor of I-x36, i. e. it is equal to (1 X36)(1-x6) (1 -18)(1 -t2); and substituting this value, the number becomes coefficient xo in 1 _ w36 T. e. there are in all four irreducible invariants, which are of the degrees 4, 8, 12 and 18 respectively; but these are connected by an equation of the degree 36, i. e. the square of the invariant of the degree 18 is a rational and integral function of the other three invariants; a result, the discovery of which is due to M. HERMITE. 46. For a sextic, the number of asyzygetic invariants of the degree 0 is *(I *X (-(I +X-3_X4_5 X+7+X8). coefficient i in X(1-2)2(13)(1-x4)(1-x5) the second factor of the numerator is the irreducible factor of t-o30, i. e. it is equal to ( _)(I-x); andsubstitutingthis value, the number becomes coefficient x? in (i--2)(l-X4j(lS6)(IZ1?)(I-15) i. e. there are in all five irreducible invariants, which are of the degrees 2, 4, 6, 10 and 15 respectively; but these are connected by an equation of the degree 30, ie. the square of the invariant of the degree 15 is a rational and integral function of the other four invariants. 47. For a septic, the number of asyzygetic invariants of the degree 0 is 1 -x6+ 2x8-x'0+ 5x12+ 2x14+ 6x16+ 2x18 +5x20_-22+ 2x24-.x26+X32 coefficient x'i -i (1 -4) (1 6)(1 8)(11O0)(1x 12) the numerator is equal to ( X6) (I -XI*) -2( 1, XI'0) (I _Xr2) -5( _x -14) -4", where the series of factors does not terminate; hence the number of irreducible invaMDCCCLVI. 118 MR.

To verify this it is to be remarked, that there are 1, 4, 10 and 4 asyzygetic invariants of the degrees in question respectively; there is therefore one irreducible invariant of the degree 4; calling this X4) there is only one composite invariant of the degree 8, viz. X2; there are therefore three irreducible invariants of this degrees say X8, X8, X". The composite invariants of the degree 12 are four in number, viz. X3, X4X8, X4X8 X4X'8, and these cannot be connected by any syzygy, for if they were so, X2, X8, X'8, X'" would be connected by a syzygy, or there would be less than 3 irreducible invariants of the degree 8. Hence there are precisely 6 irreducible invariants of the degree 12. And since the irreducible invariants of the degrees 4, 8 and 12 do not give rise to any composite invariant of the degree 14, there are precisely 4 irreducible invariants of the degree 14. 48. For an octavic, the number of the asyzygetic invariants of the degree 0 is (1-X)(1 ?+aX3-X4+X6+X7+?8+w9+X10_-Xl2-X3+xl5+?X6) coefficient x in (1 -X2)2(1 -X3)2(1-x4) ( -X5)(1-X7) and the second factor of the numerator is (I )-I(l 2)(I -t'3)-'( -X 6)1-l(1 _X8)-l(j -9)-_I(l _X 10)-1( _Z16)1 _Z1-7)(1 _t18). where the series of factors does not terminate, hence the number of irreducible invariants is infinite. Substituting the preceding value, the number of the asyzygetic invariants of the degree 0 is coeffi xcin (1 -x')-'(1 -x4 )6)-'1 -7)-(1 )-'(-x')-(1( -x0)-'(X I'6)(1 X1I)(1 1).. There is certainly one, and only one irreducible invariant for each of the degrees 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 respectively; but the formula does not show the number of the irreducible invariants of the degrees 7, &c.; in fact, representing the irreducible invariants of the degrees 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 by X2, XI, X4, X5, X6 these give rise to 3 composite invariants of the degree 7, viz. X2X2X.3 X2X,, XX4, which may or may not be connected by a syzygy; if they are not connected by a syzygy, there will be a single irreducible invariant of the degree 7; but if they ate connected by a syzygy, there will be two irreducible invariants of the degree 7; it is useless at present to pursue the discussion further. Considering next the covariants,49. For a quadric, the number of asyzygetic covariants of the degree 0 is coefficient x0 in MR. A. CAYLEY'S SECOND MEMOIR UPON QUANTICS. 119 i. e. there are two irreducible covariants of the degrees 1 and 2 respectively; these are of course the quadric itself and the invariant. 50. For a cubic, the number of the asvzygetic covariants of the degree 0 is coefficient x0 in (1 _?x2)(1X) The first factor of the numerator is the irreducible factor of 1-x, =(1 x2)*. (1-x) and the second factor of the numerator is the irreducible factor of l Ad =(IX4) .(l-X). substituting these values, the number is coefficient xAit X(1 X(2) (1 -)(14)' z. e. there are 4 irreducible covariants of the degrees 1, 2, 3, 4 respectively; but these are connected by an equation of the degree 6; the covariant of the degree I is the cubic itself U, the other covariants are the covariants already spoken of and represented by the letters H, 'D and V respectively (H is of the degree 2 and the order 3, (D of the degree 3 and the order 3, and V is of the degree 4 and the order 0, i. e. it is an invariant). 51. For a quartic, the number of the asyzygetic covariants of the degree 0 is 1 -x~x2 coefficient xa in X)2 X2) X3)1 the numerator of which is the irreducible factor of 1 -x6, i. e. it is equal to (1-x6)(1-x) (1 -X2)(1 .X). Making this substitution, the number is coefficient xM in I _X6 i. e. there are five irreducible covariants, one of the degree 1, two of the degree 2, and two of the degree 3, but these are connected by an equation of the degree 6. The irreducible covariant of the degree 1 is of course the quartic itself U, the other irreducible covariants are those already spoken of and represented by I, H, J. ( respectively (I is of the degree 2 and the order 0, and J is of the degree 3 and the order 0, i. e. I and J are invariants, H is of the degree 2 and the order 4, (P is of the degree 3 and the order 6). 52.

Substituting the preceding values, the expression for the number of the asyzygetic covariants of the degree 0 is coeff. in (I X)-1(I X2)-2(1 _3)-( _Z4)-3(1 _X) -2(1 _6)4(1 x_7)'(-_ X8)6(1 x() I(I-x)(1 -x 1).19., which agrees with a previous result: the numbers of irreducible covariants for the degrees 1, 2, 3, 4 are 1, 2, 3 and 3 respectively, and for the degree 5, the number of irreducible covariants is three, but there is one syzygy between the composite covariants of the degree in question; the difference 31=2 is the index taken with its sign reversed of the factor (1 -X) 2. .53. 1 consider a system of the asyzygetic covariants of any particular degree and order of a given quantic, the system may of course be replaced by a svstem the terms of which are any linear functions of those of the original system, and it is necessary to inquire what. covariants ought to be selected as most proper to represent the system of asyzygetic covariants; the following considerations seem to me to furnish a convenient rule of selection. Let the literal parts of the terms which enter into the coefficients of the highest power of x or leading coefficients be represented by Max Ma, M,.. these quantities being arranged -in the natural or alphabetical order; the first in order of these quantities M. which enters into the leading coefficient of a particular covariant, may for shortness be called the leading term of such covariant, and a covariant the leading term of which is posterior in order to the leading term of another covariant, may be said to have a lower leading term. It is clear, that by properly determining the multipliers of the linear functions we may form a covariant the leading terni of which is lower than the leading term of any other covariant (the definition implies that there is but one such covariant); call this 0). We may in like manner form a covariant such that its leading term is lower than the leading term of every other covariant except 0, ; or rather we may form a system of such covariants, since if ('l be a covariant having the property in question PD2+kO, will have the same property, but k may be determined so that the covariant shall not contain the leading terni of 01, i. e. we may form a covariant 02 such that its leading term is lower than the leading term of every other covariant excepting 01, and that the leading term of 0, does not enter into 0)2; and there Is but one such covariant, 02. Again, we may form a covariant 03 such that its leading term is lower than the leading term of every other covariant excepting 0, and 02, and that the leading terms of 01 and 02 do not either of them enter into 03; and there is but one such covariant 03. And so on, until we arrive at a covariant the leading term of which is higher than the leading terms of the other covariants, and which does not contain the leading terms of the other covariants. We have thus a series of covariants 0,, 02, 03, &c. containing the proper number of terms, and which covariants may be taken to represent the asyzygetic covariants of the degree and order i n question. MR. A. CAYLEY'S SECOND MEMOIR UPON QUANTICS. 12-1 In order to render the covariants 0 definite as well numierically as in regard to sign, we may suppose that the covariant is in its least terms (i. e. we may reject numerical factors common to all the terms), and we may make the leading term positive. The leading term with the prover numerical coefficient, if different from unity and with the proper power of x, or the order of the function annexed, will, when the covariants of a quantic are tabulated, be sufficient to indicate, without any ambiguity whatever, the particular covariant referred to. I subjoin a table of the covariants of a quadric, a cubic and a quartic, and of the covariants of the degrees 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 respectively of a quintic, and also two other invariants of af quintic.

No. 13 is the quintic itself; No. 15 is the Hessian; No. 19 is the quartinvariant; No. 22 is the linear covariant; the other covariants can be referred to by their degree and order, or simply by the number of the table. The foregoing covariants are connected by the equation of the degree 5 and order I 11 .(No. 13)(No. 21)+(No. 14)(No. J8)-(No. 15)(No. 17)=0. The table No. 25 is the simplest octinvariant, and the table No. 26 is the discriminant; we have (No. 26)= (No. 19)2 _ 1152(No. 25).
