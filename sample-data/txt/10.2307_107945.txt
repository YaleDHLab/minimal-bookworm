[ 459 1 XXV. Experiments on the Length of the Seconds Pendulum at the Royal Observatory of Greenwich. By Captain EDWARD SABINE, of the Royal Regiment of Artillery, F.R.S. Read June 16, 1831. THESE experiments were made with the original convertible pendulum constructed by Captain KATER, and employed by him in 1817 in Portland Place, London. Prior to its employment in the present experiments I made the following alterations in the pendulum. 1. The tail pieces were removed altogether; coincidences being observed by the bar itself (the ends being blackened for the purpose), and by a disc of corresponding diameter on the pendulum of the clock. 2. The " moveable weight " employed by Captain KATER was dispensed with altogether; and the pendulum rendered convertible, within the limits of more exact adjustment by the slider, by filing away a small quantity of metal from one extremity of the bar. By this alteration there remained nothing moveable about the pendulum except the slider; and that was so placed in these experiments, that a change in its position, of so great magnitude as the tenth of an inch, did not occasion an alteration of so much as the tenth of a second in the daily rate of the pendulum, when suspended with the weight below, which is the position in which the rate is determined. The slider was clamped to the bar, and was moved by a screw for slow motion, by which it could be adjusted with tolerable precision to the hundredth of an inch. The graduation on the bar, by which the place of the slider was regulated, was on the side of the bar next the observer, who could thus at all times assure himself that no change occurred in its position by the inversion of the pendulum. Neither of these alterations interfered with the distance between the knife edges, which was referred in 1817 to Sir GEORGE SHUCKBURGH'S scale by Cap460 CAPTAIN SABINE ON THE LENGTH OF THE SECONDS PENDULUM tain KATER, and found to measure 39.44085 inches of that scale at the temperature of 62?. The experiments were made, unless where it is otherwise noticed, in the vacuum apparatus, established in the S.W. angle of the pendulum room in the Royal Observatory, being the place assigned for that apparatus by the Astronomer Royal. The thermometer, by which the temperature of the pendulum was observed, is the same which I have used and described on former occasions ; particularly in the Phil. Trans. for 1830, where its comparison is given with a standard thermometer of M. BESSEL's, at the same temperatures at which it was used in these experiments. In a paper on the construction and use of the vacuum apparatus, in the Phil. Trans. for 1829, I have shown that when the pressure of the air is withdrawn fiom, the exterior of the bulb of this thermometer, an index correction of + 00.75 is required to make its indications in a highly rarified medium correspond with its measure of the same temperatures when under the pressure of the atmosphere. This index correction is consequently applied whenever the air is withdrawn from the apparatus. The thermometer was inclosed with the pendulum within the glasses, with its bulb suspended midway between the knife edges. When the air is withdrawn from the apparatus, and the shutters of the apartment are kept closed (except when light is required for the observation of coincidences), a great uniformity as well as steadiness of temperature is maintained within the glasses. Whenever the indications of the barometer were required, a reference was made to the standard barometer of the observatory, which is stationed in an adjoining room on the same level. The scale by which the arcs of vibration were observed was graduated in degrees, each degree being the 0.833th of an inch. In maaking the observation, the division of the scale coinciding with one side of the bar was noticed at each extremity of the vibration, and the same repeated with the other side of the bar; a mean was then taken of the two included spaces, and half the mean registered as the arc on either side the vertical. The scale being placed in both positions of the pendulum 45.5 inches below the point of suspension, the registered arcs multiplied by 1.05 produce the true arcs of vibration; by employing these in the usual formula for that purpose, what is usually considered IN THE OBSERVATORY OF GREENWICH. 461 as the compensation for the arcs is obtained. During the progress of the experiments, however, I had occasion to suspect that, particularly when the pendulum was vibrated with the weight above, the retardation of the vibrations, in consequence of their being performed in circular arcs, was greater than the compensations computed by the customary formula N. sin (A + a). sin (A a) c32 M. (log. sin A-log. sin a)' To examine this more closely, and to obtain practically a just compensation for the arcs in which the pendulum had been vibrated in the course of its employment, I made several series of experiments distinct from those made to determine the rate, and which I shall proceed to describe in the first instance, though they were not the first in the order of time. Correction for the Arcs of Vibration. ? 1. Weight above. On the 27th of January 1830, I made the following observations, purposing to compare, under circumstances otherwise similar, the rate of the pendulum in different arcs; 1st, commencing with 10.32 and ending with 00.73; 2nd, commencing with 0?.70 and ending with 00.42; and 3rd, commencing with 0?.42 and ending with 0?.19. Having withdrawn the air from the apparatus, the resistance to the vibration was so far diminished, that the time which the pendulum took to reduce its arc from 1?.32 to 0?.73, from O0.70 to 00.42, and from 00.42 to 00.19, was in each case sufficient to give the rate of the pendulum within the respective arcs with tolerable exactness. The rate of the clock on this day was taken from its average rate in several days, viz. from the 24th to the 30th of January; exactness in the daily gain or loss of the clock was not required, as the observations were only to be used in their relation to each other. 462 CAPTAIN SABINE ON THE LENGTH OF THE SECONDS PENDULUM January 27, 1830.

To make the results agree, it is necessary to multiply the computed correction by 1.36. By the employment of this multiplier, the result obtained in the arcs of least magnitude (which as being the nearest to infinitely small arcs are presumed to be the most correct,) is not altered more than five-hundredths of a vibration; whilst the results obtained in larger arcs IN THE OBSERVATORY OF GREENWICH. 463 are brought in accordance with it.

To obviate that inconvenience I commenced with a series in large arcs; made then two series in small arcs, and concluded with a second series in large arcs; and finally took a mean between the two series in large arcs and the two series in small arcs, as the results to be compared with each other.

The irregular going of the clock (which stopped altogether soon after the fourth series was completed) may have rendered the result of this day's experiinents of less value than that of either of the preceding days, in determining the amount of the multiplier. It was not until the 5th of May following, that, the clock being repaired and replaced, I was able to resume the inquiry by the following observations conducted in the same manner as before. The clock was making 86665.0 vibrations, on an average of several days at this period. 3 o2 466 CAPTAIN SABINE ON TIE LENGTH OF THIE SECONDS PENDULUM ~~~~~~_ __ _ _ __ _ _ _ _ VIbr ti n 0 s E s Times of M Reductions bD MeAn Mean Mean Vibrations 0 . gTemp i .

I 86068.95 86068.96 If now we collect in one view the different multipliers which hlave been found from these four series of experiments, we have January 27, 1.36; January 29, 1.32; February 3, 1.61 ; May 5, 1.42: of which four results, that of February 3rd (1.61), from the unfavourable circumstances of the experiments in the irregular going of the clock already noticed, is least entitled to confidence. The arithmetical mean of the four is 1.43; and that of the three, omitting the result of February 3rd, is 1.37. If then we take 1.4 as IN THE OBSERVATORY OF GREENWICH. 467 the multiplier, to be employed in computing the compensations for the arcs in the experiments with the weight above, to be hereafter related, we may infer with probability that we employ a more correct multiplier than either 1.3 or 1.5. Now, if either of those numbers were substituted for 1.4, the effect would be to alter the rate of the pendulum with the weight above, as deduced from the experiments in the succeeding pages, one tenth of a vibration per diem. To correct the influence of this tenth of a vibration on the convertibility (the object for which the pendulum is vibrated with the weight above), the slider would require to be moved a certain quantity, which would alter the final deduction of the rate, due to the distance between the axes of suspension, less than one hundredth of a second per diem. In employing 1.4 therefore as a multiplier, any uncertainty in the final result, arising from this cause, is limited in all probability to less than .01 of a second per diem, ? 2. Weight below. On the 31st of January and 1st of February 1830, I made the following observations, for the purpose of ascertaining the compensation for the arcs when the weight was below. The clock, by DENT, was making 86313.3 vibrations. The clock had been stopped on the 30th of January, and was stopped again orn the 1st of February, to alter its pendulum. The rate was assigned by comparison with the transit clock during the two days it was going. O.~~~~Times of' Reductions ______ -~i | E | Times of l Arcs.

The difference, however, between. the results in large arcs and in small arcs, with the computed corrections applied,, is much less than takes place when the pendulum is vibrated with the weight above. With the weight below, the computed corrections being multiplied by 1.13, the results are rendered accordant with each other on both days of experiment, and the vibrations become as follows:January 3 1st, large arcs, Exp. II. 86080.99; small arcs, Exp. I. & III. 86081.00. April 28th, large arcs, Exp. 1. II. & V. 86068.92; small arcs, Exp. III. & IV. 86068.94. The alteration produced by the employment of this multiplier, in the final deduction of the rate of the pendulum from the experiments to be subsequently narrated, is an addition of 0.12 vibration per diem to the number of vibrations which would otherwise have been derived. I should have been glad to have employed a greater number of observations in the more assured determination of this multiplier, but circumstances did not permit me to pursue the inquiry further; and I have only now to refer to the consistency and concurrent indication of those results that were obtained, as an evidence that the multiplier derived from them is in all probability very near the truth. I may also notice, that a change of one unit in the second figure of decimals of this multiplier, would produce an alteration of something less than one hundredth of a second per diem in the iate of the pendulum, derived from the experiments which form. the subject of this paper. It was my intentionto have investigated experimentally the cause of the retardation being greater in large arcs than accords with the formula of reduction 470 CAPTAIN SABINE ON THE LENGTH OF THE SECONDS PENDULUM to infinitely small arcs; but circumstances not permitting me to do so at present, I have only to state my conjecture, that it is caused by the gliding of the knife edges on the planes, a consequence of the elasticity of the planes. It has been found by M. BESSEL, that small movements of this kind always took place in a pendulum vibrating on a knife edge, whatever might be the nature of the supporting planes; that its direction was the same as the motion of the pendulum,-to the right when the pendulum moved to the right, and vice versa; and that its amount was proportioned to the arcs of vibration. Supposing that the cause is as I have conjectured, it would have been satisfactory to have measured the amount of the gliding corresponding to particular arcs, directly, in the manner that M. BESSEL has done, and to have compared the correction of the length, which is the mode of compensation adopted by M. BESSEL, with the correction of the rate, which is the method that has been adopted here; by either mode the experiments ought to give the same length for the seconds pendulum. In discussing the correction for the arcs of vibration, it has appeared the most satisfactory course, to introduce the detail of the experiments relating to that branch of the subject into the body of the discussion itself. In the remainder of the paper I shall pursue the more usual course, of placing together, at the close, the detail of all the experiments, in the order and succession in which they were made; introducing into the discussion, abstracts and results, with proper references to the part of the paper containing the details. Before we enter on the examination of the rate of the pendulum, it is necessary to ascertain the reduction to a vacuum for the small residue of air which .cannot be pumped out of the apparatus, as well as for the small additional quantity which occasionally leaks in. I proceed to collect in one view the results of the experiments which were made at suitable opportunities to determine the amount of this reduction. Reduction to a Vacuum. ? 1. Weight above. The plan of experiment was to compare the vibrations made in full atmospheric pressure, with those in the exhausted apparatus, in circumstances in IN THE OBSERVATORY OF GREENWICH. 471 other respects as nearly similar as possible. By this comparison, the correction for nearly the full atmospheric pressure is ascertained; the proportional part of which is taken as the equivalent for the small residue of air which cannot be wholly withdrawn, and for the occasional small leakage of the apparatus during the experiments; the pressure withinside the glasses being duly observed and registered by means of a syphon gauge placed by the pendulum. In regarding the correction for the last remaining inch of pressure as a proportional part, namely the thirtieth, of the correction for the whole atmosphere, I refer to the experiments related in a former paper in the Philosophical Transactions, in which it was shown that the corrections for a half atmosphere, and for a quarter atmosphere, bore corresponding proportions to the correction for the full atmosphere.

The vibrations with the weight above are in excess 0.31 of a vibration. To ascertain the fraction of the tenth of an inch which it would be necessary to move the slider in order to produce perfect convertibility, and the effect of such change in the position of the slider, upon the vibrations with the weight below, we have from the experiments the following data (the letters referring as before to the detail of the experiments at the close of the paper).Weight above. vibrations.

Whence we obtain by proportion 1.637 as the position of the slider which renders the pendulum perfectly convertible: and the vibrations, in the position of perfect convertibility, 86069.09 with the weight above, and 8606,9.10 with the weight below ;-a result which, it will be seen, is in the closest accordance with the experiments H to 5, during which the slider was at 1.633. Expansion of the Pendulum. The rate of the pendulum having thus been found for the temperature of 570, we have to seek its rate at 62?, being the temperature at which Captain KATER referred the distance between the knife edges to Sir GEORGE SHUCKBURGH 'S scale. To obtain the alteration of rate corresponding to each degree of FAHRENHEIT from the data furnished by the experiments, we have the rate with the weight below, observed on the 31st of January and 1st of February IN THE OBSERVATORY OF GREENWICH. 475 at 300, pp. 467 and 469, to compare with the rate at 570 which has been deduced as above from the experiments in the preceding August and September. The position of the slider in the winter experiments was at 1.6; consequently the result is strictly comparable with the mean of the two results H to M, and W to EE, made in summer, in one of which series the slider was at 1.633, and in the other at 1.566, the mean of which is 1.6. But in fact a small change of position of the slider when the weight is below, has so little influence on the rate, that had there been even a slight difference it might have been safely disregarded for the purpose now in view.

I have reported the results of a similar comparison of the rates of an invariable pendulum, made also of plate brass, in winter and in summer; by which it was shown that a degree of FAHRENHEIT corresponded to a change of 0.44 in the rate of that pendulum also. These two results are strongly confirmatory of each other. It results, then, that the vibrations of Captain KATER'S pendulum, which at 570 have been found 86069.10, are 86066.90 at 620. The distance between the knife edges as measured by Captain KATER-is 39.44085 inches of Sir GEORGE SHUCKBURGH's scale, the pendulum and scale being at 620. The vibrations in a vacuum corresponding to this distance are 86066.90, the temperature of the pendulum being 620. We have then for the seconds pendulum in the Royal Observatory, at 620 and in a vacuum, 2 In. 2 In.

Being desirous of assuring myself of the stability of the support of the pendulum in the vacuum apparatus, I undertook a distinct series of experiments to obtain the rate of the pendulum on the iron frame, which is permanently affixed to the south wall of the pendulum room in the Royal Observatory, and designed for the use of observers with invariable pendulums, who wish to obtain a basis for their experiments on the variation of gravity at other stations. With this intention, I transferred the agate planes, which had been employed in the experiments in the vacuum apparatus, to the iron frame; and placed the pendulum on them, with the weight below, and the slider at 1.6 inch, making the observations II I-I to R R as detailed at the close of this paper. The experiments were necessarily made in the free air of the apartment, and are reduced to a vacuum by the reduction already found for the pendulum with the weight below. rThe rate of the clock, by GRAHAM, which is attached to the wall of the room beneath the iron frame, was furnished me by Mr. THOMAS GLANVILLE TAYLOR, in a memorandum which is subjoined to the detail of the observations. By a mean of the ten experiments II II to R R on the iron frame, the pendulum was found to make 86070.98 vibrations at 530 reduced to a vacuum. The equivalent at 570 is 86069.20, which differs by only 0.10 of a vibration per diem from 86069.10, the rate ascertained in the vacuum apparatus. The rate on the iron frame was obtained by thirty-three hours' vibration of the pendulum; that in the vacuum apparatus by 173 hours. So near an approximation, obtained in less than one fifth of the time that the experiments in the vacuum apparatus were continued, satisfied me that no permanent cause of difference existed, and that it only required that the experiments on the iron frame should be persevered in for the same length of time as those were in the vacuum apparatus, to produce the closest accordance. We may regard therefore the result of the experiments H H to RR, as establishing the equal stability of both supports; and as affording a fair inference that both supports are perfectly stable.

The clock's rate 'in these experiments has been deduced from daily comparisons between it and the Greenwich transit clock ; the daily rate of the latter being determined from the observations of several stars and of the sun. With reference to these observations, it may be necessary to remark that they are made by three several observers, as is sufficiently shown in the Greenwich observations by the initials of each observer's name; and in making use of these for determining right ascensions, or the rate of the clock, it becomes necessary to apply to each observed transit the constant difference which is found to exist between the observer, and the observer of the same star on the following day, with which it is compared: for this purpose I have employed the difference as pointed out by a great many observations made for the express purpose; whence it appears that if the observer T. noted the passage of a star at the time r, the observers T. T. and N. would observe it to pass at l + 0$. 1 6 and r + O.35 respectively. Making use of these, the rate of the Greenwich transit clock comes out: IN THE OBSERVATORY OF GREENWICH. 485 1829. s 5 August 21 to 24 -0.36 September 1 -0.24 25 -0.22 3 -0.32 26 -0.18 4 -0.20 27 -0.42 6 -0.38 28 -0.25 7 -0.31 29 -0.34 8 -0.11 ~~30 -0.15_ 30 -0.15 ~Mean . -0.266 31 -0.24 From the near accordance of these results with one another, and from a consideration of the inability of two or three observations (which could only be taken in some cases, on account of the cloudy weather) to determine very correctly the rate, I have preferred taking the general mean 0s.27 rather than each individual result. This was accordingly employed with the following comparisons. Comparison of the Clock DENT with the Greenwich Transit Clock. 1829. DENT. Transit Clock. Daily rate of DENT.

The rate of the clock by GRAHAM has been determined by comparisons between it and the Greenwich transit clock, made at intervals of twelve hours nearly; the rate of the latter being determined by transits of the sun and of several stars, from which it appears that the transit clock's rate was, s 1829.
