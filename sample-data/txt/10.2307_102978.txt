(1875) II. Part of a Letter from Mr Ralph Thoresby, F. R. S. concerning Pewter Money, Coyn'd in Ireland, by the late King James. Leeds, June 7. 1704. Honoured Sir, THis brings you an account of a Curiosity that relates to the late King James's Irish Moneys, which I am apt to think you never heard of, viz. a Crown piece of Pewter, inscribed Melioris tessera fati. 'Twas sent me by the Gentleman who found them in the Treasury at Dublin; whose account is so particular and curious, that I will choose to give it you in his own words. `` That King James, having turned all the Brass Guns of `` Ireland, and all the Brass and Copper Vessels of Pro`` testants that he could seize, into Coyn, viz. Half`` Crowns somewhat bigger than an English Half-penny, `` Shillings broader, but not so thick as a Farthing, and `` Six pences in proportion; it was order'd to pass cur`` rent in all Payments, even in Bonds, and discharge of `` Judgments and Statutes; (insomuch that if Ages to `` come knew not the reason, they would admire to be `` told, that there was a time when men absconded, to `` avoid receiving their Debts, as many here did:) But `` these stocks of Metal being all spent (which he began `` to Coyn in <inferred>June</inferred> 1689. and no Circulation to bring `` them back into his Treasury, he call'd in all that he `` had Coyned, and the Half-Crowns, which before `` were (1876) `` were stamped with a Face, were re-stamped with his `` Effigies on Horseback, and then paid out to those who `` brought them in, as Crowns; and the smaller, Coyns `` were melted down, and re-coyned again under the `` same Denominations, but with less Metal. After the `` turn was served by this Stratagem, he had not where`` withal to import Copper and Brass; but, for want of `` it, fell foul on the Pewter Dishes, &c. And the `` piece I sent you of that Metal was Coyned for five `` Shillings; and the Proclamation to make it passable `` was as ready as the Stamps, for it was prepared: But `` King William passing the Boyne, prevented their Pro`` claiming it. There was very little of it Coyned, for `` our Government could meet with none of it; until `` one day, rummaging all their Tinkerly Treasure, that `` they had left behind them in Dublin when they were `` routed, by accident I met with one Bag of 150 of those `` Pieces. So that the Piece I sent you,altho it's of no Intrin`` sick Value, it's a Rarity; and had I thought it would `` have been acceptable, I would have sent you a Specimen `` of every sort that he had Coyned and Re-coyned `` here. I am, Sir, Your very Humble Servant, Dublin, Novemb. the 27th, 1696. Tho. Putland. This Valuable Curiosity has the same Inscription on both sides, as the common Brass Crowns; but there is this Legend added upon the Rim of it, M E L I O R I S T E S S E R A F A T I A N N O R E G N I S E X T O.
