[47] IV. A Letter from Mr. Chr. Warren, Surgeon at Truro in Cornwall, to John Machin, Esq; Secr. R. S. Prof. Astr. Gresham. containing further Accounts of the Success of injecting medicated Liquors into the Abdomen, in the Case of an Ascites. S I R, I B E G Leave to return my best Thanks to the SOCIETY in general, and to you, Sir, in particular, for their unanimous Thanks to me, and their Approbation of what I communicated to them in relation to Jane Roman*, whom I tapp'd and injected for a Dropsy, and yet remains in statu quo; tho' she inform'd me Yesterday, that she had labour'd under a Tertian Ague ever since last January: Indeed I should not wonder, if, after Nineteen Months Space, she should want the same Operation again, in a Country where Poison [a Dram] is habitually become the common Nutriment, Physician, and Counsellor on all Occasions. Read May 24. 1744. Your kind Communication of Dr. Hales's judicious Remarks and Improvement on my Discovery ~, does me great Honour and Pleasure; and the more so, as I was so happy as to have discover'd the Use and Efficacy of Injections by means of one Puncture only, on a poor Woman, about Ten Days before I received yours; from whom I drew near fifty Pints of dropsical Lymph, by an easy Transmutation thereof into * See Philos. Trans. Num. 472, p. 12. ~ See ibid. p. 20. an [48] an appropriated medicinal Fluid; which was, without any Difficulty, retain'd within the Cavity near two Hours, and, at the Close of the Operation, drawn all off at once, without the least Symptom of a Syncope from Inanition; of which I shall beg Leave to acquaint you further, when I see how she holds it, as well as of what else remarkable may occur in the Course of my Practice. I am, with the greatest Regard to the Learned, Worthy Gentlemen of the Royal Society, S I R, Your most obliged, Truro, May 12. 1744. and obedient humble Servant, Chr. Warwick.
