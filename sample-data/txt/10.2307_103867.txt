An Account of a new Engine for raising Water, in which Horses or other Animals draw without any loss of Power (which has never yet been practised) and how the Strokes of the Pistons may be made of any Length, to prevent the loss of Water, by the too frequent opening of Valves, with many other Advantages altogether new; the Model of which was shewn to the Royal Society on the 28th of November, by Walter Churchman, the Inventor of it. The Description of this Engine is given on the Sides of the Plate, where the Engine itself is likewise delineated. Vide T A B. T H E Animals all draw horizontally, and in a streight Line, and at right Angles, whereby they exert their utmost Force. By these Advantages (403) tages a far greater Power is gain'd from the Strength of Horses, &c. than by their going round in a Circle; for by the Twist and Acuteness of the Angles, they draw in towards the Centre, whereby they waste their Power, and also shorten their Levers: Besides, their Muscles and Tendons from their hinder Legs all along their Sides to their Necks are unequally strain'd, as the Duty is hardest on one Side, even tho' their Walk is large. Therefore each of those Inconveniencies must be attended with Pain to the Animals when at Work, and a great Loss of their Strength. 2dly, A Crank does not rise quite one third of its Circle, neither do the Regulators or Rods rise or fall perpendicular, but obliquely, by which an oval Figure is made by the Piston's Motion in every Cylinder, which occasions great Friction and a loss of Water, and every Arm of it is continually varying in its Power whilst working, as its Lever is distant from the perpendicular Line, and two of the Arms (supposing it a quadruple one) as they cross the Perpendicular are always drawing to, and from their own Centre, by which the Power is not only lost, but the Time also; and farther yet, by the shortness of the Strokes, all the adjacent Water is frequently contrarily moved, and by the often opening and shutting of the Valves, there is also a great Waste of the Water, besides the many heavy Bearings, Frictions, Surges, and Repairs belonging to it; all which Inconveniencies and Impediment being thoroughly considered, there must certainly be required a much greater Power to work the same than by my Method. For, hereby, a H h h Stroke (404) Stroke of 24 Feet will rise, and by enlarging or diminishing the fix'd Wallower, you obtain a Stroke of any required Height, even to the extent of the Atmosphere's Pressure. By this great Advantage, the Water rises freer, and with greater Velocity, and as the Lifters or Forcers rise and fall exactly perpendicular, and with an equal continued Strain, and as the Bearings also are fewer and lighter, consequently the Friction in all these will be a great deal less than with the Crank, &c. And, Lastly, Seven Eights of that Water which is always lost by the slow opening and shutting of the Valves will be saved. From the above Considerations, and by the many Experiments I have made on this Occasion, in order to know the real Difference between these different ways of Working, I find, that near twice the Quantity of Water will be raised to the same Height, in the same Time, with the same Power, by my Method, more than with the best Crankwork that has ever been yet erected.
