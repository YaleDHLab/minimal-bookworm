[194] XIV. Abstract of a Letter from Mr. Wm. Arderon to Mr. Baker, F.R.S. of a ShuttleSpire taken out of the Bladder of a Boy. Norwich, Oct. 12. 1744. O N the 16th of September last, Mr. John Harmer, a Surgeon in this City, cut one Peter Riggs, a Boy about seventeen Years of Age, for the Stone; at which time there was extracted from him (to the utmost Surprize of the Spectators) an iron Shuttle Spire, four Inches long. He had, it is said, some time before, a Stoppage of Urine; and, by endeavouring with this Piece of Wire to relieve himself, and thrusting it too far along the urinary Passage, he let it drop into the Bladder, where it occasioned the same Symptoms as a Stone would have done. He underwent the Operation with great Fortitude; and said nothing of this Accident until it was all over. He is now perfectly recovered. Read Dec. 6. 1744.
