A Supposition how the white Matter is produced, which floats about in the Air in Autumn; in a Letter from the same to Mr. Baker. S I R, H A V I N G lately a large Spider in my Hand, by chance I let it fall, and it hung by its Thread, as they very commonly do. On holding my Hand very still it readily ascended up it again; and thus, by giving it a Shake, and then holding my Hand still, the Spider ascended and descended Norwich, Aug. 28. 1746. Read Feb. 26. 1746-7. [429] scended a great many times. I thought, at first, it had spun a new Thread at every Descent, and was desirous to have measured how long an one I could cause it thus to spin; but, upon a stricter Examination, I very plainly perceived, that whenever it ascended, it wound its Thread with its Fect into a sort of Coil, and when it descended only ravelled it out again. The Manner how they perform this is diverting enough; but as Spiders may be had almost in every Place, and the Experiment is so easily tried, I shall forbear describing it; and only add, that as these Coils of Thread are exactly like those floating in the Air towards the End of Summer, I think it is not improbable those are made in the same Manner, when Spiders have a Mind to direct their Course in the same Direction their Threads lie.
