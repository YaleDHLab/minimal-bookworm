[180] XXIV. Extract of a Letter from Paul Panton Esq; of Plaswgyn in Anglesey, to the Honourable Daines Barrington, V. P. concerning the Increase of Population in Anglesey. Plaswgyn in Anglesey, Oct. 3, 1772. D E A R S I R, I Wished to have sent you a fuller account of the state of population in this island; but so little care has been taken to preserve the parish registers, that scarcely any that are antient are to be met with. Upon the whole of those I send you, there is great reason to make a pleasing conclusion, that we become more healthy, and increase in population. Heretofore the inhabitants of this island lived chiefly upon fish, with which, especially herrings, these coasts were abundantly furnished. Salted herrings were their principal food. This rambling fish, the herring, having left us, our islanders have neglected pursuing other branches of the fishery, and have betaken themselves more to agriculture. The potatoe plant has not been cultivated in any great quantities here until of late years; but, since the failure of our herring fishery, it has made great part of the food of the inhaRead Feb. 25, 1773. 1 [181] inhabitants. Perhaps the want of the one, and the increased consumption of the other, may be amongst the causes that have contributed to the better health of our people. The increase in population in Llanduvnan and Pentraeth parishes, has not been owing to mines, or any new advantage introduced. The inhabitants are wholly employed in husbandry. I am, Dear S I R, Your very obliged humble servant, Paul Panton. B I R T H S and B U R I A L S, in L L A N S A D U R N Parish, Anglesey. Christened. Buried. Christened.
