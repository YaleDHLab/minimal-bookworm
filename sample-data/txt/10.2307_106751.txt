[137] VIII. Astronomical Observations. In two Letters from M. Francis de Zach, Professor of Mathematics, and Member of the Royal Academies of Sciences at Marseilles, Dijon, and Lyons, to Mr. Tiberius Cavallo, F. R. S. Read December 23, 1784. S I R, Lyons, April 4, 1783. I SEND you the account of the observations on the eclipse of the moon, which I have made together with the rev. Father LE FEVRE, Astronomer at Lyons, in the Observatory called au grand College; to which I shall add the observations of the vernal equinox; some observations on Jupiter's satellites, made at Marseilles by M. SAINT JAQUES DE SYLVABELLE; and, lastly, a new solution of a problem that occurs in computing the orbits of comets. If you think that these observations do in any way deserve the notice of the Royal Society, I shall be very glad you would communicate them. In order to ascertain the going of the pendulum clock, I took several corresponding altitudes of the sun, which you will find in the following table. On the day of the eclipse the sky was very serene, nothing could be finer, and it continued so during the observation. I determined to use an achromatic telescope of 31/2 feet length, that shews objects in their natural position, because the diluted and uncertain termination of the true shadow of the earth appears more perfectly defined by small than by VOL. LXXV. T large 138 M. DE ZACH'S Astronomical Observations. large telescopes, which magnify too much, and give too great a transit between the penumbra and the true dark shadow. On that account some celebrated astronomers advise to use for the eclipses of the moon no greater telescopes than of four or five feet length. It was remarked at Paris, that in an eclipse of the moon, observed through a telescope of DOLLOND,the focus of its object lens being 30 inches, and likewise through a telescope of five feet length; the eclipse appeared to begin 4~ 7~ sooner, and to end 4~ 7~ later, through the small than through the long telescope; the like has been remarked by several others, and it has been also observed by myself. As to my observations I am tolerably satisfied with them, as they do not differ materially from those of Father LE FEVRE, though it is known that in eclipses of the moon no greater exactness than that of a minute can be obtained. The moon's spots were carefully observed; for it is known, that the mean of the observations of the moon's spots is sufficient to ascertain the longitude of a place to 4~ or 5~ nearly. M. DE LA LANDE comparing the observations of the moon's spots in an eclipse, made the 22d of November, 1760, in Vienna, by the Imperial Astronomer Abbe HELL, with those made at the same time in Paris by M. MESSIER, finds the difference of meridians to be 56~ 13~, which agrees very exactly with that ascertained by other means. Correspondent M.

To draw the orbit of a comet that moves in a parabola or ellipsis, the problem is reduced to find the position of the axis and the perihelial distance; this position of the axis will be determined as soon as the angle is known, that the axis forms with another line, whose position is given; this line may be an ordinate to a given point of the curve, or a tangent, or a radius vector, &c. The latter is to 7 be M. DE ZACH'S Astronomical Observations. 145 be employed in preference, because the perihelial distance being a constant quantity, the angle of position then becomes the true anomaly of the comet; but as the data of this problem are only geocentric longitudes and latitudes of the comet, deduced from the immediate observations of right ascension and declination, the heliocentric longitudes and latitudes must first be calculated; but as those data are not sufficient, what is not given must be arbitrarily supposed, viz. the shortened distances (distantias curtatas). This supposition is changed and altered until the calculation will agree with the three observations, then the difference between two longitudes is the angle comprehended between the two shortened distances in the plane of the ecliptic; the whole reduced to the plane of the comet's orbit by means of the heliocentric latitude, gives the difference between the anomalies comprehended by two radius vectors, the problem then is reduced: two radius vectors being given, with the angle comprehended, to find the two true anomalies, the perihelial distance, and the time the comet puts in running its anomalies. Let therefore ~ ~ ~ ~ represent the ecliptic at an infinite distance; QPR the apparent elliptical or parabolical path of a comet; S the sun's center; P the comet's perihelion; T the place of the earth when the comet was first observed in C; I the earth's place when the comet was observed in K; ST = d, SI = ~, the distances from the earth to the sun at the first and second observation known by astronomical tables; let Cm and Kn be two perpendiculars to the plane of the ecliptic, it will be Sm = u, Sn = v the two shortened distances.

Now for the first observation the angle of elongation is b a; for the angle ATG = arc AG = ~ ~ ~ A ~ ~ G = long. ~ long. comet. = b a; the angle of the annual parallax SmT = sin.

(b a) = tang. k; the same with Kn it will be sin. ~. tang. ~/sin. (~ ~) = tang. x heliocentric latitude in K. Having thus determined the heliocentric latitudes of two observations, the radius vectors will easily be found in the supposition made for the shortened distances, for they are in the same ratio to the radius vectors as the cosine of the heliocentric latitudes are to the radius = 1; therefore the radius vector m of the first observation will be = u/cos. k and the radius vector of the second observation ~ = v/cos. x ~ Taking now the difference between the found heliocentric longitudes, we get the heliocentric motion of the comet upon the ecliptic between two shortened distances, which is to be reduced upon the comet's orbit, this heliocentric motion is therefore ~ g = m. Now to reduce this motion we have, first, sinus M. DE ZACH'S Astronomical Observations. 147 sinus totus = 1 is to cosine m:: as cotangent k is to the tangent of an angle which I put = n, and 90~ k ~ n will give an angle which I put = q. Lastly, the analogy cos. n: cos. q:: sin. k: will give the cosine of an angle ~, which is the required motion upon the orbit, or the angle comprehended between the two radius vectors m and ~. Let therefore ECPMND be the apparent parabolic path of a comet; S the sun's center; M and N two places of the comet, the angle MSN equal to its motion in longitude, or the comprehended angle ~; P the perihelion; it is required to find the two anomalies PM, PN, that is, PSM and PSN, the perihelial distance SP, and the time the comet employed to come from its perihelion P to M and N.

DE ZACH'S Astronomical Observations. The angle x defines therefore the position of the axis and the two anomalies required, the perihelial distance being p = 2~ ~ 2~ sin. x, it will be known also by the angle x. In order to find the time the comet employs in running its anomalies, let the perihelial distance just now investigated p be equal to the radius of the earth's orbit, the parabolic area swept by the radius vector will be by the nature of the parabola 2/3 PO x OM + 1/2 SO x OM = 4PO x OM + 3SO x OM/6. Now the periphery of the earth's orbit is 7: 22:: 2p: 44/7p; therefore the whole area 44/7p 1/2p = 22/7 p2. It is known that the velocity of a heavenly body moved in a circular path, is to the velocity in a parabolic path in the ratio ~2: 1. If the parabolic area of the comet is divided by ~2 it comes out 4PO x OM + 3SO x MO/6~2 equal to an area that the earth describes in the very same time; put therefore A equal to the time of a sidereal year, we shall recover the analogy; the whole area of the earth's orbit is to the time in which it is described as the parabolic area is to the time consumed in sweeping it; therefore 22/7 p2: A:: (4PO + 3SO) MO/6~2: 7A (4PO + 3SO) MO/72p2~2; but OM = SM. sin. anom. PSM and OS = SM. cos. anom. PSM; let the anomaly be = ~, we have OM = m sin. ~, and OS = m cos. ~; therefore PO = p m cos. ~. Substituting we obtain 7A (4p 4m cos. ~ + 3m cos. ~) m sin. ~/72p2~2 which is 7A (4p m cos. ~) m sin. ~/72p2~2, whereby the time is found in parts of a sidereal year. I am, &c. S I R, M.

The sky not being very favourable, only the two internal contacts were observed; the first internal contact was observed by M. ST. JACQUES DE SYLVABELLE, at 3 h. 18~ 30~ apparent time; the last internal contact by M. ST. JACQUES, at 4 h. 30~ 16~; by M. BERNARD, his Adjunctus, at 4 h. 29~ 13~. The nearest distances of Mercury's limb to that of the sun in the northern part of its disk were at h. ~ ~ 3 33 14 31 3 42 57 34 parts of the micrometer. 4 22 17 19 The apparent diameter of the sun was 2174 parts of this micrometer: I suppose the before-mentioned 2174 parts = 32~ 26~, 9. I conclude farther, by the observations, the middle of the transit at 3 h. 54~ 7~, 25, whereas I fix, by interpolation, the distances of the limbs at 3 h. 54~ 7~, 25 = 35~, 6; I have therefore semi-diameter of the sun = 16~ 13~, 4 35~, 6 = 15~ 37~, 8 + semi-diameter of Mercury = 6~ = 15~ 43~, 8 = to the least distance of centers of the sun and Mercury.

In the right-angled triangle MNP it is MP = 972~ + 6~ = 978~, MQ = 972~ 6~ = 966~; therefore NP will be found = 260~ and NQ = 210~: now NP NQ = PQ = 50~, which converted into time gives 8~ 14~ for the time the diameter of Mercury employed to run over the limb of the sun; but by the observations of M. W A L L O T I find this time constantly in both contacts 5~ 35~; therefore 8~ 14~: 12~:: 5~ 35~: 8~, 137, which should be the diameter of Mercury; and indeed M. W A L L O T, by an immediate measure, taken with an excellent wire-micrometer, finds this apparent diameter not greater than 9~, which sufficiently shews that this diameter supposed 7~ in the mean distance is also too great.
