X1II. On the oblique Refraction of Iceland Crystal. By William Hyde Wollaston, M. D. F. RI S. Read June 9, 1802. I Nthe preceding communication, I have inserted two different measures of refractive powers, distinctly observable in the Iceland crystal, as well as an estimate of its dispersive power but have reserved for a separate treatise, some remarks which the same mode of investigation has enabled me to make on its oblique refraction. The optical properties of this body have been so amply den scribed by HUYGENS, in his TraitM de la Lumiere, that it could answer little purpose to attempt to make any addition to those which he has enumerated. But, as the law to which he has reduced the oblique refractions occasioned by it, could not be verified by former methods of measurement, without considerable difficulty, it may be worth while to offer a new and easy proof of the justness of his conclusions. For, since the theory by which he was guided in his inquiries, affords (as has lately been shown by Dr. YOUNG*) a simple explanation of several phenomena not yet accounted for by any other hypothesis, it must be admitted that it is entitled to a higher degree of consideration than it has in general received. According to that hypothesis, light proceeding from any luminous centre, is prop!agated by vibrations of a medium, highlyI BAKERIAN L-cture. Phil. Trans. for 18oi.MDCCCII. { D 384 Dr. WOLLASTON on tide oblique elastic, that pervades all space. In ordinary cases, the incipient undulations are of a spherical form; but, in the Iceland crystal, light appeared to HuYGENS to proceed as if the undulations were portions of an oblate spheroid, of which the axis is parallel to the short diagonal of an equilateral piece of the crystal, and its centre the point of incidence of the ray. From this spheroidical form of the undulations, he deduces the obliquity of refraction; and lays down a law, observable in all refractions, at any surface of the spar, whether natural or artificial, which bears the closest analogy to that which obtains universally at other refracting surfaces; for as, in other cases, the ratio is given between the sine of incidence and sine of refraction, (or ordinate of the spherical undulation propagated,) so, in the Iceland crystal, the ratio between the sine of incidence and ordinate of refraction (in any one section of the spberoidical undulation) is a given ratio. If ABD (Fig. 1, Plate XV.) be any surface of the spar, let FHOK be a section of the spheroid through its centre C, and RC any ray of light falling on that surface; draw FO a dia. meter of the spheroid, in the plane of incidence RVO, and CT, its semiconjugate diameter, in the plane of refraction FTO. Then, if CI be the refracted ray, VR, the sine of incidence, shall be to El, the ordinate of refraction parallel to FC, in the constant ratio of a given line N to the semidiameter FC. In any other plane of incidence, the ratio of sine to ordinate is also constant; but it is a different ratio, according to the magnitude of that diameter in which the plane of incidence intersects the ellipse FLIOK. When the incidence of a rav passing from any medium of greater density upon a surface of this spar, is such that the Refraction of Iceland Crystal., 383 emergent ray becomes parallel to the surface, the ordinate of refraction is then a semidiameter of the spheroid; and, accordingly, the refractive power of this spar, when examined by means of a prism in different directions, should be found to vary as that semidiameter which coincides with the plane of incidence and refracting surface. The observations that I have made on this substance, accord throughout with this hypothesis of HUYGENS; the measures that I have taken, correspond more nearly than could well happen to a false theory, and are the more to be depended on, as all my experiments, excepting the last, were made prior to my acquaintance with the theory, and their agreement was deduced by subsequent computation. Exp. i. The oblique refraction of this spar is rendered visible, by cementing a surface of it to a prism of flint-glass, with a little balsam, of Tolu. When -the line of sight bisects an acute angle of a natural surface of the spar, the refractive power is seen to be less than in any other direction, and may be expressed by the sine 1,488, or its reciprocal o,67204. Exp. 2. When the plane of incidence is parallel to one of the sides, the power is ,58, of which the reciprocal is o,6,87. Exp. 3. In a direction at right angles with either side, it is found still higher, being 1,537, or its reciprocal o,6,o6. Exp. 4. And, in the plane bisecting an obtuse angle, the refractive power of the natural surface appears greatest, and is expressed by the sine 1,571, or its reciprocal o,6365. Exp. 5. When either of the two greatest solid angles of the spar contained under three obtuse angles, is cut off by a polished surface making equal angles with each of its sides, the same refractive power 1,488 is found in all directions, By the 3D X 384, Dr. WOLLASTON on the oblique theory also, the section of the spheroid is in this case a circle, and every semidiameter (FC) the same, since the plane is at right angles to the minor axis. Expb 6. If a plane surface be formed bisecting an obtuse angle of the spar, and applied to a prism, the samie minimum of refraction i,488, is found in a direction that coincides with the preceding plne, and therefore with the major axis of the generating,, ellipse; but, as the direction 'is varied, it increases so rapidly as soon to~exced the power of glass, and to be no longer ascertainable by the angle of incipient reflection. Exp. 7. The regular refraction of this spar is also too great for examination by means of any prism, for want of a medium of union of sufficient density; but, by t ial in the usual method, it measured, on an average of several experiments, i ,6 7, or its reciprocal o,6035. By assuming, as HUYGENS has done the equality of this power with the maximum of the oblique refraction we have sufficient data for construction of the spheroid by which the refractions are regulated; for we have o,670o4 (Exp. 1.) as major axis of the generating ellipse, and o6035 (Exp. 7.) will be the minor axis, parallel in position tothe short axis of the spar. The angle of inclination of this axis to the surfaces of the spar, if supposed to be equilateral, may be computed by spherical trigonometry, from any other angle that has been ascertained by measurement. The measures that I have taken are not exactly those of HUYGENS; but I nevertheless hold them in equal estimation, from the conformity which I find they bear to each other, by assistance of his theory. Reaction of Iceland Crystatl. Exp. 8. I measured with care, an angle at which two surfaces of the spar are inclined to eac other, and found it to be 1o05 5'. Hence, the greater angle of the surfaces themselves may be computed to be Io( '55; and the angle which the short axis makes with each plane surface is 45' 23' "'. If GSMP (Fig. a.) be a plane bisecting an obtuse angle of the spar, the section of the spheroid in that plane passes through the axis CS, and therefore is the generating ellipse, By calculating from the known dimensions of its major axis CP 0,67204, its minor axis CS 0:,6035, and the angle GCS 45 23' '25", CG will be foiunc&* to be o,6365, of which the reciprocal is 1,5736, differing but little from 1,571, as it appeared by measuremyent. (Exp. *) Again, if ABDE (Fig. 4.) be one of the natural surfaces, and PGp the ellipse formed by that section of the spheroid, PC being as beforeo,67204, and CG 0,636, the reciprocal of 1,67 found by measurement, (Exp. 4.) then the semidiameter CT, parallel to the side AE, which makes an angle TCP 390 2k', ,will be found to be o,6 73? instead of o06587, and its reciprocal 15152i , instead of 1,518. (Exp. 2.) The semidiameter also, in the -direction of CL, perpendicular to the jide at an angle LCP seot 57-, is found by calculation o6,6o, and its reciprocal 1,539, instead of o,6 o6 and 1,537. (Exp. 3.) From the foregoing data, the course of a ray perpendicular to the surface of the spar may likewise be computed for, since the sine of incidence is then nothing, the ordinate of refraction must be also nothing, and the ray will be refracted along the semiconiugate diameter CM1.
