(384) XI. Some Experiments about Freezing. By Mr. Desmasters. Communicated by Dr. William Musgrave, Fell. Coll. Phys. and R. S. A Tube of 1/4 of an Inch Diameter being fill'd with Water to the height of two Inches, and set to freeze in a Mixture of Snow and Salt, the Water, when perfectly frozen, appear'd 5/16 of an Inch, above the Mark it stood at before freezing. Another Tube, of almost an Inch Diameter, being fill'd with Water to the height of Six Inches, and set to freeze, as before, rose 7/8 of an Inch above the Mark. It was observable, that when the Water thus set in Snow and Salt began to freeze, a great many small Bubbles continually rose from the Bottom. XII.
