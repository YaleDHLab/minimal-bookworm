XX. Notices of some Meteors observed at Philadelphia in North-America by Joseph Breintnall, extracted out of a Letter from him to Peter Collinson, F. R. S. Philadelphia, May 9. 1738. T H E remarkable Aurora Borealis, that was seen in Europe the Beginning of last December, was not seen here. But [360] But we had a visible Aurora Borealis the 29th of December 1736. The Day was clear, with a brisk cold Wind North-west, the Evening calm and serene, and about Seven we had a red Aurora Borealis. On the 19th of November 1737. about Sun-set, many People in this Town saw a fiery Meteor in the Air, large and bright; it seemed in the Zenith, and so it seemed to them some Miles from Town; it was observed to be higher than the lower Clouds. On the 7th of December 1737. a Minute or Two before Eleven at Night, we had two Shocks of an Earthquake, greater than ever felt here before. The second Evening after, and for several Evenings in this Month, a red Vapour appeared to the Southward and South-westward, like the Aurora Borealis.
