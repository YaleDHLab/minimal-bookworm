[85] V. An Appendix to the Paper in the Philosophical Transactions for the Year 1778, Number XLII, pages 902 et seq. intitled, `` A Method of extending Cardan's `` Rule for resolving one Case of the Cubick Equation `` x3 qx = r to the other Case of the same Equation, `` which it is not naturally fitted to solve, and which is `` therefore called the irreducible Case.'' By Francis Maseres, Esq. F. R. S. Cursitor Baron of the Exchequer. Read Nov. 4, 1779. A R T I C L E I. IN the above-mentioned paper in the Philosophical Transactions the expression ~3ex the infinite series 2 + 2ss/9ee 20s4/243e4 + 308s6/6561e6 &c. is shewn to be equal to the root of the equation x3 qx = r, whenever rr/4 is less than q3/27, but greater than one half of it, or than q3/54. This expression is wholly transcendental, or composed of an infinite number of terms, to wit, the terms of the series 2 + 2ss/9ee 20s4/243e4 + 308s6/6561e6 &c. multiplied into the cuberoot of e. But I have since thought that it might be convenient on some occasions to divide this expression, if possible, into two others, whereof the one should be a 3 mere 86 Appendix to a Method of extending mere algebraick expression, or consist of a finite number of terms, and the other should be transcendental, or involve in it an infinite series. And I have accordingly discovered a method of doing this, which I will now proceed to describe. ART. 2. In the above-mentioned paper in the Philosophical Transactions I denoted the excess of q3/27 above rr/4 in the second case of the equation x3 qx = r, as well as the excess of rr/4 above q3/27 in the first case of it, by the letters ss. But I have since thought that it might have been better to denote the excess of q3/27 above rr/4 in the second case of that equation by the letters zz, in order the more clearly to distinguish it from the opposite difference rr/4 q3/27 in the first case of it, which was denoted by ss. And I therefore in the course of the following pages shall use the letters zz instead of ss to denote the said excess of q3/27 above rr/4 in the second case of the said equation, or the difference q3/27 rr/4. ART. 3. Now, if zz be substituted instead of ss in the expression ~3e x the infinite series 2 + 2ss/9ee 20s4/243e4 + ~ &c. that expression will thereby be converted into the following expression, to wit, ~3e x the infinite series 2 + 2zz/9ee 20z4/243e4 + 308z6/6561e6 &c. Therefore, if rr/4 be less CARDAN'S Rule to the second Case, &c. 87 less than q3/27 but greater than q3/54, and e be put = r/2, and zz be put = q3/27 rr/4, the root of the equation x3 qx = r will be equal to ~3 e x the infinite series 2 + 2zz/9ee 20z4/243e4 + 308z6/6561e6 &c. ART. 4. The numeral coefficients 2/9, 20/243, 308/6561, &c. of zz/ee, z4/e4, z6/e6, &c. in this series are exactly double of 1/9, 10/243, 154/6561, &c. which are the numeral coefficients of the same powers of the fraction z/e in the series 1 + z/3e zz/9ee + 5z3/81e3 10z4/243e4 + 22z5/729e5 154z6/6561e6 + 2618z7/137,781e7 &c. which is equal to the cube-root of the binomial quantity 1 + z/e; or, if the numeral coefficients of the said latter series be denoted by the capital letters A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, &c. respectively, so that A shall be = 1, B = 1/3, C = 1/9, D = 5/81, E = 10/243, F = 22/729, G = 154/6561, and H = 2618/137,781, and so on, the said numeral coefficients 2/9, 20/243, 308/6561, &c. will be equal to 2C, 2E, 2G, &C. and the series mentioned in the last Article will be 2A + 2Czz/ee 2Ez4/e4 + 2Gz6/e6 &c. and consequently the root of the equation x3 qx = r, in the second case of it, in which rr/4 is less than q3/27, will be equal to the expression ~3 e x the series 2A + 2Czz/ee 2Ez4/e4 + 2Gz6/e6 &c. ART. 5. Now the series 2A + 2Czz/ee 2Ez4/e4 + 2Gz6/e6 &c. is 88 Appendix to a Method of extending is equal to the sum of the two following serieses, to wit, 2A 2Czz/ee 2Ez4/e4 2Gz6/e6 &c. (in which all the terms following the first term are marked with the sign -, or are subtracted from the first term), and 4Czz/ee + 4Gz6/e6 + &c; and the series 2A 2Czz/ee 2Ez4/e4 2Gz6/e6 &c. is equal to the sum of the two serieses A + Bz/e Czz/ee + Dz3/e3 Ez4/e4 + ~ Gz6/e6 + &c. and A Bz/e Czz/ee Dz3/e3 Fz5/e5 Gz6/e6 &c. which are respectively equal to the cube-roots of the binomial quantities 1 + z/e and 1 z/e. Therefore the series 2A + 2Czz/ee 2Ez4/e4 + 2Gz6/e6 &c. is = ~3 1 + z/e + ~3 1 z/e + the infinite series 4Czz/ee + 4Gz6/e6 + &c. Consequently the expression ~3 e x the series 2A + 2Czz/ee 2Ez4/e4 + 2Gz6/e6 &c. is = ~3e x ~3 1 + z/e + ~3e x ~3 1 z/e + ~3e x the infinite series 4Czz/ee + ~ + &c. = ~3 e + z + ~3 e z + ~3 e x the infinite series 4Czz/ee + 4Gz6/e6 + &c. = ~3 e + z + ~3 e z + 4 ~3 e x the series Czz/ee + Gz6/e6 + Lz10/e10 + Pz14/e14 + Tz18/e18 + &c. Therefore the root of the equation x3 qx = r, in the second case of it, in which rr/4 is less than q3/27, is equal to ~3 e + z + ~3 e z + 4 ~3 e x the series Czz/ee + Gz6/e6 + Lz10/e10 + Pz14/e14 + Tz14/e14 + &c; of which expression the first part, to wit, CARDAN'S Rule to the second Case, &c. 89 wit, ~3 e + z + ~3 e z is algebraick, and the latter part, to wit, ~3 e x the series Czz/ee + Gz6/e6 + Lz10/e10 + Pz14/e14 + Tz18/e18 + &c. is transcendental. Q. E. I. (a) Of the convergency of the Series obtained in the preceding Article. ART. 6. This series Czz/ee + Gz6/e6 + Lz10/e10 + Pz14/e14 + Tz18/e18 + &c. evidently converges faster than the series 2A + 2Czz/ee 2Ez4/e4 + 2Gz6/e6 &c. or 2 + 2zz/9ee 20z4/243e4 + 308z6/6561e6 &c: and consequently the expression ~3 e + z + ~3 e z + 4~3 e x the series Czz/ee + Gz6/e6 + Lz10/e1~ + Pz14/~ + Tz18/e18 + &c. seems rather fitter (a) N. B. I have been informed that both this mixed expression of the root of the equation x3 -qx = r in the second case of it, and the merely transcendental expression of it published in the former paper, and from which this expression is derived, were invented by Monsieur NICOLE, and published in the memoirs of the French Academy of Sciences so long ago as the year 1738; and the latter of them, to wit, the transcendental expression ~3 e x the series 2 + 2ss/9ee 20s4/243e4 + 308s6/6561e6 &c. I had myself seen many years ago in Monsieur CLAIRAUT'S algebra, in the place cited in the 50th Article of my former paper, to wit, in pages 286, 287, 288. But it was obtained by the intervention of negative quantities, and the roots of negative quantities, which gave it, in my opinion, an air of great obscurity. And therefore I thought an investigation of the same series, by a method that keeps clear of those difficulties, might not be unacceptable to the lovers of these sciences, nor unworthy of a place in the Transactions of this learned body. VOL. LXX. N to 90 Appendix to a Method of extending to exhibit the value of x in the equation x3-qx = r, in the second case of it (in which rr/4 is less than q3/27), to a considerable degree of exactness than the former expression ~ 3e X the series 2 + 2zz/9ee 20z4/243e4 + 308z6/6561e6 &c. A Computation of the four first Terms of the Series obtained in Art. 5. A R T. 7. The first fifteen terms of the infinite series which is equal to the cube-root of 1 + z/e are as follows; to wit, 1 + z/3e zz/9ee + 5z3/81e3 10z4/243e4 + 22z5/729e5 154z6/6561e6 + 2618z7/137,781e7 935z8/59,049e8 + 21505z9/1,594,323e9 55913z10/4,782,969e10 + 147,407z11/14,348,907e11 1,179,256z12/129,140,163e12 + 3,174,920z13/387,420,489e13 60,323,480z14/8,135,830,269e14 + &c; or, in decimal fractions, 1 + .333,333,333, &c.

Therefore the four first terms of the series Czz/ee + Gz6/e6 + 7 Lz10/e10 CARDAN'S Rule to the second Case, ~c. 91 Lz10/e10 + Pz14/e14 + Tz18/c18 + &c. are zz/9ee + 154z6/6561e6 + 55913z10/4,782,969e10 + 60,323,480z14/8,135,830,269e14, or, in decimal fractions,.111,111,111, &c.

Therefore the root of the cubick equation x3 qx = r, in the second case of it (in which rr/4 is less than q3/27), is equal to ~ 3 e + z + ~ 3 e z + 4~3e X the series zz/9ee + 154z6/6561e6 + 55,913z10/4,782,969e10 + 60,323,480z14/8,135,830,269e14 + &c. ad infinitum, or ~ 3 e + z + ~ 3 e z + 4 ~ 3 e X the series .111,111,111, &c.

Of the best Manner of Proceeding to the Computation of more Terms of the said Series, if required. A R T. 8. If more than four terms of this last series are required, it will be necessary to compute the series 1 + z/3e zz/9ee + 5z3/81e3 10z4/243e4 + 22z5/729e5 154z6/6561e6 + &c. (which is = ~ 3 1 + z/e), to more than fifteen terms; in order to which it will be convenient to express the terms of that series in the following manner, to wit, 1 + 1/3 X Az/e 2/6 X Bzz/ee + 5/9 X Cz3/e3 8/12 X Dz4/e4 + 11/15 X Ez5/e5 14/18 X Fz6/e6 + 17/21 X Gz7/e7 20/24 X Hz8/e8 + 23/27 X Iz9/e9 26/30 X Kz10/e10 + 29/33 X N 2 Lz11/e11 92 Appendix to a Method of extending Lz11/e11 32/36 X Mz12/e12 + 35/39 X Nz13/e13 38/42 X Oz14/e14 + 41/45 X Pz15/e15 44/48 X Qz16/e16 + 47/51 X Rz17/e17 50/54 X Sz17/e~ + 53/57 X Tz~/e~ 56/60 X Vz~/e20 + 59/63 X Wz21/e21 62/66 X Xz22/e22 + &c. or A + Bz/e Czz/ee + Dz3/e3 Ez4/e4 + Fz5/e5 Gz6/e6 + Hz7/e8 + Iz8/e8 + K~i/e9 Lz10/e10 + Mz11/e~ N12/e12 + ~z13/e13 Pz14/e14 + 41/45 X Pz15/e15 44/48 X Qz16/e16 + 47/51 X Rz17/e~ 50/54 X Sz18/e18 + 53/57 X Tz19/e19 56/60 X Vz20/~20 + 59/63 X Wz21/e21 62/66 X Xz22/e22 + &c; in which it is evident that the generating fractions of the coefficients of the several terms are derived from those that immediately precede them by the continual addition of the number 3 to both their numerators and denominators. An example of the resolution of a cubick equation by means of the expression ~ 3 e + z + ~ 3 e z + 4 ~ 3 e X the series Czz/ee + Gz6/e6 + Lz10/e10 + Pz14/e~ + Tz18/e~ + ~c. given in Art. 5. A R T. 9. Let it be required to resolve the equation x3 x = 1/3 by means of the said expression. Here q is = 1, and r = 1/3; and consequently q3 is = 1, and q3/27 = 1/27, and r/2 = 1/6, and rr/4 = 1/36, which is less than 1/27, or q3/27. Therefore this equation does not come under CARDAN'S rule, but may be resolved by the expression given in Art. 5, provided that rr/4, though less than q3/27, is greater than half q3/27, or than q3/54; which it is, because 3 it CARDAN'S Rule to the second Case, &c. 93 it is = 1/36, whereas q3/54 is equal only to 1/54, which is less than 1/36. Therefore the proposed equation x3 x = 1/3 may be resolved by means of the said expression. ART. 10. Now, since in this case q is = 1, and r is = 1/3, we shall have r/2, or e, = ~ and q3/27 rr/4 (= 1/27 1/36 = 4/108 3/108 = 1/108) = 1/36 x 3; that is, zz will be = 1/36 x 3, and consequently z will be = 1/6 ~3. Therefore e + z will be = 1/6 + 1/6 ~ 3 (= ~ 3/6 ~ 3 + 1/6 ~ 3 = 3/6 x 3 + ~ 3/6 x 3 = 3 + ~ 3/6 x 3 = 3 + ~ 3/18 = 3 + 1.732,050,8/18 = 4.732,050,8/18) =.262,891,71; and e z will be = 1/6 1/6 ~ 3 (= 3 ~ 3/18 = 3 1.732,050,8/18 = 1.267,949,2/18) =.070,441,62. Therefore the cube-root of e + z is = ~ 3.262,891,71 = .640,607,91; and the cube-root of e z is = ~ 3. 070,441,62 =.412,993,40; and consequently ~ 3 e + z + ~ 3 e z is =.640,607,91 +.412,993,40= 1. 053,601,31. ART. II. It remains that we compute the infinite series Czz/ee + Gz6/e6 + Lz10/e10 + Pz14/e14 + Tz16/e16 + &c. and extract the cuberoot of e, and then multiply the said series into 4 times the said cube-root. Now the cube-root of e is in this case = ~ 3 1/6 = 1/~36 = 1/1.817,121; and consequently 4 ~ 3 e is = 4/1.817,121. And~ 94 Appendix to a Method of extending And, since zz is = 1/36 x 3, and ee is = 1/36, it follows that zz/ee will be = 1/3. Therefore z4/e4 will be = 1/9, and z6/e6 = 1/27, and z10/e10 (=z6/e6 x z4/e4 = 1/27 x 1/9) = 1/243, and z14/e14 (= z10/e10 x z4/e4 = 1/243 x 1/9)= 1/2187. Therefore the series Czz/ee + Gz6/e6 + Lz10/e10 + Pz14/e14 + &c. will in this case be = C/3 + G/27 + L/243 + P/2187 + &c. =.111,111,111,&c./3 + .023, 472, 031, &c./27 +.011, 690, 017, &c./243 +.007, 414, 542, &c./2187 + &c. = . 037, 037, 037, &c. +.000, 869, 334, &c. + 000, 048, 107, &c. + 000, 003, 390, &c. + &c. + &c. =. 037, 957, 868, &c. Therefore 4 ~3e x the series Czz/ee + Gz6/e6 + Lz10/e10 + Pz14/e14 + &c. is equal to 4/1.817,121 x. 037, 957, 868, &c. =. 151, 831, 472, &c./1.817, 121 = . 083, 556, 06. Consequently the whole expression ~ 3 e + z + ~ 3 e z + 4 ~ 3 e x the series Czz/ee + Gz6/e6 + Lz10/e10 + Pz14/e14 + &c. is = 1. 053, 601, 31 +. 083, 556, 06 = 1. 137, 157, 37; that is, the root of the proposed equation x3 x = 1/3 is = 1. 137, 157, 37. Q. E. I. ART. 12. This value of the root of the equation x3 x = 1/3 is exact to six places of figures, the more accurate value of it being 1. 137, 158, 164. We may therefore conclude that the expression here made use of to determine the value of x, to wit, ~ 3 e + z + ~ 3 e z + 4 ~ 3 e x CARDAN'S Rule to the second Case, &c. 95 4 ~ 3e x the infinite series Czz/ee + Gz6/e6 + Lz10/e10 + Pz14/e14 + &c. is somewhat preferable, with respect to the practical resolution of these equations, to the other expression of its value given in the former paper in the Philosophical Transactions, to wit, ~3e x the infinite series 2 + 2zz/9ee 20z4/243e4 + 308z6/6561e6 &c. For it appeared in Art. 42 of that paper, page 941, that the value of the root of this same equation x3 x = 1/3 obtained by computing four terms of the series 2 + 2zz/9ee 20z4/243e4 + 308z6/6561e6 &c. was 1. 137, 33; which is true only to four places of figures; whereas by computing the same number of terms of the series Czz/ee + Gz6/e6 + Lz10/e10 + Pz14/e 4 + &c. we have just now obtained a value of the same root, to wit, the number 1. 137, 157, 37, which is exact to six places of figures. This is agreeable to what was observed above in Art. 6. A Summary of the Conclusions obtained in this Paper and the former Paper to which it is an Appendix. ART. 13. I will now conclude this paper by setting down, in as concise a manner as I can, the several conclusions that have been obtained in this and the abovementioned paper in the Philosophical Transactions for the 96 Appendix to a Method of extending the year 1778, Number XLII. page 902, &c. concerning the root of the cubick equation x3 qx = r, that the whole may be seen together at one view. A R T. 14. If rr/4 is greater than q3/27, and e be put = r/2, and ss = rr/4 q3/27, it is shewn in Art. 5, of the said former paper, that the root of the equation x3 qx = r will be = ~ 3 r/2 + ~ rr/4 q3/27 +q/3 ~3 ~ r/2 + ~ rr/4 q3/27, or ~3 ~e + s + q/3 ~ 3 ~ e + s.

And, if rr/4 is less than q3/27, but greater than its half, or q3/54, and e be put, as before, = r/2, and zz = q3/27 rr/4, it is shewn in Art. 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, of the said paper, pages 927-936, that the root of the equation x3 qx = r will be equal to ~ 3e ~ the infinite series 2 + 2zz/9ee 20z4/243e4 + 308z6/6561e6 1870z8/59049e8 + 111,826z10/4,782,969e10 2,358,512z12/129,140,163e12 + 120,646,960z14/8,135,830,269e14 &c. or ~ 3e ~ the infinite series 2A + 2Czz/ee 2Ez4/e4 + 2Gz6/e6 2Iz8/e8 + 2Lz10/e10 2Nz12/e12 + 2Pz14/e14 2Rz16/e16 + 2Tz18/e18 &c; in which series the capital letters A, C, E, G, I, L, N, P, R, T, &c. denote the same numeral coefficients 1, 1/9, 10/243, 154/6561, &c. as in the last Article, and all the terms that involve the VOL.

These are the conclusions obtained in the said former paper, which is printed in the Philosophical Transactions for the year 1778, Number XLII. pages 902 949. The conclusions obtained in this paper are as follows. ART. 19. If rr/4 is less than q3/27, but greater than its half, or q3/54, and e be put, as before, = r/2, and zz=q3/27 rr/4, it is shewn in the present paper, Art. 5 and 7, that the root of the equation x3 qx = r will be equal to the mixed expression ~3 ~ e + z + ~ 3 ~ e z + 4 ~3 e ~ the infinite series zz/9ee + 154z6/6561e6 + 55913z10/4,782,969e10 + 60,323,480z14/8,135,830,269e14 + &c. or ~ 3 e + z + ~ 3 ~ e z + 4 ~ 3 e ~ the infinite series. 111,111,111, &c. ~ zz/ee +.023,472,031, &c. ~ z6/e6 +.011,690,017, &c. ~ z10/e10 + .007,414,542, &c. ~ z14/e14 + &c. or ~3 ~ e + z + ~ 3 ~ e z + 4 ~ 3e ~ the infinite series Czz/ee + Gz6/e6 + Lz10/e10 + Pz14/e14 + &c; in which series the capital letters C, G, L, P, &c. denote the 4 same CARDAN'S Rule to the second Case, ~c. 99 same numeral coefficients 1/9, 154/6561, 55913/4,782,969, 60,323,480/8,135,830,269, &c. as they denoted in the two last Articles, to wit, the coefficients of zz/ee, z6/e6, z10/e~, z14/e14, z18/e18, &c. or of the odd powers of zz/ee in the series which is equal to ~3 ~ 1 + z/e. And it is also shewn in Art. 6 and 12 of this paper, that this expression, computed to a given number of terms, gives the value of x somewhat more exactly than the former expression, ~3e x the infinite series 2 + 2zz/9ee 20z4/243e4 + 308z6/6561e6 &c. if computed only to the same number of terms. ART. 20. As to the second branch of the second case of the equation x3 qx = r, or that in which rr/4 is less than half q3/27, or than q3/54, I do not know any method of extending CARDAN'S rule to it. But I have been informed by my learned and ingenious friend Dr. CHARLES HUTTON, Professor of Mathematicks in the Royal Academy at Woolwich, that he has discovered such a method: and I hope he will soon communicate it to this learned Society.
