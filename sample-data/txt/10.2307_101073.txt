Some Experiments of Signor Carolo Rinasdini, Philosopher and Mathematician in the University of Padoua; shewing the difference of Ice made without Air, from that which is produced with Air: In the same Venetian Journal. THere was taken a Glass-cane, about 12/3 of a Florentin braccia or Ell, open at one end, of which above one Ell and a quarter was fill'd with Quick-silver, the rest with common water. This open end was shut with a finger, and inverted into a vessel with stagnant Mercury; then removing the finger, the Mercury began to fall out, so that the aggregat of the Quick-silver and water falling, the water remain'd in the upper-part of the inverted cane, now free from Air. This being done, the Cane was thus exposed to the open Air in the Month of January, in frosty weather, and in one night the water in it was congealed into Ice of a very good consistence. Afterwards Signor Rinaldini, having compared this Ice with that which was produced in the open Air, found, that the Ice in the Cane was in substance altogether like that of Hail, that is,an opaque and whitish Body; whereas that, which was made in the Air, was transparent like Chrystal. Besides, he observed, that the Ice made in the Cane was heavier in specie than that in the ambient Air: which he discover'd by putting it into a fluid, which was in specie lighter than water, but heavier than Ice made in the open Air; whereby he found,that, whereas the Ice made in the Cane sunk, that in the Air floated therein. Which Experiment seems not to favour those (saith the Author) who esteem, that Ice, made in the common Air, is produced by the extrusion of Air latitant in the water, and by the resolution of the more subtile parts, receiving in their stead the mixture of terrestrial exhaD d d 2 lations (2170) lations: considering that by the above mentioned Experiment it appears, that in the production of the Ice made in the open Air, the very Air is mixed with the Water. But of these and many other things the Author (saith the Journalist) intends to discourse in his Natural Philosophy; where he means to shew, that'tis not necessary, there should be any vacuities in the Ice, and to teach, what is to be said of the place deserted by the Mercury whether it be void of all Body, or only of the Air, that was there.
