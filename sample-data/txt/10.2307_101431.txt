An Account of Mr. Richard Lower's newly published Vindication of Doctor Willis's Diatriba de Febribus. The Title of this Curious piece, is, Diatribae Thomae Willisi Med. Doct. & Profess. Oxon. De Febribus Vindicatio, Authore Richardo Lower, &c. In it are occasionally discussed many considerable Medical and Anatomical inquiries, as, Whether a Fever does consist in an Effervescence of Blood? And if so, of what kind? Whether there be a Nervous and Nutritious Juice? Whether the office of sanguification belongs to the Blood it self, existing before those Viscera (at least) that are commonly esteemed to be the Organs of sanguification? How Nutrition is performed, and the nourishing substance assimilated? Whether the Blood affords both the Matter for the structure of the Body, and such parts also, as are fit for the nourishment of the same? Whether the Pulse of the Heart ceasing, there remains yet a certain Motion in the blood, arguing, that Pulse and Life do ultimately rest in the Blood? Whether the Umbilical Vessels convey the blood of the Mother to the Child, or whether the Faetus be for the most part form'd and L acted (78) acted by the circulating blood, before the existence of the Umbilical Vessels, or before the connecting of the Faetus with the Uterus? A new Experiment to prove, that the Chyle is not transmuted into Blood by the Liver. A discourse of the Nature of the Blood, and what difference there is between the Venal and Arterial blood, and for what Uses both the one and the other are particularly designed. Where it is considered, what Life is, and whence the Soul of Brutes, and its subsistence, and operations do depend. It is also inquired into, what the uses of the Lungs are in hot Animals? And many other such material disquisitions are to be found in this small, but very Ingenious and Learned Treatise.
