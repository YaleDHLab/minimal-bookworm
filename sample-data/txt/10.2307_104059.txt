VIII. An Extract of a Letter from Sir Conrad Sprengell, M. D. R. S. S. & Coll. Med. Lond. Licen. to Dr. Mortimer; wherein he inclosed the foregoing Account of the Plica Polonica; together with an Article from the Brellam Sammlung von datur~ und Medicin, &c. Gelchichten uponthe same Subject, translated from the High-Dutch by Dr. Mortimer, R. S. Secr. S I R, January 20th, 1730/1. * * * T H E P L I C A has been always related, and thought to be a Distemper, and to proceed from a Fever or Convulsions; but for my Part, from the best Information I could get concerning it, I G 2 think (52) think it a Product of Nastiness, by not combing their Hair, nor washing their Heads; for if it were a real Distemper, the People of Fashion could no more be free from it than the ordinary People, among whom (i. e. the ordinary and poor) it only happens. This is confirmed by an inquisitive Person,(a Correspondent of Mr. Joh. Henry Lincke, F. R. S. of Lipsick,)who sent the following Article to the Society of Breslaw, in whose Transactions, entituled, ~ ~ Datur&c. Anno 1724, Artic. 17, Mense Augusto, p. 126, it is inserted to this Purpose.) `` The great Multitude of People in Poland, who `` are troubled with this P L I C A, first made me re`` flect, whether it were a real Disease or no? I `` am now convinced, that their swinish Way of li`` ving, and the common Opinion so deeply rooted in `` the Generality of People, that this Lock of Hair `` cannot be taken off without Danger of their Lives, `` have contributed more to this Complaint than any `` real Indisposition of Body; considering that it is `` the middling or poor People, who are troubled `` with it; whom then one cannot look on without `` Horror: But no German, of whom there are great `` Numbers, who live in that Country, ever had any `` such thing grow. Many of them, who are mar`` ried to Women of Polish Birth, are scarce able to `` perswade their Wives not to train up their Chil`` dren to this Nastiness. Not long since I saw a `` Fellow in the Church, who had about seventy of `` such Locks hanging down from his Head, which `` were (53) `` were as hard twisted, as so many Penny Cords; `` that one might easily have taken his for a Medu`` sa's Head (and who knows, but that in ancient `` Times some such Locks as these might have given `` Rise to the Poetical Fiction of Snakes growing `` on the Head instead of Hair? Be that as it will, `` this is certain, it is a most odious Sight to look `` on.
