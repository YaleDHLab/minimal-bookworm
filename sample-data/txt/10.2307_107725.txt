r424) :XIII. An account of Experiments on the velocity of Sound, made in Holland. By Dr. G. MOLL, Professor of NJVatural Philosophy in the University of Utrecht, and Dr. A. VAN BEEK. Read March 18, 1824. I R ISAAC NEWTON'S formula, expressing the velocity of sound, = has since his time been investigated and demonstrated by several first-ratemathematicians. Actual experiments however on this velocity, instituted in various countries, and under different circumstances, went to prove that the celerity of sound, found by experimiment, is about one-sixth greater than can be deduced by theory. The celebrated LAPLACE accounted for this difference between experiment and theory, by showing that it could be attributed to the heat evolved by the compression of the partiles of air which is effected by the undulations of sound. It was found impossible to determine the quantity of heat thus evolved, by the compression which sound occasions in the particles of the air; and therefore it was deemed expedient to multiply Sir ISAAc NEWTON'S formula by a constant factor v 1 + k, the value of which was determined by expel riment. Sir ISAAC'S formula thus altered, became c gv' j./Vl + k. Thus, by the experiments of the French Academicians of Dr. MOLL'S account of experiments, &c. 425 1738, the most accurate on this subject of that time, the value of k was found equal to 0,4254. It is plain that this correction of the original formula is merely empirical, and dependent on the accuracy of experiments, which in 17s8, had certainly not attained the perfection which is required at present, In consequences this formula was thus altered by LAPLACE, D 7; in which c is the specific heat of the air under a constant pressure, and c is the specific heat of the air under a constant volume.* My friend Dr. VAN REES, Professor in the University of Liege, gave a demonstration of this correction a/., which C will be subjoined to the present paper,+ and which may be C/ compared with that of Mr. POISSON1' Thle value of Cc was determined by LAPLACE from experiments of Messrs. LAROCHE and BERARD,? and found equal to 1,4954; but later and more accurate experiments of Messrs. GAY LuSSAC and WELTER brought it to 1,3748. Another cause of the difference between actual experiments on the velocity of sound and its theory, exists in the variable force of the wind, which either accelerates or retards the velocity of sound, according to the direction from which it is blowing. It appears that this cause of error may be annihilated in the following manner. Let sounds be ex-* LAPLACE in Ann. de Phys. et Chim. Tom. iii. p. 238. f Dissertatio de celeritate soni, Trajet.

It is quite clear, that the action of the wind must necessarily accelerate the velocity of the sound excited atone end of the basis, as much as it will retard that at the other end, and thus the medium of these two velocities will give the velocity in tranquil air. This method was not adopted by the French Academicians of 1738, in their experiments between Monthlery and Montmartre. Cannon was fired at one of these stations, whilst the observers were at the other, and thus the results remained affected by the whole effect of the wind. It was found expedient therefore to repeat these experiments with more accuracy, and this was executed-with great precaution on Mr. LAPLACE'S proposal, by Messrs. ARAGO, PRONY, MATHIEU, BOUVARD, HUMBOLDT, and GAY LussAc. The experiments were made in 1-822, on the basis of Monthlery and Villejuif. In two successive days, the 21st and 2ed of June, 1822, seven shots were fired on both stations, and observed on the other; the difference of time 'in which the corresponding shots were fired at both stations not exceeding five minutes, and from these seven correspending shots the result was deduced. These experiments having never been made in this country with any thing like sufficient accuracy, His Royal Highness PRINCE FREDERICK, second son of His MAJESTY the KING of the NETHERLANDS, and Master General of the Ordnance, was pleased to approve of our proposal of repeating the same, and to authorise Lieutenant-Colonel KuYTENBROUWER, and the officers and men of the battalion of Artillery under the velocity of sound, made in Holland. 427 his command, to give us every assistance in their power, and to take an actual part in these experiments. SECTION II. As fitted places to make these experiments, two elevated spots were selected on the extended heaths of the Province of Utrecht. One of these is a small hill between the town of Naarden and the village of Blaricum, and called the Kooltjesberg the other is somewhat higher, and situated on the right of the road from Utrecht to Amersfoort, and very near the last town. Both places were distinctly visible from one another, and the distance was between 17000 and i8ooo metres (9664 fathoms). Our time was kept by two time-keepers, which the Minister of Marine had kindly furnished us with; one made by AnNOL D, the other by our countryman Mr. KNEBEL. But the exact interval between the observation of light, and the perception of sound, and consequently the velocity of sound, was measured with small clocks with conical pendulums. They are made at Wesel by Mr.WILHELM PFAFFIUS, and proved remarkably well adapted for this purpose. It is well known that HUIGENs laid down the properties of the conical, or centrifugal pendulum, but if we are not mistaken, they wvere employed for similar purposes for the first time by the German philosopher BENZENBERG.* These clocks with a conical pendulum divide the 24 hours of the day in 0o,ooo0,ooo parts, and one of the indexes gives I -o part of a decimal second. This index or second hand remains quiet, whilst the watch work continues moving as long as a certain spring is not pressed down with the finger; and on removing the* Some account of these clocks is given in GILBERT'S Annalen d. Physik, i804 B. i6, p. 494 and New Series, vol. v. p. 333. 428 Dr. MOLL'S account of the experiments on finger, the index is reduced to rest in the identical moment. Thus the index being at O, the spring is pressed down by the observer at the very instant the light of the opposite station is observed the index continues moving till the report of the shot is heard, when the finger is withdrawn, and the index stopped instantaneously. The number of turns and fractions of a turn of the index shows the time elapsed between the fire and the report. There was a conical or centrifugal clock on each station; besides these, each station was furnished with a good barometer, carefully compared with a standard barometer of Mr. DOLLOND, several good thermometers made by Messrs. DOLLOND and NEWMAN, besides a sufficient number of excellent telescopes of DOLLOND'S, and so placed on stands adapted for the object as to bring the opposite station without trouble in the field of the telescope. The moisture of the air was determined for the first time in such experiments by Mr. DANIELL'S hygrometer, one of which was placed at each station. The direction of the wind wavs determined by very good vanes contrived by the Artillery officers. At each station a twelve pounder and a six pounder was planted, and the instruments were disposed in, or in the vicinity of tents erected for the purpose. Professor MOLL, with Lieutenants RENAULT and DILG, was stationed at the Kooltjesberg. Dr. VAN BEEK, with Lieutenants SOMMERTON, VAN DEN BYLAARDT and SEELIG were on the other station, which is commonly called Zevenboompjes, or seven trees, from the circumstance of seven trees being planted on this lonely elevation. Several gentlemen cadets of the Artillery, and several students of the University, were at both stations employed in observing the diffhrent instruments. The barometers and thermometers were of course obthe velocity of sound, made in Holland. 429 served in the open air; Mr. DANIELL'S hygrometers were also placed in the open air; and the light of a candle reflected from the surface of the ball of the hygrometer, gave the means of observing the deposition of dew with great accuracy. It was deemed of the utmost importance that the shots on both stations should be fired at as nearly the same moment as possible. To obtain this, the following plan was adopted. At 7h 5, P. M. by the chronometer of Zevenboompjes, a rocket was fired at Zevenboompjes, which being observed at the other station of Kooltjesberg, was immediately answered by another rocket from the latter place. This was the signal that on both stations every thing was ready for observation. At 8h o' o" by the chronometer of Zevenboompjes, a cannon shot was fired on that station, whilst the observers at Kooltjesberg took as exactly as possible the time on their chronometer when the light was observed. A second shot was fired at Zevenboonmpjes at 8h 5' o' P. M. by the chronometer of that station, and the time at which the light was seen was carefully taken down by the chronometer of Kooltjesberg. By these means the difference of the two chronometers at both stations, in a distance of about 9 miles was ascertained with great accuracy; and in order to show that this preparatory investigation was made with due care, a cannon shot was fired on both places at the moment when the chronometer of Zevenboompjes marked 8" lot oi'. If the lights of both shots were seen exactly at the same time, it was a proof that the difference of both time-keepers was known, and that experiments might be safely made. We own that we did not suppose before hand, that it could 430 Dr. MoLL'S account of the experiments on be possible to fire continually guns at a distance of g miles exactly at the same second -but the very great attention and ability of our artillery men ovetcame this difficulty. Between our shots at the two stations there was never a greater difference than i" or 2,g whilst this difference in the experiments of the French philosophers of 18g2, went to 5 minutes. This exact correspondance in the firing of the guns was obtained in the following manner. At each station an officer had -the' chronometer placed before him on a small table very near the gun; a non-commissioned officer or gentle. man cadet stood ready with the port fire near the touchhole; and at the instant required the officer holding the chronometer pressed the arm of the person who was to fire the gun, which went off at the very moment. With a little practice they were certain to fire the gun at any given second. The first night of our experiments, the 23d, 24th, and 25th of January, i 823, we experienced the same annoyance of which the French philosophers had to complain the first night of theirs. The report of the; shots of Zevenboompjes was not heard at all at the station of Kooltjesberg. Butat Zevenboompjes 'all the shots of Kooltjesberg were distinctly heard Afterthe first night we constantly used the metal twelve pounders loaded with 6lbs. of gunpowder. The 2?6th of Januc ary all the shots were heard at Kooltjesberg, but none were perceived at the opposite place. But the wind shifting the following night, a good number of corresponding or simuIltaneous shots were distinctly heard on both stations. The particulars of the experiments made in these different days will be found in the table-3 annexed to this paper. The disc the velocity of sound, made in Holland. appointment we met with on the first days was however not entirely fruitless; we were convinced by it, that none but exactly corresponding shots can be of use in determining the velocity of sound. The result of the observations of 2e5th and 26th of January, when the reports were heard at one station only, and reduced to oe temperature of the centigrade scale, and dry air, give differences of -a3 whilst the observvations of 27th and 28th of January, when shots were diistinctly heard on both stations, had only a difference of 5]Lfrom each other. The time which sound employs to travel from one station to another being duly ascertained, we proceeded to measure the distance between both stations. The distances of the steeples of Utrecht and Amersfoort, Utrecht and Naarden, Naarden and Amersfoort being accurately Sknown, we meat sured angles onpnour stations betweenthese steeples, and on each steeple between the other steeples and the stations Thus the distance was calculated by four different triangles and the greatest difference between these calculations was 2m45 or 8 -feet, which appeared of no consequence in these experiments. The distances of the different steeples which we took for our basis, result from the very exact geometrical survey of General KRAYENHOFF * From these different data we found, by calculations of which the detail will be given hereafter, that in our -experiments at a temperature of 320 FAHRENHEIT, or oe of the ceetigrade scale, the velocity of sound is 332m,049, or 1o89,7445 3English feet per sexagesimal second.

Rate of Clocks with conical Pendulums. Having shown in the preceding section how the distance between the two stations was ascertained, we must now proceed to show that the clocks with conical pendulums, with which the interval of time between the light and the report was measured, kept a regular rate; for this purpose they were frequently compared on each station with the box chronometers. The following; table shows how many decimal seconds and fractions of seconds passed on the conical centricfugal pendulum clock in five minutes of the marine box chronometer.

The table shows that the conical pendulum clock, during the course of the experiments, did not alter its rate with respect of the chronometer. The comparisons between the clock and the chronometer were made at various times of the day, and immediately before and after the experiments. At the other station of Zevenboompjes, the box chronometer and conical pendulum clock were frequently compared before, during, and after the experiments. The following table shows that the accuracy of the conical pendulum clock was quite sufficient for the purpose in view.

Experiments on the velocity of sound on the 27th June,, 1823, compared with theory. Having thus far stated the means by which the distance between the stations of Kooltjesberg and Zevenboompjes was ascertained, and the rate determined of the clocks by which the velocity of sound was measured, I will now proceed to give the experiments which were made on the 27th of June, and compare the result with theory. The following table contains the time which sound employed to travel over the basis on the 27th of June, when 22 shots were simultaneously fired, and equally seen and heard on both stations. The first column of this table shows the number of the shot, the second the time which sound employed to travel from Kooltjesberg to Zevenboompjes, as observed on the latter station, and the third column the time which sound employed to come from Zevenboompjes to Koolt. jesberg, also observed on the latter place. the velocity of sound, made in Holland. 1+5 Experiments on the velocity of sound, made the 27th June, 1823.

And as the basis was equal to 17669,28 metres, or 9664,7044 fathoms,we have the velocity of sound, found by experiment as above, equal to 340,o6 metres, or 1116,032 English feet per second.

In Sir ISAAC NEWTON'S formula V/ 9 L by which the velocity of sound is expressed, D is the density of air, that of mercury being taken for unit. By BiOT'S and ARAGO'S experiments, the density of perfectly dry air was found at omr,76 barometrical pressure to be equal to unity divided by 1o466,82. But when the barometrical pressure alters and becomes p, and the temperature becomes t, we have by the law of MARIOTTE D = i0466,82Xo0n,76{ I+t oOO375 } And introducing into this formula the correction for the aqueous vapour existing in the air, and calling F the tension of aqueous vapour existing in the air, we find D = Io466,82 XO-,76 { I+ta 0,00375 } This value of D being substituted in Sir ISAAC'S formula, we have the velocity of sound by theory v /F C/gp._IO466,82XOm,76 I+t0,00375 V -_ 3D= F aVA/{10466,82XO',76{1 + t. 0,00375} }9P: According to LAPLACE, this formula must be multiplied by the square root, of the ratio between the specific heat of air at 428 Dr. MOLL'S account of the experiments on a constant volume, and the specific heat of air at a constant pressure. Thus the final formula for the velocity of sound, given by theory, is V= { 10466,82XOm,76{1 + t 0303375} }P gp X V pF Substituting in this formula the quantities stated above, theory gives the velocity of sound for the state of the atmosphere on the 27th of June, 1823, when the experiments were made, V = 335,14 metres, or 1099,885 Englishfeet; but the velocity as obtained by experiment was ,340,o6 = 1116,o32 feet. Difference between theory and experiment the 27th of June, 4,92 metres = 16,147 feet the velocity of sounds, made in Holland. 449 SECTION VII. Experi nents on the velocity of sound on 28th of June, 1823, compared with theory.

Thus, the mean velocity of sound on the 28th of June in i", is 339,34 metres = X 1 3,669 English feet.

Difference between theory and experiment 4,24 metres = 13,916 feet. Thus it appears by the experiments both of the 27th and 28th of June, that sound travels faster than its theoretical calculation. The 27th of June, difference of experiment and theory 4m,92 28th of June -4m,24 The difference between the experiments of 27th and 28th of June, is but of om62, or 2,629 feet; thatis about 472 of the mean result of the experiments of both days. the velocity of sound, mde zin Holland. s The French philosophers found a difference between their experiments of 2sd and 24th of June, 1822, of A. But the difference of 2 which we obtained, if we reduce the observations of both days to what they would have been in perfectly dry air, and in temperature of o? cent. is still remarkably lessened. The formula by which the velocity of sound in given hygrometrical circumstances, and a given temperature of the air, is reduced to what it would be in dry air of 00 cent. temperature, calling U' the velocity of sound in dry air of o0 temperature U the velocity of sound at a tension of aqueous vapour F, is as follows: + 0'00375 t.} X 0{ 37651) Yi.

Substituting these quantities in the formula, we have U' )332',38 1_090,827 English feet. The 28th June', 1823, we had U -339m,34 111s,669 feet t =l10, 215F = o,00840465;5 which being substituted in the formula, we have U'= 331m,72 1o88,661 English feet, Thus the difference between the observations of both days, when reduced to dry air, and o0 cent. is om,66 = 2,66 feet ; or a of the mean of the observations of both days. It appears also, that by our experiments of the 27th and 28th 452 Dr. MOLL'S account of the experiments on of June, 1823, the mean velocity of sound in air perfectly dry, and at o? temperature, was 3329n,05 1089,744 feet in a second. SECTION VIII. Experiments on the 25th of June, when the shots wdere not reciprocal. The following experiments will I trust prove, that in experiments on the velocity of sound, such observations can only be relied on in which the shots on both stations were reciprocal that is fell within the same second in both places, and were equally heard and seen on both stations. The o5th of June, the cannon fired at Zevenboompjes was not heard at Kooltjesberg, but at Zevenboompjes the report of the guns fired at the other place was distinctly perceived. The following table shows the time preterlapsed between the light and report, as observed at Zevenboompjes.

Difference 6r S=20,840 feet per I" between the experiments of the 2,5th and 26th of June, in which the shots were not reciproe cal. This difference is about .E of the mean of both observations. But the 27th and 28th of June, when the shots were reciprocal, the difference between the results of both days were only om,66 2,166 feet, that is about 5<Lof the mean result of the observations. From the comparison of these results we may safely infer, that only such shots will answer the purpose for which these experiments are made which are exactly fired at the same instant on both stations. It is in this respect, I imagine that our experiment may claim some attention, as the very great care and ability of our artillery men enabled us have the guns fired within the interval of one second. 4 6 Dr. MOLL's account of the experiments, &c.
