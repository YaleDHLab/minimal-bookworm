Some Communications, confirming the present Appearance of the Ring about Saturn, by M. Hugens de Zulechem and Mr. Hook. THe former writeth in a Letter of his, dated at the Hague Octob. 31. 1670. st. n. That he observ'd Saturn with his Telescope of 22 feet,a little before he came out of France, which was the last Summer of this 1670. and saw his Figure to be very conform to what it should be according to his Hypothesis; viz. the Ansae or Arms to be very narrow, insomuch that their opening appear'd not but very obscurely. The Latter hath observed the same in London,Septemb. 16. st. v. as is represented in Tab. 1. Fig. 3. An Extract out of a lately Printed Epistolary Address, made to the G. Duke of Toscany touching some Anatomical Engagements, of Laur. Bellini, Ord. Anat. Prof. at Pisa. I Promise (saith that learned Anatomist) to give the whole Doctrine of Respiration, and to comprehend it in that order,that if I am not deceived in my own affair,the matter of the principal part of the Breast,and the whole Fabrick of the Lungs shall be made certain and evident, forasmuch as all things do so aptly answer to one another, and are grounded upon Geometrical Principles. The sum of it is this in the Authors own words. Fuit in Asperam Arteriam aer, momento composito ex gravitati & vi laterali, eaque Aeri, extrinseous superficiem pectoris circumprimenti, aequiponderat. Hinc musculis Inspiratoriis sese contrahendi potestas permittitur; unde Costarum elevatio ac dilatatio, & aucta Pectoris amplitudo: Tum penitior Aeris irruptio, & expansio ductuum pulmonarium; quod totum in Inspiratione contingit. Mox proprio pondere concidentibus supra tumidum Pulmonem costis, spatium Pectoris fit Angustius, & ipsarum ac diaphragmatis vi Pulmo comprimitur; Aerque partim per os extruE e 2 ditur, Fig. II.
