[324] A Problem For sinding the Year of the Julian Period by a new and very easre Method. THis occurs in the Journal des Scavans no. 36. as it had been proposed and communicated by the Learned Jesuit DE BILLY. viz. Multiply the Solar Cycle by 4845. and the Lunar, by 4200. and that of the Indiction, by 6916. Then divide the Sum of the products by 7980. which is the Julian Period: The Remainder of the Division, without having regard to the Quotient, shall be the year enquired after. E. g. Let the Cycle of the Sun be 3; of the Moon 4; and of the Indiction 5. Multiply 3. by 4845, and you have 14535; and 4. by 4200, comes 16800; and 5. by 6916, comes 34580. The Sum of the products is 65915, which being divided by 7980. gives 8. for the Quotient, and the number 2075, which remains, is the Year of the Julian Period. Some learned Mathematicians of Paris, to whom the said P. de Billy. did propose this Problem, have found the Demonstration thereof; as the same Journal intimates.
