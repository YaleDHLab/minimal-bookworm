XLVI. Extract of Letter a from Dr. Mackenzie to Dr. Mead F. R. S. concerning Earthquakes at Smyrna. Constantinople, May 23 1750. I Observe, Sir, in Mr. Touchit's Journal, that a certain ingenious Gentleman would not allow the last Shock of an Earthquake in London to be an Earthquake, because it was not central; but rather calls it an Airquake, because it was lateral. I have felt many Shocks, since I have been in this Country; particularly in Smyrna 1739. when, Read July 5. 1750. [701] when, after the great Shock upon the 24th of March, there were some Shocks every Day for a Month; so that few or none went into Houses before the latter End of April: When I had time enough to observe their Motion, which was regularly periodic, or about the same Hour every Day. But I must differ from this unknown Gentleman's Opinion so far as to say, that every one of those Shocks was lateral, moving from the South to the North; and, as near as I could judge, the Motions formed acute Angles, somewhat resembling the Motion of Lighting.
