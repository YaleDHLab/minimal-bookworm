r190j X.e Observationzs on Altmxospherical Refraction as it oft acts astronomical Observations;, in a Letterfrom S. Groombridge, Esq. to [the Rev. Nevil Maskelyne, D. D. F. R. S. Astronomer Royal1. (Co7nmnmnicated by the Astronomer Royal. Read March 28th 8 180. 'DEAR SIR, Blackheath, 22nd January, 1810. 1HE great advantages we derive from the labours and writings of those learned men, who have preceded us; the profound researches in physical astronomy by the mathematicians of the last century and the improvements in the construction of instruments effected by the ingenuity of our modern artists: these circumstances should stimulate all those who have inclination and opportunity, to the endeavour of contributing to the common stock of knowledge. I beg leave to add my tribute of admiration to the general voice, for the large share you, Sir, have taken in the promotion of science, not only by your learned publications, but also by the liberal encouragement and assistance you have given to those who have been honoured with your acquaintance. I am, therefore, induced to commit to your protection the inclosed paper, acknowledging myself indebted to your friendly communica-, tions for much useful information. I could have wished the task had been performed at an earlier period; but as you are well acquainted with the labour required in the reduction of, fr. GROOMBRIDGE'S Observaliows, &c. ,91 so many observations by one person, it will appear to have been impracticable. I remain, Dear Sir, Your obliged and very obedient servant, STEPHEN GROOMBRIDGE. To the Rev. Dr. Maskelyne, Astronomer Royal, 4c. 4c. WATHIE N I had fixed my four feet transit circle, made by TROUGHTON, it was my intention to make observations of a sufficient number of circumpolar stars, at different altitudes, to ascertain the latitude of my observatory with the greater precision; and also to endeavour to settle the true quantityof refraction: especially as my instrument was better adapted for that purpose, both from the construction and convenient size thereof, than those which had been heretofore made. Being fixed on stone piers, it is not so liable to partial expansion, as those instruments which are supported on brass frames: and having both sides divided, with two microscopes to each face; the samne observation has the advantage of four made with a quadrant. I have also contrived, by means of sliding shutters in the roof, to prevent the rays of the sun fronm falling on any part, excepting on the object glassi. By these mneans I flatter myself that, the observations having been made with great care and attention, the result will j ruve both satisfactory and useful. Having proposed to myself the above coirse of obcsrvations, I selected the fifty stars contained in the iircst tas. fasr that purpose, the observations of which, exceedIn number CC 2 192 Mr. GROOMBRIDGE'S Observations 100o. On the quantity of refraction to be assumed at 4,5, astronomers not having been agreed, and Dr. MASKELYNE having suggested in the precepts to his folio tables, that Dr. BRADLEY having supposed the sun's parallax i oll' fro, which he inferred the refraction at 450 to be ]7"; if he had used the true parallax 82" hle 'wobld have found the refraction at the 4, altitude of 450 to be56-i". I therefore assumed and have constantly applied that quantity, correcting the same for the barometer and thermometer: the whole by the formula of Dr. BRADLEY. In the above table, the third column is the mean of the observed zenith distance corrected by the equations to ist Jan. 1807; the fourth is the mean of the computed refraction,, for each observation; the sixth is the sum of the third and fourth colums, which gives the mean double zenith distance of the Pole, according to the assumed refraction in the seventh columnl; the eighth is the correction of the assumed refraction by the factor found , o2845, which is applied to the seventh column, and gives the true double zenith dis"ance of the Pole in the ninth, the half of which is the corrected co-latitude in the tenth column. It appears that so far as w Ursam majoris, the sum or difference of the zenith distances in the seventh column are sufficiently uniform to be used for the correction of thq refraction. I then proceed to compare the first thirteen stars, where the zenith distance below the Pole is lessthan-60o, with the twenty-one following. From the former thirteen, the -mean of the seventh column is 770 i 53", 0908; and the mean sum of the -refractions in the fifth colwmn is 94, "9377; from the latter twenty-on, the means of the same olumns Are 77 ' 5o,"52488 and 185,"1357.

I have preferred the former, from' the greater number of observations to be so obtained, as well as from the more accur~ate bisection of a star, than the application of a wire to the limb of the sun; I have, however, endeavoured to render the observations of the sun, of equal consequence, by means of two fixed, and one moveable wire; the latter measures a space to one of the fixed wires, distant 29 45,"74 from the other, the sum of which is the diameter; the suna passing at the same time through the centre of the field. These wires are applied to the upper and lower linbs. of the sun by direct vision, the eye glass having a vertical, as well as a horizontal motion.l The centre of the sun is found,, knowing the distance of the extreme fixed vvires, from that in the centre of the field ; but the refraction must be applied' for each limb,, the difference of refraction at the winter solP stice being 8" ; therefore this diminution of the diameter must, be noticed. he fewf oppotnities I have had. to observe thie 1-94 Mr. GROOMBRIDGELS Observat ons solstices, have produced only eighteen observations at the summner, and thirteen at the winter, solstice.

Several of tiose made by Lieut Caol, AUDGE were single observations, with the zenith sector in one position only, and therefore were reduced by the mean collimation, found frorm the other stars; but the result shews the accuracy of his observations. The latitude of Greenwich, when corrected from the mean of circular instruments, as proposed by Mr. POND, and by the refraction for the excess of 57", will not differ more than, half a second, from the above determination. Having found by this hypothesis, the mean astronomical refraction at 45, 1 shall proceed to co spare the same, with the observations of other astronomers. M. PIAZZi has very ingeniously, and with great labour, made his deduction of the meai refraction, from the observations of Procyon, a Lyre and Aldebaran at equal altitudes, from 38" to 890 3o' zenith distance, in addition to several circumpolar stars, for his latitude . this advantage having been obtained from, his instrument moving in azimuth. The result thereof gives the mean refriction at 450 57,"3 into the formnula of Dr. BRADLEY, tang. z-3 r; which I have found, as above, 58',"1o7-. M. PIAZZI, therefore, shzews in his table of mean refractions, that at450 = 573 xtang. 4 53 r S -7" ; vhich will be =8"aot in my table. On a comtparison. with the presett French tables, the latter give 58,", ait 450, which is in excess of my oxn. The formula of M. DE LA PLACE, as given in his Iecaniqute Celeste, which is very elaborate and ingenious, beinb applied, to a constant quantity, 6o,"1616 as deterninedi frodP obserl i9b] A ffir. GROOMBRIG DE` s Observations vation, will produce a table of refractions, nearly the same as Dr. BRADLEY s, though the latter is effected by a more simple formulla. M. PIAZZI has shewn from his observations, that the actual refractions, so far as 800 from the zenith, are greater .tihan those assumed by Dr. BRADLEY; and thence to the horizon the formula of the latter produces an excess, therefore requires a reduction in the quaantity. The ninth and tenth columns of the above fifty stars, will show the same result as thlat of M. PIAZZI; viz. that below 8o0 the assumed refraction is greater than wvill be given from observation: and the mean correction required for the four last stars, from 870 to 89', will be0027, whicn he determines0,029. Those stars from the zenith to 8o0, I have already corrected, by assuming a greater constant quantity; whence it follows, that all those equations will be plus, as compared with Dr. BRADLEY; but this will not happen with those at lower altitudes, since his formula thence fails: and it is the correction thereof, which I shall next proce+d to investigate. This problem of the mean refractions so important to pracTical astronomy, which has occupied the attention of many matihematicians, has always had in view, to reconcile the known laws, of the refraction of a ray of light passing through diikerent media, waith the actual quantity deduced from observation. The i vestigations of various authors are given inthefirst volume of Mr. VINCE's Astronomy ; and tlat of Mr. SIMPSON, in his Mathematical Dissertations. It I as been proved, that the refractions vary nearly as Mie tangents of zenith distance, into a constant quantity ; and assuming the variation directly as the tangents, the approximation vill not be sensibly affected so far as 60o; but comparing these, with those at lower altion Atmosphericcal Rerction, &c c tudes, as found from observation, it will appear that the refractions vary, as the tangents of zenith distance, minus some multiple, of r (the refraction), which call y. Now the value of y will be found by the formula drawn from the investigation given at large in Mr. VINCE's Astronomy, by comparing the observed refraction, at different zenith distances, putting r refraction, a zenith distance of the highest star; r' and a' of the lowest star: then r X cot. a -r' X cot. a re-r : Applying this formula to the mean refraction of Polaris below the pole -491",5, compared with the corrected or observed refraction of each of the last three stars; the mean value of y 3,3625. Dr. BRADLEY found by comparing the refraction at 60? with that at g9, which he supposed 33' o", the value of y=2,996; he therefore assumed Se M. CASSINI found the same to be 3,226; M. BOUGUER 3,32; and Mr. SIMPSON 2,75: this difference arises from their having supposed the horizontal refraction greater than it appears to be from observation. In the dissertation of the last author, he proves, that above 70 altitude, it matters not whether you assume the refraction, according as it would be found from the increased density of the air, at the low altitudes, and which would give therefraction at 9o6 about 52', or by an uniform density, which agrees better with observation; since, in the former case, it would only affect the refraction about two seconds. Having thus assumed a greater value of y, than 3, for the coefficient of r, the mean refraction at 45o will vary inversely, as tang. z 3r : 58",1o734 : : tang. z yr: x . therefore, X _ tang. 45-3 x 5 8-173_ MDCCCX. D d 198 Mr. GROOMBRTDGE'S Observations The table of mean refractions by the proposed formula, comne pared with the observed refraction, differs with the lowest star, less than s"; but the refractions at. those low altitudes having always been found uncertain, we may presume that the result so nearly approximates the truth, that we may not possibly ascertain the refractions more correctly. However, since my deduction will soonbe submitted to the test of some excellent circular instruments, it will be seen, whether more accurate tables can be formed. M. BiOT, in the report of the National Institute, observes, that a third correction of the refractions having been supposed to arise from the vapours at low altitudes, and therefore an equation might be found from the hygrometer, he was induced to make some experiments with a prism containing warm air dried by potash, the outside of which was charged with the natural moisture of the atmosphere; but he could -discover no alteration in the refraction. He consequently infers, that the hygrometrical state of the atmosphere has no sensible effect on the refractions. Supposing an effect really to exist, a standard hygrometer would be required; since .those instruments, which show the comparative state of humidity or siccity of the atmosphere, give no scale of the velocity of the current of air which causes the change. The mean astronomical refraction being determined in this manner, it will be further necessary to investigate the equations for the barometer and thermometer; and I must premise, that I have always applied those for the latter, from the temperature shewn by the thermometer attached to the telescope. Some astronomers-have applied the correction for the external temperature, others for the mean of both; but I believe on Atmospherical Refraction, &c. 199 the majority have adopted the temperature within the observatory. It is to be regretted, that astronomers have not informed us, by what methods they have deduced these corrections of the mean refractions; I shall therefore explain that which I have adopted, in order that this hypothesis may be investigated; and any error therein, be the more easily detected. I have taken all those stars in the table, below the Pole, from P Ursce majoris to ? Aurige, both inclusive, having noticed that those observations made in winter, when the correction is additive, the assumed correction by Dr. BRADLEY'S formula appears to be too great; and this difference will be seen by the comparison in Tables II. and I1I. To these I have added Fomalhaut, containing in the whole 210o observations. Having determined the mean place of the star at a certain epoch, I find the apparent place; the difference between which and the observed place, is the apparent refraction, which call a; put b = mean refraction, c = to the correction for the barometer, and w = to the correction for the thermometer: then a-b __ b .W. b The following observation of C Cygni will suffice for an example. Observed zenith distance 830 47' 58",34; apparent zenith distance 83 56' 27",12; apparent refraction 8' 28"',78; mean refraction 8' 7"1,83; barometer So,13; correction by BRADLEY + 01 79; thermometer within 41, without 84e then a (S8 2-8",78) b (8'. 71",83) b (8'. +0, 83) c + 1 79) w ( +,0 9,5) for the thermometer within at 41, or without at 34. Proceeding in this manner with the above 2 io observations, I obtained equations for the thermometer within, from Si to dd2 2O0 Mr. GROOMBRIDGE'S Observations 79; and for the thermometer without, from 24 to So. The difference of these extremes being divided by 8, will show, the corrections for the former to every 6?, and for the latter to every 70; and assuming that the variations are in a reci. procal ratio to the degrees of the thermometer, I propose the following formula. Putting h for the degree of FAHRENHEIT'S thermometer, then 490_ -f x ,o004, when below the mean; 490 -h x ,oo03, when above the mean; will be the correction for the thermometer within and I?-h0 x 0oo2 , the correction for the thermometer without. The Tables IL. and Ill. show the near agreement of the observed and the equated factor, found as above. The barometer at its mean state may continue to be taken at 29,6 inches; and the mean point of the thermometer without, will then be at 450. The thermo. meter within, which has been assumed at 500 for the mean state, from observation, appears to be at 490; and supposing the barometer and thermometer to vary reciprocally, as the former in inches and the latter 'in degrees, the mean point of each is in an inverse ratio to the other, and might be changed if thought expedient. Indeed it appears from the mean of more than looo observations of these circumpolar stars at all seasons, that the mean state of the barometer is 29,85, and of the thermometer 520; yet, as the sum of the two corrections would still be the same, there cannot be occasion to alter the mean point of the former, especially as this might not be a general rule for every climate. It has very rarely happened, that I could make any observation, when the barometer has been below 29 inches which causes the mean state to be so high as 29,85; but it may be otherwise in places, on Atmospherical Refraction, &c. 201 where the atmosphere is not so charged with vapours, as that of this country. I have, in the Table IV. shewn the mean refractions, according to various authors; the first column contains those of Mr. SIMPSON, from the observations of Dr. BEVIS; the second, those of Dr. BRADLEY, by his formula, tang. z r x 57s t; but this quantity having been found, from later observations, to have been too small; the third column contains the same formula, into 58",1o7; yet the refractions, at low altitudes, will be found too great, and this excess has been corrected by M. PIAZZI, using arbitrary equations, which will bring them nearer to the truth, as shown in the fourth column. The more uniform correction of the whole will be, as I have proposed in the above theorems by increasing the coefficient of r; a corollary from which will be drawn, that the incre-ment of the tangents near the horizon will cause the equations of M. PIAZZI to vanish. The fifth column contains the refractions "of the French tables; and the sixth, my own; viz. tang. z -33625r x 58", 192On inspection of this table, it will appear, that the refractions by different formula do not vary considerably, so far as 800; and thence to 870, my deductions are rather in excess of the French tables; below which, mine are rather less. Whether this arises from the defect of the formula, I cannot determine; since the wall of Greenwich park being above my horizon, I cannot observe lower than 882-?: however, so far as 88', the formula I have proposed, agrees with observation.
