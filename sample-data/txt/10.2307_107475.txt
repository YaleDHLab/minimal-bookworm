C 538 3 XVIII; New experimental researches on some of the leading doc. trines of caloric; particularly on the relation between the elasticity, temperature, and latent heat of different vapours; and on thermometric admeasurement and capacity. By Andrew Ure, M D. Communicated by W. HLWollaston, Ml. D. F. R. S. Read Api so, i8i8. Glasgow, July IS 17. i. On the elasticforce of vapours, with new formuk to determine i at any temperature; and a review of those given by DALTON and BMOT. T HE phenomena attending the conversion of liquids into elastic fluids, were first accurately investigated by Dr. BLACK. He observed in the rising of vapour, and melting of ice, a beautiful system of relations, connecting and modifying the grandest operations of nature, while they were destined to afford new principles for the advancement of the arts. If it be the prerogative and characteristic of genius, to discover in the most familiar, or, as some would say, vulgar phenomena, that mystic chain of causation, which had eluded all other eyes, unquestionably, the doctrines of latent heat entitle their author to rank in the first class of philosophers. Dr. BLACK directed his attention principally to the establish. ment -of the general laws, which he placed on an immoveable basis; leaving to his pupils, the subordinate task of investigating their individual applications. Hence, the elastic forces of the vapours, arising from different bodies, at different temperatures, seem to have occupied him very little, if at all. Dr. URE'S new eperiZrental reseatches, &c. 9 Thlis subje-ct was examitne, howev with great -ability, 1by two of his most distinguished friends, Professor Roso nd Mr. WATT. The investigations of the former were pised in the Encyclopeadia Britannica, article steam; while we ~have still to regret our ignorance of those executed by the latter philosopher, with probably a more tcomrplete apparatus, and more extensive views. We are indebted to him,-indeed, for sAme curious observation on the-latent heat of steam, at different temperatures, which make us lament more, the want of those on the elastic forces themselves. Mr. ADALTON, whose peculiar apeculatio -on caloric nd meteorology led him to study -the formation and variable elasticity of vapour with great attention, has since then favoured the world with many excellent dissertations, and is now reckoned the first authority on the subject. Mr. DAToNs experiments onl the steam of water were carried no higher than its ordinary boiling point; but from the observed prroa gression of its elastic force lieinvestigated a formula, and calculated from -it a table for the higher temperatures.* In the second number of the Journal Polytechnique M BETANCOURT an eminentoSpanish engineer, longs resident at Paris, published a set of experime nts on the same subject, the results of which diffier from those of Mr. DALTON in many pairticulars, but most remarkably in the higher partof the scale. HEaving had my mind often called to this important inquiry in the course of -my public lectures on the applications of Science to the Arts, an apparatus of a very simple nature occurred to me, about two years ago, by which I hoped to be* Manchester Memoirs, vol. v. p.-563.MDCCCXVIII, y Dr. URE'S new experimental researches able to determine, with great precision, the, elastic forces of vapours at any temperature, from zero of FAHRENHEIT, to a much higher degree of heat than even BETANCOURT seems to have reached. The experiments were made soon after that time, but circumstances have till now prevented me from arranging them for publication. With BETANCOURT'S apparatus I am not acquainted, having seen only the brief table of results, inserted in our systematical works on chemistry. Professor ROBISON'S consisted of a strong boiler or digester, containing the water, and furnished with three small apertures; the first receiving the bulb of a thermometer, the second covered with a safety valve, and the third having a barometer tube attached. At first I used a similar construction, but finding it hazardous, and somewhat unmanageable in the high heats, and difficult to render air tight in the lower temperatures, I abandoned it, after some unsatisfactory trials. At the low degrees of heat, the vacant part of the barometer tube introduces errors, since it has not the temperature of the boiler; and the bulb of the barometer, used in high heats, occasions a similar fallacy in the determination of the true elasticities. Still however, it weas ingeniously conceived, and the results furnish good approximations, creditable to the celebrated experimenter.* They agree nearly with those of BETANcouRT, being obtained probably in a similar way. The method adopted by Mr. DALTON, is recommended by an elegant simplicity. It is merely a common barometer, into which a little of the vapour-giving liquid is introduced, so as to moisten and float above the mercury. The vapour which is* See Encyclopmdia Britannica, vol. xvii. p. 7392d Edition. on some of the leading doctrines of caloric, &c. generated, depresses more or less the barometric column. Hence, by subjecting the liquid to successive degrees of teens perature, the corresponding depressions of the barometer, or elasticities of the vapour, are obtained. The only difficulty in this mode of operating, is to bring a considerable length of vertical tube to an uniform temperature. Mr. DALTON, well aware of this source of error, -obviated it in a great measure, by taking a series of different tubes, decreasing in their lengths with the increasing expansions of thevapour, and concomitant descent of the mercurial column. In several experiments conducted on this plan, I found it scarcely possible to obtain results rigidly corresponding with each other, when the column of vapour, exposed in the barometer tube to the influence of surrounding heat, exceeded two inches in length. M. BIOT, in his system of physics recently published, while he adopts Mr. DALTONSs results as the basis of his reasoning, treats fully of this difficulty, and suggests an ingenious means of avoiding it. "We have had occasion several times to "remark," says he," that the temperature of a mass of liquid "c which cools in the air, is not entirely the same at the bottom, "c as it is at the top of the vessel; because the colder particles Ct subside into the lower strata, by the excess of their weight. "c Thus the temperature of the column of hot water, which Arc surrounds the tube in the preceding experiment, cannot "c be rigorously uniform throughout its whole height. We "c may endeavour to render it equal, by agitating and mingling "t the different strata of which it is composed; but this would 34? Dr. URE'S new eperimental researches be attendedl with no little difficulty. It would be better to "have several. thermometers suspended at different heights, 'in the body of the water, and. to take the arithmetical mean, of their indications. Or otherwise, which would probably "be more exact, we might employ a thermometer having a "cylindrical bulb, equal in length to the column of vapour. It would then be necessary that the column of water should "rise sufficiently above this vapour to allow the thermo!"meter bulb to be equally immersed, or wemust make on, its indications the small correction mentioned p. 59, in Qorder to reduce the temperature of the cylinder of mercury, "to the temperature of the reservoir. Theemployment of such a thermometer may appear at first sight sufficiently 'C difficult, since it seems that the length of the cylindrical. reservoir m1 ust be very cons drl, i f t elastic force of 'the vapour be great.*" He then proceeds to show how this difficulty may be oboe viated (as indeed it hadpreviously been by Mr. DALTON)-, by taking barometer tubes successively shortened, as the force of the steam is augmented by heat., He proposes to use four, between the freezing and boiling points of water, each being two decimeters, or nearly 8 inches long, and the thermometer bulb having also that length. The plan which I imagined, asa it completely obviates the source of errors arising from the, large and variable space occupied by the vapour, supersedes, the necessity of employing M, BoTsTs singular remedy. Itlikewise avoids other complications, introduced by the heatmigand consequent elongation of the mercurial column itself* Traite de Physique.

Oft& sume f o 8ain X43 ) attending all the other methods; and, scarcely capable of being exactly appreciated at high temperatures with the apparatus of Professor lonIsoN. The space over which the vapour extends in my instrument, need never be greater than half an inch of a barometer tube, against the side of which part the oblong bulb of a delicate thermometer rests, so as to indicate the true temperature. And though the liquid and incumbent vapour are thus always restricted to the summit of the barometer tube, we can, .notwithstanding, measure its progressive range of elasticity, from zero of FAHRENHEIT to one hundred, or even two hundred, degrees above the boiling point of water, from an elasticity of 0.07 of an inch, to that capable of sustainingt 4feet, or even 36 of mercury. Fig. t (P1. XIX.) represents the construction employed for temperatures under and a little above the boiling point Fig. X and d are used for highler temperatures. the last is the more convenient of the two. Each was susb pended from a lofty window ceiling, and placed in a truly vertical position by means of a plumb line. One simple principle pervades the, whole train of experiments; which is, that the progressive increase of elastic force developed by heat from the liquid, incumbent on the mercury at I I I", is measured by the length of column which must be. added over L, the primitive level below, in order to restore the quicksilver to its primitive level above, at I. These two, stations, or points of departure, are nicely defined by a ring of fine platina wire twisted firmly around the tube. At the commencement of the experiment, after the liquid well freed from air has been let up, the quicksilver is made a tangent to the edge of the upper ring, by cautiously pouring 344 Dr. URE's new experimental researches mercury in a slender stream into the open leg of the syphon D. The level ring below is then carefully adjusted. From the mode of conducting my experiments, there remained always a quantity of liquid in contact with the vapour, a circumstance essential to accuracy in this research. Suppose the temperature of the water or the oil in A to be 920 F., as denoted by a delicate thermometer, or by the liquefaction of ice; communicate heat to the cylinder A, by means of two argand flames, playing gently on its shoulder at each side. When the thermometer indicates 42', modify the flames or remove them, so as to maintain an uniform temperature for a few minutes. A film or line of light will now be perceived between the mercury and the ring at 1, as is seen under the vernier of a mountain barometer when it is raised a few feet off the ground. Were the tube at I and L of equal area, or were the relation of the areas experimentally determined, then the rise of the quicksilver above L would be one half, or a known submultiple of the total depression, equivalent to the additional elasticity of the vapour at 402 above that at 2 Since the depressions, however, for qo or 4o degrees in this part of the scale are exceedingly small, one half of the quantity can scarcely be ascertained with suitable precision, even after taking the above precautions. And 'besides, the other sources of error, or at least embarrassment, from the inequalities of the tube, and from the lengthening space occupied by the vapour, as the temperature ascends, render this method of reduction very ineligible. By the other plan we avoid all these evils. For whatever additional elasticity we communicate to the vapour above 1, it will be faithfully represented and measured, by the on some of the leading doctrines of calonc, &c. 34,5 mercurial column which we must add over L, in order to overcome it, and restore the quicksilver under I to its zero or initial level, when the platina ring becomes once more a tangent to the mercury.* At E a piece of cork is fixed, between the parallel legs of the syphon, to sustain it, and to serve as a point by which the whole is steadily suspended. For temperatures above the boiling point, the part of the syphon under E is evidently superfluous,} merely containing in its two legs a useless weight of equipoised mercury. Accordingly for high heats, the apparatus fig. A, or 3, is employed, and the same method of procedure is adopted. The aperture at 0, fig. 3, admits the bulb of the thertnometer, which rests as usual on Pt. The recurved part of the tube is filled with mercury, and then a little liquid is passed through it to the sealed end. Heat is now applied by an argand flame to the bottom of C, which is filled with oil or water, and the temperature is kept steadily at 212e for some minutes. Then a few drops of quicksilver may require to be added to DI till LI and I" be in the same horizontal plane. The farther conduct of the experiment differs in no respect from what has been already described. The liquid in C is progressively heated, and at each stage mercury is progressively added over L" to restore the initial level, or volume at el, by equipoising the progressive elasticity. The column above L" being measured, represents the succession of elastic forces. When this column is wished to extend very high, the vertical tube requires to be placed for support in the groove of a long wooden prism. * Rings of other metals will not suit; for their expansions being much greater than that of glass, they become loose with the elevation of temperature. 346 Dr. UR:E's new expertmental researches The height of the coltumn in some of my experiments being nearly i2 -feet, it became necessary to em ploy a ladder to rach its top. I found it to be convenient in this case, after observing that the column of vapour had attained its primitive magnitude to note down the temperature with the altitude of th column;. then immediately to pourin a measured quantity of mercury nearly equal to three vertical inches, and to wait till the slow progress of the heating again brought the vapour in equili-brio with this new pressure, which at first had pushed the mercury within the platina ring at P'. When the lower surface of the mercury was again a tangent to this ring, the temperature and altitude were both instantly observed. This mode of conducting the process will account for the experimental temperatures being very often odd and fractional numbers. I present them to the public as they were recorded on the instant in that particular repetition of the experiment which I consider most entitled to confidence. To trim and fashion the results into an orderly looking series, would have been an easy task; but in my opinion this is a species of deception very injurious to the cause of science, and a deviation from the rigid truth of observation, which ought never to be made for any hypothesis. We shall afterwards have ample opportunities of exposing the fallacy of such premature geof. metrical refinements. The thermometers were constructed by CREIGHTON, with his well known nicety, and the divisions were read off with a lens, so that -O of a degree could be distinguished. After bestowing the utmost pains in repeating the experiments during a period of nearly two months, I found that the only way of removing the little discrepancies, which crept in on sone of th eading doctrines of caloric, &c. 347 between contiguous measures, was to adopt the astronomical plan of multiplying observations and deducing truth from the mean. It is essential to heat with extreme slowness and circumspection, the vessels, A, B, C. One repetition of the experiment occupies on an average 7 hours. TABLE I.

It is the concurrent opinion of all chemical philosophers, that caloric travels downwards in liquids with extreme slowness and difficulty. Indeed, Count RUMFORD's experiments led him to infer that heat could not descend in fluids at all. It is evident that in my constructions, figures i, 2, and & only that small portion of quicksilver, within the vessels MDCCCXVIII. Z z '0 4 8 IDr. Uai's new experimental researches A, B, and C, will be affected by the heat, but the measuring column is beyond the reach of its influence. A surprising accordance will be perceived between my numbers, and those given by Mr. DALTON between 39? and stood though mine were obtained with a different modification of apparatus. Above the boiling point, where the table of Mr. DALTON IS deduced from calculation, the accordance soon ceases. But as my apparatus and mode of using it were precisely the same as in the former part of the range, my results, if entitled to confidence in the one case, must be so in the other. At 2800 BETANCOURT'S number and mine are not much different, the former being o05 inches, the latter 1o02 Being perfectly convinced, by repeating the experiments in different circumstances, that Mr. DALTON'S ratio of progression, though apparently accommodated to the intervals between 3s2 and 2120, could not serve for the higher ranges,* I endeavoured to discover a simple rule of more general application. It is above 2 i2, indeed that for the purposes of art, the knowledge of the force of steam is required. I first tried the differential method, so useful for determining the distant links of a concatenated series. Without doing much violence to the above numbers, the forces corresponding to loo 110o, 120t, 1 3Q0 f4o?, and 150?, may be w tritten in a series of which the 5th order of differences = o. Then if d' d" d"' div dV, represent the first terms, in the firsts second, third, fourth, and fifth order of differences, the ntb term of the series is* Dr. YouNG remarks onDALToW's ratio, ?

By the same equation we find the 20th term or for 290? to be 124.28, while experiment gives290.15, showing a difference of 4.13 inches. At a higher point the error becomes greater. We here see that a geometrical series may coincide 350 Dr)r. UREx's new experimental researchec apparently through a considerable range with experiment, and yet be inaccurate when farther extended. Dissatisfied, therefore, with this approximation, I prosecuted the inquiry, and had the happiness to discover a very simple and beautiful ratio, which will actually apply through an extensive scale of temperature, and is incomparably easier in practice than the preceding rule. The elastic force at 2.129= so inches being divided by .8, will give the force for 10 below; this quotient divided by 1.24, will give that for 1i00 lower; and so on progressively. To obtain the forces above ?12, we have merely to multiply 3o by the ratio, 1.23 for the force at 220; this product by 1.2? for that at ?3??, and thus for each successive interval of io? above the boiling; point. Thus so x 1.23 = F222*. 30 x 123 X 1.22 = F232., using F to denote the force at any temperature n, according to the notation of LAPLACE. By departing from the point of 210o F., we shall obtains results equally accurate, but mnore convenient for comparison with the experimental table.

At these high heats, it is very possible that the experiment may be in error by i inch, which is the whole difference here. About half a degree of FAHRENHEIT misnoted, would give this deviation. Such a correspondence, therefore, of observation with the calculated results, shows that we have found a rule of perfect accuracy for all purposes of engineering, &c. If I am asked whether this formula coincides at every link with the chain of nature, I freely acknowledge, that I do not imagine it strictly so to do. But still it affords approximations such, that within moderate limits, I cannot tell whether to place more confidence in them, or in those found by experiment. It has moreover the rare advantage of being extremely simple, and level to the capacity of all practical men. In BIOT's excellent work above quoted, where many of the hitherto vague disquisitions of physical science have been happily brought within the pale of geometry, this celebrated philosopher has deduced, from Mr. DALTON'S experiments on the force of steam a general formula for determining its elasticity at any temperature. In investigating this formula, he represents the decrease of the logarithms of the elastic forces by a series of terms of the form an + bn2 + cn3 ; a b c being constant coefficients. Thus, Log. F? Log. So + an +4 6bn + cn3 It is unnecessary to employ powers of n higher than the cube, because their coefficients would be insensible, as the calculation will show. To determine the coefficients a b c, he makes use of the elastic forces, observed at the temperatures on the centigrade scale of 1000, 750, e, and 25X whence result these conditions, 354 Dr. UEt's new exPerimental researches n0 F =So.ooinnches n = 25 F s X _ so F5_0 g n-75 F75= 0.910 Substituting these conditions in the above general formula, and bearing in mind that the logarithm of a fraction is equal to the logarithm of the numerator minus the logarithm of the denominator, we have the three following equations of conditions. 0-4259687 25. a + 625 b +4 15625 c. _ 0.9330519 = 50. a +4 250o b + 1X25000 C. -1.5180799 = 75. a +4 5695 b + 421875 c.

Then dividing each of the resulting equal tions by the coefficient of b, we have _ ooooo6489t6o = b . 75 c. 0.oooo64o4685 = b + 100 c. Subtracting the one of these from the other, b will disappear; and dividing it by the coefficient of c, we shall have c. Next, by substituting the value of c in one of these equations, we get b. Lastly, putting b and c in one of the two first equa. tions, we have a. Thus we find a _o0.0537419550 b _ -.00006742735 c + o.ooooooosO8i Whence the whole formula Log. F. = -Log. So + an' + bn2 + cn3 is completely determined, and may serve for cal. culating F,, relative to any proposed value of n. on some of the leading doctrnes of calric:, &C. 355 If we make, for example, n = ioo, we shall have the elastic force at ioo degrees below the boiling point, or at the temo. perature of melting ice.

BIOT, our formula as representing the experiments of Mr. DALTON. To introduce the FAHRENHEIT degrees into the formula, calling themf, and counting from 212, we have O f = n; and substituting this value of n in the preceding formula, we obtain a 000854121972 b 0-o. oooo2081091 C,0-w 4 0. oooooooo38o, c-+~~~~~ 2 + ????o?Sf whence Log.

Mr. DALTON'S table 125.85 The difference between experiment, and both calculations, is now excessive, and even between the two latter it amounts to nearly 9 inches. From this ample investigation, we may legitimately conclude, that we ought to receive such geometrical representations with great caution. M. BIor, indeed, with a candour becoming his genius, admits these formulae to be merely tentative approximations. The high reputation of this philosopher, and the geometrical skill here displayed, might have led the scientific world to repose confidence in his formula, within the limits of CU52 degrees centigrade ioo FAHR. It was therefore entitled to a deliberate examination. It is curious to observe that my very simple formula, Log. F = Log. 28.9 + n. Log. r, gives good approximations, * 1300 centigr. gives by M.

BIoT'S formula gives a result Si inches, and Mr. DALTON'S 40 in defect. Of Professor ROBISON's higher numbers, it is merely necessary to examine the successive differences for every ioe above 2120. These are 7.2, 8.9, 1o.2, 11.9, 13.5, 13.8, i.8. and the second differences are + 1.7 + 1-3 + 1.7 + t.6 + 0.3 2.0. Such striking irregularities cannot exist in the progression of nature. BETANCOURT'S are liable to a similar censure. We may find indeed small discrepancies in the best observa. tions at such temperatures. ? II. Experiments to determine the elasticfrrces of the vapours of alcohol, ether, oil of turpentine, andpetroleum or naphtha. The determination of the elasticities of these vapours is a very interesting problem in chemical philosophy. It may possibly unfold the law which connects temperature and elastic energy, and it may furnish likewise some useful applications. Mr. DALToN has examined the sublect with considerable care. on some of the leading doctrines of caloric, &c. 59 My experiments were performed with the apparatus above described, and were verified by frequent repetitions. The following results were noted down during the progress of the experiments. TABLE III. Elastic forces of the vapours of alcohol, ether, oil of turpentine, and petroleum or naphtha. Ether.

The ether of the shops as prepared by the eminent London apothecaries, boils generally at ii2'; but when washed with water, or re-distilled, it boils at io4g or io5'. It may by rectification, however, be made to boil at a still lower temperature. Concerning the boiling point of oil of turpentine, curious (may we say ridiculous) discrepancies exist in our systems of chemistry. Dr. MURRAY, for example, in the table of the scale of temperature at the end of the first volume of his valuable system, last edition, places the boiling point of oil of turpentine at 56o0. Mr. DALTON, vol.: 1. p. 39. of his new system of chemical philosophy, says " several authors have it that oil of turpentine boils at 5600. 1 do not know how the mistake originated, but it boils below 9 IV. 'like the rest of the essential oils."' I made with much care several experiments on this point, previous to ascertaining the force of its vapour, and found its boiling point to be about 3160. When recently distilled, however, it will boil at 3S?Did it boil below, or even at 21e, as Mr. DALTON asserts, then, long before the included portion in the above experiments had reached the 3o4th degree, it would have acquired such an elasticity as to support a high column of mercury instead of being barely in equilibrio with the atmospheric pressure. Plunge a phial half filled with fresh oil of turpentine into a metal cup containing any fixed oil. Heat the cup gradually. It will be found that, at the temperature of Fit, the oil remains in steady ebullition, as indicated by a thermometer suspended in the centre of the phial. Prior to this, even at on some of the leading doctrines of caloric, &c. 361 ?120, some small bubbles will be evolved, principally owing to the moisture dispersed in the pores of the oil, from the water originally mixed with the crude turpentine in its distillation. If the heat be very rapidly thrown in, while the upper surface of the oil of turpentine has the area only of a one or two ounce phial, it is possible to heat it to 3600 or '37eI in apparent contradiction to the theory of latent heat; for when a liquid boils in an open vessel, according to Dr. BLACK, its temperature should remain stationary. The true cause of this phenomenon is developed towards the conclusion of this memoir. The specific caloric of the vapour of the volatile oil is so small, compared to that of water, that the heat may readily be quicker introduced than the boiling process can abstract it. Concerning the boiling point of this oil, I have since inquired of a manufacturer; and he states its boiling point at aor. Essential oil of rosemary, when kept for some time, boils at ?70 ; recent oil at 2120. To assign the cause of this difference, is foreign to our present obj ect.s The vapour of ether follows nearly the same rate of expand sion as water, if we start from their respective boiling points. This was observed also in Mr. DALTON'S experiments ; and from this single analogy, chiefly, he laid down the general law, "that the variation in the force of vapour from all liquids "is the same for the same variation of temperature, reckon"ing from vapour of any given force.' My experiments on oil of turpentine and petroleum show the fallacy of this generalization, if we reckon the common thermometric scale a tolerably correct index of temperature; but if, with Mr. DALTON, we consider our thermometric scale, 362 r UxEs new experimental researches as very erroneous, then ether itself is an exception to its own law, to use this paradoxical, though just expression. In consequence of his peculiar thermometric ideas, Mr. DALTON has abrogated the above law, which he had himself framed; though it is curious to observe, in some respectable treatises on chemistry, both hypotheses detailed, without indicating their mutual incompatibility. M. BIOT, likewise, far from imagining that the law had been repealed for 8 or 9 years, proposes to judge by its provisions of the total elastic force of every vapour at ioo? centigrade, to serve as the basis of the determination of their respective specific gravities at that temperature.* 'My experiments show that from io5? to 1670.5' FAHRENHEIT, ether trebles the tension of its vapour, as water also does from e1ig to ?7q,.7; both containing nearly, but by no means exactly, equal intervals of the FAHRENHEIT graduation. According to Mr. DALTON'S corrected scale of temperature, we have, 212 FAH. 212' DALTON. 105o FAH. = -ii DALTON. 273 F. = 2`56. D. 167.5 F. 176 D. real interval = 444 by DALTON. BY DALTON 57 the real interval of temperature. Thus we see, that while the interval for trebling the tension of ethereal vapour is 570, that for aqueous vapour is only 4404; quantities that are to each other nearly as ioo: 8o. Hence, according to this eminent chemist, ether must take for* "e On peut calculer par la loh de M. DALrow, quelle doit etre, pour chacun d'eux, la force elastique totale de sa vapeur a la temperature de ioo degres." Trait6 de Physique, Tome i. p. 393, on zsome f the leadin doctrnes of caloric, &c. 363 trebling the force of its vapour a fifth part more heat than water does. I hope presently to be able to adduce satisfactory experimental evidence, that our thermometric indications are not at all so unequable as Mr. DALTON Conceives. Meanwhile, in examining closely the table of the vapour of ether, a beautiful analogy with that of water presented itself. The series of ratios representing the progression of the latter being lowered a single step, will accurately fit the former. At so inches of elasticity t.23 was our initial number for aqueous vapour; for ethereal, it becomes i.22; increasing or diminishing by unity eachr time in the second decimal figure, according as we descend or ascend by intervals of 1o0 of the FAHRENHEIT scale. The following is a general view of the results. TABLE IV. The observed tension of ethereal vapour compared with the ratios 1.22, 1.23, &c, and 1.22, 1.2i, &c. Temp. Quotients. Expert. Temp. Product.

In the MDCCCXVIII. 3 B 864 Dr. URtS new experimenttaI researches upper range, the correspondence is as goid as the delicacy of the experiments at such temperatures could permit us to expect. Thte experiments have been presented without modification. I must ow n, that when first the above perfect coincidence appeared, it gave me no small pleasure, as it led me to suppose that I had discovered the hidden chain of nature. In treating of the vapour of alcohol, Mr. DALTON consiL_ ders it as irregular in the progress of its elastic force by heat, owing to its not being a homogeneous liquid. He suspects " that the elastic force in this case is a mixture of aqueousand alcoholic vapour." I cannot see the cogency of this argument for, if the separate bodies have a regular pro. gression, the mixture ought not surely to be anomalous. I believe, however, that if the experiments were made with due accuracy, alcohol would be found as methodical in the elastic march of its vapour as other bodies. The following table will afford satisfactory proofs of the justness of these; views. For absolute alcohol, the progression is probably as simple as that of the preceding vapours& But for alcohol, sp. gr. o.8i, which though highly rectified, contains not a little water, we should expect it to result from a composition or modification of ratios. After some search on thisprinciple, I accordingly found it. Starting from the boiling point 174,a pr for the convenience of comparison with the table, from the decade 1700, we move not by a unit, as before, but by a unit and a tenth; or the initial ratio 1.26 is affected at each step or term .of iol, with the number + o.o ii, the signs being employed as in the preceding cases.. oz some of the leading doctrines of caloric, 365 TABLE V.

This may fairly be deemed the limit of accuracy in such an experiment. Oil of turpentine is regulated by the constant ratio .129, which converts any elastic force into that io above or below, multiplying as usual in the former, and dividing in the latter case. For petroleum the ratiois i . t; it is also constant. The following table exhibits a comparative view of theory and experiment. 366 ~Dr. UIE'S new experimen ta researches TABLE VI. Oil of Turpentine.

Mr. DALTON regards the progressive elasticities of aqueous and ethereal vapour as affording countenance, if not support, to his thermometric innovations. He affirms, that if our instrument for measuring heat were accommodated to his doctrine, the quantity of expansion of its mercury is as the square of the temperature from its freezing point; then " the force of " steam in contact with water increases accurately in geome. "trical progression to equal increments of temperature, provided these increments are measured by a thermometer of water or mercury, the scales of which are divided by "the above mentioned law."'* Were this position true, it would certainly bring a powerful analogy in aid of his theoretical views. We are now furnished with data to verify, or refute it. The following tables show the correspondence between that principle and experiment. In the table of aqueous vapour, the first column pre-* New System, vol. it p. x.X onz some of the leading doctrines of calorc, &c. 367 sents his geometrical progression of that vapour, co-ordinate with his equal intervals of real temperature contained in the second. In the third, are the corresponding points of the common scale, as given by Mr. DALTON. To these points the elastic forces, as determined by experiment, are placed opposite in the fourth column. Table second, for vapour of ether, is similarly arranged; the first three columns being Mr. DALTON'S; the fourth, the faithful transcript of observation. "The force of the vapour of sulphuric ether," says Mr. DALTON," in contact with liquid ether, is a geometrical procc gression, having a less ratio than that of water." "I Ether, "as manufactured in the large way, appears to be a very homogeneous liquid. I have purchased it in London, Edin"burgh, Glasgow, and Manchester, at different times, of "precisely the same quality in respect to its vapour. "i This shows that no exception can be made to my experiments on account of a supposed difference in the quality of the ether. From the mode of conducting my experiments there remained always a quantity of liquid ether in contact with the vapour, a circumstance essential to accuracy in this research. The results were verified by frequent repetitions, and discover, in my opinion, the consistency of truth.* New System, vol. i. pp, ZO, 7I. 368 Dr. URE'S new expernental researches TABLES VII.

Their differences, on the contrary, are prodigiously great. At 272? of his scale, for example, equal to 2960.2 of ours, the law of progression makes the elastic force of aqueous vapour amount to 1,58 inches : experiment gives 131.7; and I am confident, that the latter cannot be in error above anl inch or two. Again at 2620, equivalent to 2810.2 FAHRENHEIT, his theory gives the force of the same vapour at 120 inches; by observation it is only 103.5. Now at this part of the scale, my result is con. firmed by the concurrence of those obtained by BETANCOURT and RoBIsON. I consider this demonstration complete. If we compare these very elasticities of Mr. DALTON, with the table formerly given by the same philosopher,* we shall find* Manchester Memoirs, vol. 5. on some oJ the leading doctrines of caloric, &c. discordances which no ingenuity can harmonize. At that time, 22,f of FAHR. = 2220 of the new scale, gave a force of vapour equal to 38.3; it is now 39.5. 2520.6 F. 2420 D. then coincided with an elasticity of 58.6 inches; above, it is 69. And finally, 2810.2 F. 2620 D. were opposite to go inches; they have become here 12o. And yet no new experiments on the vapour of water have been adduced, to justify such immense alterations. It may be said, indeed, that these changes arise merely from the substitution of one hypothesis for another; but the deviations from experiment are even more remarkable, since as 2820 new scale, correspond to 31 1 *i5 FAHR., the difference amounts to 43 inches, being more than one fourth of the total elastic force generated at that high temperature. When we turn our attention to ether, we find the discrepancies, if possible, less easy to reconcile. At the temperature of 2129 , for example, where the old and new scales meet for the last time, the force of its vapour by the geometrical progression exceeds that found from experiment, by the enormous quantity of 67 inches and a half; amounting to two fifths of the whole elastic force evolved. May we venture, then, to conclude, from these multiplied comparisons, that the progressions of elasticity in vapours, taught by Mr. DALTON, are geometrical fictions, intended to quadrate with his notions concerning temperature; but not consonant with the laws or phenomena of nature? Within a moderate compass, indeed, it is not difficult to suit the ratio of elastic force and the thermometric graduation to each other; but the prosecution of the en'quiry into ranges mnore remote, detects the fallacy of such hypothetical adaptia 370 Dr. URE'S new experimental researches tions. My experiments on the vapours of water, alcohol and ether, seem to show, that the ratio of tension decreases in a certain progression as the temperature augments. Were the ratios 1.23, 1.92.22,1.21, &c., which are seen to apply so well to aqueous vapour for a considerable range above 212o, to be adopted as representing the progressive march of nature, it would lead to the absurd conclusion, that at 94e above the boiling point, or 4$2? F., the farther influx of caloric would occasion a diminution of elasticity in the steam. The truth however is, that at the 3i?th degree, indications of a divergence begin to appear between the two lines of experiment and calculation, which had run for so long a space nearly parallel. The curve representing the expansive force of steam, I consider to be logarithmic, in which the ratios, as ordinates, continually diminish, without ever vanishing, or coming to an equality. The axis is an asymptote to the curve, as in the atmospherical logarithmic. CHAPTER IIL On thermometric admeasurement, and the doctrine of capacity. Before inquiring into the relative quantities of heat, contained in different vapours at the same tension, it will be proper to determine the primary and fundamental proposition concerning the measure of temperature. It is singular, that not one experimental fact has been advanced, capable of settling this question, amid the contending opinions of chemi. cal philosophers. Mr. DALTON has in particular, exerted all the resources of his genius and science to destroy our confidence in the thermometric scale; our sole guide in the vast on some of the leading doctrines of caloric, &c. 371 and intricate province of caloric. While I hope to be able to fix this now indeterminate point, by a new train of investiga-. tions, and consequently to prove the entire fallacy of his doctrine of temperature, the key-stone of his system of heat, I do not mean to affirm the absolute uniformity of expansion in bodies, by equal increments of that power. I think it indeed highly probable, that every species of matter, both solid and liquid, follows an increasing rate in its enlargement by caloric. Each portion that enters into a body must weaken the antagonist force, cohesion; and must therefore render more efficacious the operation of the next portion that is introduced. Let iooo represent the cohesive attraction at the commencement; then, after receiving one increment of caloric it will become iooo -1= 999. Since the next unit of that divellent agent will have to combat only this diminished cohesive force, it will produce an effect greater than the first, in the proportion of loco to 999; and so on in continued progression. That the increasing ratio is however, greatly less than Mr. DALTON maintains, may, I think, be clearly demonstrated. According to his table of equal increments of temperature, vol 1. p. 14a, New System, we have the following intervals, corresponding to the five successive intervals of g90 on our scale. From 820 to 1920Y to 212%, to 3O20, to 3920, to 40829. Intervals by FAHR. Of 900,o, g O g O 900,9Q. True intervals by DALTON, 1O2~4 77?.6 630.9 550.7 5 The relative inequality of these intervals is deduced from Mr. DALTON'S law, that "all pure homogeneous liquids, as "water and mercury, expand from the point of their congelaMDCCCXVIII. 3 C Dr. URE'S neW experimental researches "tion, or greatest density, a quantity always as the square "of the temperature from that point." He regards the law as resulting from the constitution of liquids, and therefore not applicable to solid bodies. This is indeed implied in its enunciation. In P. 43, after assigning reasons, he states, "that for all practical purposes we may adopt the notion of "the equable expansion of solids." Now I am prepared to prove, either, that the expansion of solids partakes of the above inequability of liquids, which nobody imagines, and for which no reason, even hypothetical, can be assigned; or, which is the only alternative, that homogeneous solids, and mercury, proceed almost exactly, par passu, in their rates of expansion by heat. The experiments which justify this assertion were made by me about five years ago, and were then exhibited to many of my chemical friends, as also in my public lectures; but a wish to render the series more complete, has induced me to withhold them from the public eye, till requisite leisure could be afforded for this purpose. They were performed with a pyrometer of peculiar construction, in an oblong trough filled with melting ice: a strong bar of Swedish iron was placed, from which projected at right angles, four inflexible iron arms, attachable by powerful screws to any part of the bar. The arms nearest the extremities of the bar, carried each a fine micrometer microscope, made by that admirable artist Mr. TROUGHTON. The other two arms were incurvated downwards at their extremities, which supported a metallic or other rod. This was fixed by two pinching screws at one end, but lay loose on a friction roller at the other. The loose end bore an elevated index. The curvature of these two arms was on some of the leading doctrines of caloric, &c. 873 such as to allow their extremities, with the attached rod, to be plunged beneath the surface of oil or water, about an inch, contained in a copper trough. This was Placed parallel to the large trough, and a'few inches distant from it. The copper vessel was slowly and equably heated, by a series of argand lamps placed beneath. One micrometer watched a point projecting from the arm that held the fixed extremity of the rod. The oil was carefully agitated during the application of the heat; and the bulbs of three thermometers, mutually comparable, were immersed into it at regular distances. The micrometers were screened from the influence of the heat. They rendered the of an inch discernible, and even a smaller quantity, by an experienced eye. 'A rod of pure Swedish iron, or of such pure copper as jewellers use for alloying gold, being adjusted to the apparatus, the point on the micrometer scale, that appeared a tangent to the small luminous aperture in the thin index plate of steel, was noted down, when the liquid in the trough was at ?.3 The value and truth of the micrometrical indications had been previously ascertained, by viewing through the microscopes a given surface or aperture, moved laterally so as to make its image successively coincide with the different points of the interior notched scale'. Heat being now applied, the progressive march of the index across the field of view of the micrometer microscope was closely observed, and its position written down at intervals of loc or Poe of the FAHR. thermometer. But as the pyrometrical details will appear in a separate memoir on the expansions of bodies, I shall state here merely what concerns the present subject. g374 DDr URE'S new expermental researches If we denominate the absolute elongation of the heated metallic rod from sOt to 1i 2', io, then its elongation from i ?20 to 2129; from 2120 to 302 ; from 302? to 392i'; from f9e to 4820, was in each successive interval of 9Q F. as nearly as possible io also. The slight irregularities, incident to all delicate experimental investigations, being often in opposite directions, in different repetitions of the same experiment; or those which manifested themselves in the ascending or elongating range, were neutralized, so to speak, by others of an inverse nature, which appeared in the cooling retrocession. Here, the movements of the liquid mercury and of the solid rod by heat proceeded,paripassu, through a very great extent of temperature. Let us now recollect that these 5 increments, which on our thermometer are equivalent to 5 x 9Q0 = 4500; and which altogether produce five times the elongation that the first interval occasions, constitute, on Mr. DALTON'S scale, only &5oQ. If we call the first interval given by this philosopher 1.oo, then the four succeeding intervals contain a range of temperature on his scheme, of only two and a half times the first ; and therefore only two and a half times additional elongation should have been produced, instead of four times, as found by experiment. c Since for all practical purposes uniform increments of bulk, or expansions of solids by heat, correspond to uniform increments of this power ;," then each of our old successive intervals of go9 may, for all practical purposes, be held to correspond to equal increments of temperature. Mr. DALTON'S intervals from 320 to 4820 FAHR. are as before given,0 io2.4; 77?.6; 630.9; 550*7; 500.5 3500.1.1 Now, if we call the first quantity ixooj it will produce on a on some of the leading doctrines of caloric, &c. 375 metallic rod a corresponding effect in expansion =1.oo. The next interval of Mr. DALTON'S scale (equal always to goo FA HR. ) can produce only 4. of the effect of the first, or as 75 to 100. The third, fourth, and fifth intervals will give the fractional expansions in reference to the first, of A, 4, and about , or merely a half. No such diminution of effect was observed in the experiments; from 39X2 to 48?? F., the rod elongated as much as from 3e? 1220, or double the quantity compatible with the DALTONIAN hypothesis. Thus therefore we have a rigid, and I think unanswerable demonstration of the general correctness of the common scale of temperature, and of the extreme inaccuracy and inapplicability of Mr. DALTON'S geometrical substitute. Should the preceding statement leave any doubt or obscurity concerning the legitimacy of the inference now drawn I trust it will be entirely removed, when the details of the experiments are published, with drawings of the apparatus, in my treatise on pyrometry. Yet though the mercury in the thermometer tube move, parn passu with a metallic rod, deemed uniform in its expansion, it does not prove perfectly equal uniformity of expansion to belong to the mercury. It will seem, no doubt, a paradoxical assertion, that of two bodies marching together, hand in hand, one of them may have an equable pace, while that of the other is regularly, but very slowly accelerated. Yet I think the position just. It proceeds from a circumstance in the thermometer sufficiently obvious, but which seems to have escaped our systematic writers. I do not rest the proposition on any imperfection of workmanship, or supposed irregularity in the expansions of the glass 376 Dr. URx's new experimental researches Let us take a thermometer, the calibre of whose stem is perfectly uniform, and whose scale -is exactly divided. Lt it have a range from -zero to the 656th degree, at which mercury boils, by the accurate experiments of CREUGHroN. At 320, let the mercury stand at the bottom of the ivory scale, where of course the graduations commence. The bare part of the instrument is consequently the plunging limit, in most chemical researches on the temperature of liquids. Immerse the bulb in common oil, or oil of vitriol heated to SiS? ' * part of the whole included mercury, will now ascend above that part of the stem plunged in the liquid. The part actually exposed to the heat, and by whose expansion the column on the scale is supported is only gf of the initial mass. Augment the heat of the oil till the instrument indicate 39sO; we know that there remains now, under the immediate influence of the heat, fjnearly of the original weight of mercury; and finally) at ;572, only -about 3 rest in the immersed part of the stem and bulb. or , parts may be considered as no longer subjected to the power of caloric. If the thermometer stem were recurved near the bulb, the mercury in the stem placed horizontally would be cold; and this proposition would be almost exactly true. Now, since the calibre and divisions are uniform, the capacity of the tube from the point marked 212?, to that marked .gg0; and again from this, to that opposite to 7s?' is in each equal ,to its capacity from 320 to 2ga. Hence these three equal capacities are filled by the expansions of the three unequal quantities of mercury 62, 6X, 6o. At the * A minute fraction less; but we need not complicate the sutement with it. on some of the leading doctrines of caloric, &c. 877 highest station, the column of quicksilver equal on the stem to, 3 x 1800, is sustained by the expansion of Go parts; at the middle point, 2 x i8o4 is supported by that of 6i; and at 2120 there are 62 parts of mercury to sustain 18o0 in the tube. Or, to put it in another form, these three successive spaces on the scale are equal ; the first portion of mercury is protruded into it by the expansion of 69 parts in the bulb; the second portion by the expansion of 6i; and the third by that of Go. Thereforeif these three thermometric intervals of 1800, each of which holds an equal measure of mercury, contain also equal increments of temperature, as denoted by the equal increments of a metallic rod; then, these three equal effects are produced from the unequal quantities of mercury 629,61, 6o. This liquid, then, must have an increasing rate of expansion, the inverse of these numbers, for every 1800 of the scale, or A, air 4 That is to say, 6o parts at 5702 do the same work by the same power of caloric, as 6i at 3920, and 6s at I believe this to be the real nature of mercurial expansion, and the true condition of the thermometer; which is an equable measurer of heat, because the mercury possesses the above increasing rate of expansion. Were the mercury, on the contrary, absolutely uniform in its augmentations of volume by equal increments of heat, then for an instrument whose bulb alone in practice can be immersed, the three above ranges should have the corresponding parts of the scale shortened in the successive proportions of 62 to 6,; 6i to 6s; and 6o to 63; quantities taken together nearly equal to 90, or = x Ex So Dr. URE'S new experimental researches Whatever reception these speculations may experience,, they must not bee confounded with the experiments on the expansions of metallic rods, and the corollaries, which have, a distinct and independent existence. ? II. On the doctrines of capacity, as connected with the preceding znvestigation. Dr. CRAWFORD and DE Luc, tried to verify the justness of the thermometric indications, by mixing together wrater at 219" and 320; when the former found 1220, and the latter 19?, to be the resulting temperature. DE Luc's number is 0 below the mean; Dr. CRAWFORD'S is exact. This ingenious philosopher afterwards sought to confirm the evidence thus given to the accuracy of the scale, by other experiments, which were however of rather, an equivocal import. Both of the above results have been condemned and rejected by Mr. DALTON: he states the true mean temperature to be not 1 22, nor even 1190, but lo0. For this deviation, the reasons which he assigns appear, independently of all arguments derived from other quarters, to be in themselves inconclusive. He says,-" the temperature of the above mixture ought to be found above the mean 1i2n." " Water of these two tempe. "ratures (320 and ?912) being mixed, loses about ' of its "bulk. This condensation of its volume* must expel a quantity of heat, and raise the temperature above the mean." p. 7. Again, p. So " that water increases in its "capacity for heat with the increase of temperature, Icon"c sider demonstrable from the following arguments. ist.

Admitting the force of these "arguments, it follows, that when water of 32' and ?120 are "mixed, and give a temperature denoted by 1i9i of the "common thermometer, we must conclude that the true mean temperature is somewhere below that degree. I have already assigned the reason why I place the mean at i Now the only reason I can elsewhere find, is derived from his general law," that all homogeneous liquids expand, as the square of the temperature, fromn the point of greatest density or congelation." In p. 7, hie ventures to assert nothing more than), " that it is not improbable that the true mean tempe"rature between 32'0 and 212', may be as low as 1o0o FAR"RENHEIT. Satisfied from my pyrometrical experiments, that his general hypothesis of the expansion of liquids being as tile * For the entire fallacy of this reasonings see my Essay just quoted; expansion of volume should by Mr. D. increase capacity and diminish temperature. The very revers is shown in that paper. MDCCCXVIT 3 D 380 Dr. URE'S new experzmental researches square of their temperature, is totally Inapplicable to mercury, the inference relative to the thermometric mean between ro and 9120 cannot be allowed. But let us examine, on their own merits the preceding arguments against Dr. CRAWFORD and DE Luc's verification of the mean temperature between that of freezing and boiling water. The reasoning derives its sole force from the assumption, that the capacity of water for heat increases as its temperature is raised. There is adduced, however, no fact in the least decisive on this main point. What analogy is there between the entire change of form and constitution suffered by an incondensible liquid, on becoming an elastic vapour, and the progressive heating of the liquid itself? Or, although dilute sulphuric acid and other liquids should increase in their specific caloric on being heated, which however has not been satisfactorily demonstrated, are we to assert that water must do so too.? It is a matter of surprize to me, that a philosopher of Mr. DALTON's judgement and acuteness should have pressed such inconclusive analogies into his service. He knew wvell that water is endowed with some curious peculiarities, when compared with other liquids, or anomalies, as we idly stile them ; for they constitute no anomaly in nature, but wisely fit water for performing the important functions assigned to it in the economy of our globe. In a series of experiments, carefully conducted on the relative capacities for heat, of water, sulphuric acid, oil of turpentine, and spermaceti oil, published in my Essay on hydrochloric acid and the chlorides; it seems to be directly demonstrated that the specific heat of water does not increase, but actually diminishes, and that very conspicuously, as its of some of the leading doctrines of caloric, &c. 8 temperature rises. It is there proved, that from 2100 to 5osp FAHR. the specific heat of oil is to that of water as 697 to 100o; and from 1500 to goo as 513 to 1ooo. The same proportional difference of relation is exhibited by the other two liquids. Now, were the phenomenon occasioned by the oil of vitriol, common oil, and oil of turpentine, increasing in their capacities for heat in a still more rapid ratio than water, we should undoubtedly expect, from the innate differences between the specific heats of these three substances, to find that they would move independently on each other, or at different rates. But their uniform advance together, while water alone varies in this respect, shows distinctly, that in the water resides the cause of the variation. This reasoning may be illustrated in many ways, but by nothing more clearly than the exploded astronomical system of the diurnal and annual movements of the sun and fixed stars; in support of which, very extravagant hypotheses had to be contrived. The single fact of the motion of the earth once admitted, reduced the PTOLEMAIC chaos to order. If, in like manner, we should suppose an increasing ratio in the specific heat of water, then we must also suppose a much more rapid increase in the ratios of the above three substances although their individual specific heats are greatly inferior to that of water. Ought -not that body, which has of all others the most decided relation to heat, or highest specific heat, to have also its ratio most decidedly or rapidly augmented ? In adopting the increasing specific heat of water, we must farther assume, that, however different the initial specific heats of the above three liquids may -be, yet, while they possess all the same rate of increase, water alone has a different one; an inadmissible supposition. All 882 Dr. URELS new experimental researches these difficulties and contradictions are removed at once by the experimental fact, that water is endowed with a decreasing ratio in its capacity for caloric, as its temperature is augmented. Since finishing the above researches on specific heat, I have been led to examine attentively the systematic accounts of this subject in our chemical treatises ; and I find that BERTHOLLET, with a sagacity peculiar to himself, had anticipated, from the chemical constitution of bodies, such are experimental result as I have recently obtained; though the statements then prevalent all militated against his views. c If caloric cs obey the usual laws of attraction, when it is in small cc quantity, relative to the body to which it is u4nited, it will 's enter into more intimate combination and hence the elase 15 ticity or expansive energy of it, on which temperature "de-pnds, :may be overcome, and a larger quantity be required "to produce a given temperature. Hence the quantity of cc caloric contained in bodies in the first stage of temperature, " may be greater than it will be higher in the scale.," In the Essay above referred to I have shown that this circumstance in water, renders it peculiarly qualifiedl for serving as the magazine and equalizer of t' e temperature of the globe. Since at our ordinary atmo s;herical heats, it poss ssesses the greatest capacity for caloric, small variations in its temrperature give it a great mondifyig power over the circu iamWeent air. Although the doctrine of final causes be no safe guide to the discovery of unknown truths, yet vhlen ft concurs with experiment, we may deem -it an agreeable confirmation. This i finely illustrated by Count RUMFORD'S pspecuaations on the maximum density of water being placed on some of the leading doctrines of caloric, &c. 383 several degrerabove its point of congelation; a fact which does not hold with regard to any other homogeneous liquid. If tf-ie specific heat of water, then, diminish as its temperature advances from the freezing to the boiling point, an interval of 1o0 near 32O, will contain more caloric than ten degi ees near i 2e aid still more than the same intervals near 2120. On this principle we can readily account for the results obtained by Mr. DALTON, in mixing with water at different temperatures a known proportion of ice ; though it is remarkable that this able chemist did not see in them any thing inconsistent with his own opposite views upon specific heat. 1s 760.5 expresses the number of degrees of temperature, "such as are found between 2000 and 2 12? of the old orcommon scale, entering into ice of 320, to convert it into water of 320 ; 15o0 of the same scale suffice, he says, for the same effect, between t2 ? and 1 0?: and between 450 and 50?, 1280 are "x adequate to the conversion of the same ice into water. "These three resulting numbers (1 28, 150, j 76.,5) are nearly as I, 6, 7. Hence it follows, that as much heat is necessary "to raise water g" in the lower part of the old scale, as is "required to raise it 70 in the higher, and 6 i'n the middle."* Mr. DALTON, instead of adopting thie obvious conclusion, that the capacity of water for heat is greater at lower than it is at higher temperatures, and that therefore a smaller number of degrees of the former should melt as much ice as a greater number of the latter, ascribes the deviation denoted by thesenumbers, or their differences, to the gross errors of our thermometric graduation; which he considers' New System, vol. I. p. i. 384 Dr. URE'S new experimental researches so excessive, as not only to equal, but greatly to overbalance the real increase in the specific heat of water; which left-to its own operation, would have produced, opposite experimental results.'That our thermometric scale has no such prodigious deviation from truth, or uniformity of indication, I conceive to be fully established, and therefore the only legitimate inference from these very experiments of Mr. DALTON, is the decreasing capacity of water with the increase of its tem-. perature. It deserves to be remarked, that my experiments on the relative times of cooling a globe of glass, successively filled with water, oil of vitriol, common oil, &c. give exactly the, same results as Mr. DALTON derived from mixtures of 2 ounces of ice and 6o of water. This concurrence is the more satisfactory, since}, hen the Essay on hydrochloric acid was written, I had no recollection of Mr. DALTON'S experiments. I found that from 210e to 1500 the specific heat of oil bears to that of water the ratio of S97 to iooo; and from 15oP to 9g', that of 513 to 0ooo. Now, at his highest and middle temperatures of 200 and 1200, which come nearest to mine of 180o and 120o, we have by him the ratio of 1760.5 to 1Se. But 597 : 513:: 176: 15o exactly, which is a very striking coincdence, and affords the happiest confirmation of the accuraxcyof both sets of experiments, as well as of the just;. ness of the principles on which they were conducted, and on which, particularly my reductions were founded. We now see the reason why, when equal weights of water at 3%0 and S212 are mixed, the temperature may be below the mean, as was found by DE Luc. The capacity at the middle tempe. on some of the leading doctrines of caloric, &c. 385 rature, is greater than the mean capacity of the two extremes, (that is of the ingredients mixed, ice, cold and boiling water) and therefore the thermometric tension will be lessened, and its mercury will descend on the scale.* This diminution of temperature will cause a corresponding diminution of bulk, which affords a complete answer to Mr. DALTON'S first and only plausible argument, formerly quoted against Dr. CRAWFORD'S deductions and the opinions of DE Luc. With regard, however, to these experiments, of mixing hot and cold water to find a mean temperature, there are sufficient difficulties to render the result uncertain to ? or 3 degrees. Hence, nothing of moment can safely be inferred from them. Concerning sulphuric acid in its various states of dilution, I beg to refer the reader to my Essay on the subject, where he will find several peculiarities relative to its volume at dif. ferent acid strengths, that entirely change its relations to caloric. I have not seen these formerly adverted to by any chemist. They were evidently unknown to Mr. DALTON. CHAPTER III. On the latent heat oJ diferent vapours. What relation is there between the caloric existing in the vapours of different substances, and the temperatures at which they respectively acquire the same elastic force ? On this subject I am not acquainted with any preceding inquiries, though a question of such interest has probably not escaped examination. * Taking Mr. DALTON'S three numbers s correct: then 176.5 + 2 _ 2. But j5oP in the middle are equal to the former mean of the two. Hence, the proposition in the text is demonstrated. 8386 Dr. URE'S new experimental researches In this research I employed a very simple apparatus; and with proper management, I believe it capable of giving the absolute quantities of latent heat in different vapours, as exactly as more refined and complicated mechanisms. At any rate, it will afford comparative results with great precision. It consisted of a glass retort of very small dimensions, with a short neck inserted into a globular receiver of very thin glass, and : about three inches in diameters The globe was surrounded with a certain quantity of water at a known temperature, contained in a glass basin. 200 grains of the liquid, whose vapour was to be examined, were introduced into the retort, and rapidly distilled into the globe by the heat of an argand lamp. The temperature of the air was 45, that of the water in the basin from 42' to 43, and the rise of temperature occasioned by the condensation of the vapour, never exceeded that of the atmosphere by 4 degrees. By these means, as the communication of heat is very slow between bodies which differ little in temperature, I found, that the air could exercise no perceptible influence on the water in the basin during the experiment, which was always completed in 5 or 6 minutes. A thermometer of great deli' cacy was continually moved through the waterl and its indications were read off, by the aid of a lens, to small fractions of a degree. In all the early experiments of Dr. BLACK on the latent heat of common steam, the neglect of the above precautions introduced material errors into the estimate. Hence that distinguished philosopher found the latent heat of steam to be no more than 8oo0 or 8io'. Mr. WATT afterwards deters on some of the leading doctrines of caloric, &c. 387 mined it more nearly from goo9 to 9500; and LAVOISIER and LA PLACE have made it iooo0. It is evident that whenever the water, into which the latent heat is evolved by condensation of the vapour, becomes much hotter than the surrounding air, it will be impossible to ascertain how much of the caloric is dissipated; and consequently, the true quantity contained in the vapour must remain uncertain. The sources of error in operating with the calorimeter of LAVoISIER and LA PLACE, were first pointed out by Mr. WEDGWOOD, and have been since commented on bv Dr. THOMSON, and other good systematists. It is said to be difficult to obtain precisely uniform quantities of liquified ice in the repetition of the same experirnents, with that celebrated apparatus. From the smallness of the retort in my mode of proceeding, the shortness of the neck, and its thorough insertion into the globe, we prevent condensation by the air in transitu ; while the surface of the globe and the mass of water being great, relative to the quantity of vapour employed, the heat is entirely transferred to the refrigeratory, where it is allowed to retmain, without apparent diminution, for a few minutes. In numerous repetitions of the sa'me experiment, the accordances were excellent. The following table contains the mean results. The water in the basin weighed in each case 32340 gr. The glE be was held steadily in the centre of the water by a slender ring fixed round its neck. The distillation was rapidly performed so that all the condensation took place in the globe.

Hence, when their tension is the same, it appears reasonable to suppose that the product of their densities into their quan.. tities of latent heat will also be the same. Repulsive energy 390 Dr. URE'S new experimental researches will be proportional to the quantity of heat, the repulsive power condensed or contained in a given space. Thus if the pace left forits interposition or lodgmnent be in one vapImr a half or a third of the amount of the space in another, we ought to find equal tension produced in the former case, by a half or a third of the latent heat required for the latter. As the principle, I have reason to suppose, is somewhat new, let us illustrate it by an applhcation to the three vapours in the above list which are most homogeneous, or at, any rate best understood; those of alcohol, ether, and water. Aqueous vapour of an elastic force balancing the atmospheric pressure has a specific gravity, compared to air, by the accurate experiments of GAY LuSSAC, Of 10 to 16. For facility of comparison let us call the steam of water unity, or i.oo; then the specific gravity of the vapour of pure ether is 4.00, while the specific gravity of the vapour of absolute alcohol is 2.6o. But the vapour of ether, whose boiling point is not 1OO , but 112 , like the above ether, contains some a1cohol ; hence, we must accordingly diminish a little the specific gravity of its vapour. It wvill then become instead of 400 355 Alcohol of o.825 sp. gr. contains much water; specific gravity of its vapour 2.30 That of water as before, unity 1.00 The interstitial spaces in these three vapours will therefore be inversely as these numbers, or X3 for ether; 23 for alcohol; X forwater, 3T55 230 100 on some of the leading doctrines of caloric, &c. Hence .iof latent heat, existing in ethereal vapour, will 35 5 occupy a proportional space, be equally condensed or possess the same tension with 230 in alcoholic, and X2,,, in aqueous vapour. A small modification will no doubt be introduced by the difference of the ithermometric tensions, or sensible heats, under the same elastic force. Common steam, for example, may be considered as deriving its total elastic energy from the latent heat multiplied into the specific gravity + the thermometric tension. Hence the elastic force of water, or Ems = 970 x .oo + 2I20 1182 e =3002 x .55 + Il2? 84 Eal -440 X 2.30 + 17' -185 Three equations which yield, according to my general proposition, equal quantities; or of which the differences are inconsiderable, and undeserving of notice. Neither the specific heats nor specific gravities of the other vapours are ascertained with sufficient precision to enable us to subject them to calculation. General equation F +T =:o: L, latent heat, D, Genera equaion FL xC D a t T > ,ltn 0tD density, T, temperature corresponding to F. When the elastic forces of vapours are doubled, or when they sustain a double pressure, their interstices are proportions ally diminished. We may consider them now as in the condition of vapours possessed of greater specific gravities. Hence, the second portion of heat introduced to give double the 39X Dr. URE'S new experimental researches elastic force need not be equal to the first, in order to produce the double tension. This view now given accords with the experiments of Mr. WATT, alluded to in the beginning of this memoir. He found that "t the latent heat of steam is less when it is produced under a greater pressure or in a more dense state; and greater when it is produced under a less pressure or in a less dense state."* BERTHOLLET thinks this fact so unaccountable, that he has been willing to discard it altogether. Whether the view which I have just opened, of the relation subsisting between the elastic force, density, and latent heat of different vapours, harmonize with chemical phenomena in general, I leave to others to determine. It certainly agrees with that unaccount able fact. Whatever be the fate of the investigation of the general law now respectfully offered, the statement of Mr. WATT may be implicitly received under the sanction of his acknowledged sagacity and candour. CONCLUSION. To the theory of latent heat, which, like the hydrostatic. paradox of Archimedes, might have remained for ages a barren, though beautiful proposition, the fertile genius of that philosopher gave all at once its noblest application, and most beneficial influence on human life, by his new steam engine. After him, many minds of the first order for science and ingenuity have offered schemes of farther improvement;* Philos. Trans. vol. 84. p. 335. on some of the leading doctrines of caloric, &c. but all either frivolous or abortive; with such prophetic judgment had Mr. WATT anticipated the happiest form and structure of which it was susceptible. Under this conviction, it is with much deference that I draw the following practical inferences from the last train of experiments. Since the vapour of alcohol, having the same elastic force as the atmosphere, contains -44-. of the latent heat of ordinary steam, and since its elastic force is doubled at the 206th degree (6? below the boiling heat of water), with perhaps i of additional caloric; might wenot,in particular circumstances, employ this vapour for impelling the piston of a steam engine ? The condensing apparatus could, I imagine, be so constructed, as to prevent any material loss of the liquid, while more than a quadruple power would be obtained from the same size of cylinder at ste, with an expenditure of fuel not amounting to one half of what aqueous vapour consumes; or the power and fuel would be as 3 to 1, calling their relation in ordinary steam i to 1. A considerable engine could thus also be brought within a very moderate compass. Possibly, after a few operations of the air pump, the incon,densible gas may be so effectually withdrawn, that we might be permitted to detach this mechanism, which, though essential to common engines, takes away one fourth of their power. In a distillery in this country, or on a sugar estate in the colonies, a trial of this plan might perhaps be made with advantage. While exercising its mechanical functions of grinding, mashing or squeezing the canes, it would be converting ordinary into strong spirit for rectification, or for Dr. URt'S new experimental researches & the convenience of carriage. Might not such an engine be executed on a small scale, for many purposes of domestic drudgery? It would unquestionably furnish a beautiful illustration in philosophy, to make one small portion of liquid, by the agency of fire, imitate the ceaseless circulation and restless activity of life.
