An Account of the same Comet; by Nicolas Munckley, of Lincoln's-Inn, Esq; JAnuary 9, 1760, I observed what appeared to me to be evidently a comet, west of the constellation of Orion, or (to speak more astronomically and exactly) over the two stars marked ~ and ~ in the river Eridanus, but nearer the latter than the former; right ascension, about 66 deg. declination, about 3 deg. S. It was something dimmer and larger than either of these stars; and through a telescope, appeared magnified, and surrounded with a broad, faint, ill-defined haziness, like the last comet, such as plainly distinguished it from any V O L.

It seemed, even between the times I observed it that evening, to have a sensible motion towards the north-west (i. e. nearer the zenith, and contrary to the order of the signs): for though at first I apprehend its place to be as above, on reviewing it, two or three hours afterwards, it was more over the star v, and a little to the westward of it. This phaenomenon was seen the night before (viz. the 8th, when I was in London), by two or three persons, who mentioned it to me: but though they particularly took notice of it as different from other stars, they were not astronomers enough to give any exact account, either of its place or appearance. The evenings following the 9th were cloudy, till the 13th, which, though far from being very clear, allowed me however, at times, to see the constellation Orion, and westward of it, as far as Cetus, &c. I saw particularly the stars ~ and v, mentioned before, and the places above-referred to over them; but I saw nothing any more of the comet. Hampstead, Nicolas Munckley. XLIV. An
