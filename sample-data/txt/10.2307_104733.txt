[647] XXVI. Extract of a Letter from Portsmouth; communicated by Daniel Wray Esq; F. R. S. concerning the same. March 19, 1749. Y E S T E R D A Y, about a Quarter before Six in the Evening, a slight Shock of an Earthquake was felt here. I don't find it was general, as many People felt nothing of it. It was felt sensibly at Mr. Carter's and Mr. Taylor's; so that it is something more than Fancy. Read March 22. 1749. P. S. Since writing the above, I am told the Shock was very violently felt in the Isle of Wight Yesterday.
