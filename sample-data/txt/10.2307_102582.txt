To the Right Honourable J O H N Lord S O M M E R S, Lord High Chancellor of England, President of the R O Y A L S O C I E T Y: May it please your Lordship, THE Royal Society of London, Instituted to promote Arts, and Sciences, observing your Lordships great Learning and Goodness, did themselves the Honour to Choose your Lordship their President, which your Lordship condescended to accept of. Your Lordship has since been pleased to shew them many Marks of your Favour and Protection, and to preside in their Assembly. These Honours which come from your desire to encourage all useful Learning, has animated the Society so much, that their Meetings have been more frequented, their Correspondence at Home and Abroad enlarged, and many things have been added to the History of Art and Nature. These Papers, which are a small part of what came before them last Year, I presume to present to your Lordship, not doubting but your Lordship, who [* R r r] is D E D I C A T I O N. is so great a Judge of all sorts of Undertakings of this kind, will favourably accept of the good endeavours of a few Men who spend some of their Time, Thoughts, and Money, only to aim at the forwarding useful Knowledge, and hoping that your Lordship will please to pass by many Faults incident to Human Nature. I need not tell your Lordship, who knows so much, that our Sences are not able to attain to the Knowledge, nor our Reason to Comprehend the Causes of many things which we daily see; but there is great Usefulness and Pleasure in the Pursuit of Natural Inquiries, more than equals the Trouble of the Undertaking, and the Contempt or Pleasantry of the Malicious and Ignorant. Much should be here said in acknowledgment of your Lordships Favours, but I rather choose to desist, where I must come far short of your Lordships deserts, and the Sence of the Society of them, and therefore shall only beg leave to add that I am Your Lordships most Obedient and Dutiful ~, Hans Sloane, Soc.
