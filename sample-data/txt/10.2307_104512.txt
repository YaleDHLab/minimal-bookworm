An Account of some human Bones incrusted with Stone, now in the Villa Ludovisia at Rome: communicated to the Royal Society by the President, with a Drawing of the same. SOMETHING like the Body of a petrified Man being mentioned by several Authors, as preserved in the Villa Ludovisia at Rome, and the same having been rately referred to in a Discourse read before this Society; I thought, that a Drawing of that Curiosity, which I procured at Rome some Years since, might, possibly deserve the Read Dec. 12. 1745. [558] the Notice of the Gentlemen here present: especially, as it will appear thereby, that the several Accounts hitherto given of it are not very accurate, or, at the best, convey but a very imperfect Idea of the Truth. The following Passage occurs in the Journal-Book of the Society, for the 17th Day of April 1689: `` Mr. Henshaw related, that he had seen, in the Villa `` Ludovisia at Rome, the Body of a Man incrusted `` with a sort of a white Marble or Alabaster Case, `` supposed to have been a Man frozen in the Alps, `` and after, in long Process of Time, this Incrusta`` tion to have grown upon him; and that one of `` his Arms was broken off, purposely to shew, that `` it was no Imposition.'' Mr. Richard Lassels, in his Travels to Italy, printed at Paris 1670. pag. 180. tells us, that in the lesser Casina, belonging to the Ludovisian Villa, he saw, `` in a great square Box lined with Velvet, the Body `` of a petrified Man, that is, a Man turned into `` Stone; one Piece of the Leg (broken off to assure `` an Embassador doubting of the Verity of the Thing) `` shewed plainly both the Bone and the Stone crusted `` over it. The Head and the other Parts lie jumbled `` up together in the Box.'' Father Athanasius Kircher says, in his Mundus Subterraneus, l. viii. chap. 2. `` Spectatur et hic Romae in `` horti Ludovisiani palatio, corpus humanum totum `` in saxum conversum, ossibus adhuc integris, at la`` pideo cortice obductis.'' And in the following Page he gives an imperfect Sketch of the same thing, under the Title of `` Sceleton humani corporis in `` saxum conversum, ex palatio Pinciano principis `` Ludovisii.'' This Sketch, however imperfect, gives a [559] a truer Idea than either his or Mr. Lassels's Words seem to convey, as there is indeed nothing like the Body of a Man, but only a Cluster of disjointed Bones cemented together by the same Matter that incrusts them over. Mr. Misson in his Travels has more truly described them, when he says, that `` in the same `` Room they shew a small Heap of Bones, said to `` be the Sceleton of a petrified Man; which is a `` Mistake, for the Bones themselves are not petrified, `` but there has gather'd about them a sort of candied `` Crust, or stony Incrustation, which has made them `` pass for being of real Stone.'' Mr. Wright also, in his late Observations made in travelling through Italy, &c. has taken notice, that in the Villa Ludovisia `` they shew'd some Bones of a human Body all `` crusted over with a petrified Substance.'' When I was at Rome in the Year 1734, I myself saw this Curiosity, which is still preserved in the same Casina of the Ludovisian Gardens; and in the very square Box lined with Velvet, that is mentioned by Mr. Lassels, and represented by Father Kircher: and as I had before heard it much spoken of, and had conceived an Idea of it very different from the Truth, I was willing both to preserve a true Notion of it myself, and to be able to give such a one to others. I therefore employed an ingenious young Painter to make as exact a Drawing of it as he could; and I afterwards very carefully compared his Drawing with the Original, which is the same I have here to produce, hoping that the Sight of it will not be unacceptable to the Company. The stony Substance that joins the Bones together is of a whitish Colour, and the same as that which incrusts the Bones themselves: small Fractures [560] Fractures in several Places discover the natural Bones; and the Size of the whole Mass may be judged of, by considering the Scull, which is of the common Dimensions, as a Scale to the other Parts.
