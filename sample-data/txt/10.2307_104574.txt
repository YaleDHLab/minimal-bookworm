VI. A Letter from Rich. Hassel Esq; F. R. S. to Peter Daval Esq; Secr. R. S. concerning a large Piece of a Lath being thrust into a Man's Eye, who recover'd of it. S I R, I THOUGHT the following Case so extraordinary as to be worth the Notice of the Royal Society. If you think so too, I beg you to communicate it. Read Nov. 10. 1748. On Sunday the 17th of Jan. 1747. Henry Halsey, of South Mims, Labourer, thrust a long Lath with great Violence into the great Canthus of the left Eye of Edward Roberts of the same Place Labourer, which broke off quite short; so that a Piece two Inches and near a half long, half an Inch wide, and above a quarter of an Inch thick, (see T A B. 1.) remained in his Head,and was so deeply buried there,that it could searce be [521] be seen, or laid hold of. He rode with the Piece of Lath in him from Kick's End, where the thing was done, to Barnet, which is above a Mile, to the House of Mr. Justinian Morse, a Surgeon there, who extracted it with Difficulty; it sticking so hard, that others had been baffled in attempting to extract it. Roberts continued dangerously ill a long time; but at last, by the Blessing of God, and the Care of Mr. Morse, recover'd intirely, and has the Sight of the Eye, and the Use of the Muscles. But some time after he seemed well, he told me, that, upon leaning down forward, he felt great Pains in his Head. The Piece is supposed to have passed behind the right Eye. I am, Lincolns-Inn, Nov. 10. 1748. S I R, Your humble Servant, Richard Hassel. VII.
