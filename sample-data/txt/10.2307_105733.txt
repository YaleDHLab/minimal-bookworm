An Account of the Insect called the Vegetable Fly: by William Watson, M. D. F. R. S. To the Royal Society. Gentlemen, T H E beginning of last month, I received a letter from our learned and ingenious member Dr. Huxham of Plymouth; in which among other things he informed me, that he lately had, by permission of commissioner Rogers, obtained a sight of what is called the vegetable fly, with the following description of it; both which he had from Mr. Newman, an officer of general Duroure's regiment, who came from the island Dominica. As this description seemed to the doctor exceedingly curious, he has sent it me, exactly transcribed from Mr. Newman's account, and is as follows. Read Nov. 24, 1763. `` The vegetable fly is found in the island Dominica, `` and (excepting that it has no wings) resembles the `` drone both in size and colour more than any other `` English insect. In the month of May it buries itself `` in [272] `` in the earth, and begins to vegetate. By the latter `` end of July the tree is arrived at it's full growth, `` and resembles a coral branch; and is about three `` inches high, and bears several little pods, which `` dropping off become worms, and from thence `` flies, like the English caterpillar.'' An account of this extraordinary production, similar to the above, was given to Dr. Huxham by captain Gascoign, who lately commanded the Dublin man of war, which hath been at Dominica. The doctor subjoins, that possibly I may have heard of this fly; or seen it in the collections of the British Museum, or Royal Society; but, if it is in neither, he believes he can procure it to be sent to the Royal Society. Though the doctor can by no means think the above relation true in all it's circumstances, yet he is persuaded there is something of reality in it; which perhaps further accounts and observations may set in a full and true light: though at present, as represented, it seems quite repugnant to the usual order of nature. As I had never seen this production myself, but had been informed that doctor Hill had had the examination of some of them, I wrote to that gentleman to desire to be informed of the result of his enquiries. To which he very obligingly sent me the following answer. `` When colonel Melvil brought these flies from `` Guadalupe, lord Bute sent me the box of them to `` examine. The result was this. There is in Mar`` tinique a fungus of the Clavaria kind, different `` in species from those hitherto known. It produces `` soboles from its sides. I called it therefore Cla`` varia [273] `` varia Sobolifera. It grows on putrid animal bodies, `` as our fungus ex pede equino from the dead horses `` hoof. `` The Cicada is common in Martinique, and in `` it's nympha state, in which the old authors call it `` Tettigometra, it buries itself under dead leaves to `` wait it's change; and when the season is unfavour`` able, many perish. The seeds of the Clavaria find a `` proper bed on this dead insect, and grow. `` The Tettigometra is among the Cicadae in the `` British Museum: the Clavaria is just now known. `` This you may be assured is the fact, and all the `` fact; though the untaught inhabitants suppose a `` fly to vegetate; and though there exists a Spanish `` drawing of the plant's growing into a tri-foliate tree; `` and it has been figured with the creature flying `` with this tree upon its back. `` So wild are the imaginations of Man; so chaste `` and uniform is Nature!'' Commissioner Rogers, at Dr. Huxham's desire, has presented this extraordinary production to the Royal Society, and it now lies before you. A careful examination of it seems to confirm, to me at least, Dr. Hill's opinion of the manner of this phaenomenon's being produced. The ingenious Mr. * Edwards has taken notice of this extraordinary production, in his Gleanings of Natural History, and has given us a figure of it in that elegant work. There is in the British Museum among the Cicadae one, nearly resembling the animal part of the * Vol. III. page 262, plate 335. V O L. LIII. O o pro[274] production before you; but it came from the East Indies. There is likewise from the West Indies, in its perfect or winged state, the insect, of which this production is believed to be the nympha. [Vid. TAB.
