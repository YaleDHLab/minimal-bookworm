Part of a Letter from Mr Ralph Thoresby, F. R. S. giving a farther Account of an Eruption of Waters in Craven. IN Philos. Transact. Number 245, is register'd the Vicar of Kildnick's Letter, which gives an account of an extraordinary Eruption of Water in Craven. I was lately enquiring further concerning it, of one that is now my Tenant and Neighbour; and am not only fully satisfied of the Truth of what the said Mr Pollard affirms, but also that, as he conjectures, a great part of the Land is not to this day recover'd from the Sand and Stones, though a great number of People were employed about it. Upon the opening of the Rock, at the foot of which the Town of Starbotham stands, the Water gushed out in so vast a quantity, as if it would have swept away the whole Town: (2237) Town: The Waves came rolling down, like long Swarths of Grass, one upon another, to use the Metaphor of the Relater, who had never seen the Sea. Several Houses were utterly ruin'd, and others wreckt up to the Chamber Windows; one particularly so covered, that a great piece of the Rock was left upon the top of the Chimney. These things my Neighbour was an Eye-Witness of, and had many a weary day in clearing some part of his Land. His House was, for some time, full of Neighbours, who were harbourless by this sudden Accident. Leeds, August 20, 1705.
