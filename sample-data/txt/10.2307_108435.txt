227 ] XI. Researches on the Tides.-Fourteenth Series. On the Results of continued Tide Observations at several places on the British Coasts. By the Rev. W. WHEWELL, D.D., F.R.S. Received October 24, 1849,--Read January 31, 1850. TIDE observations made at several different parts of the British and the neighbouring shores, and in some instances continued for a considerable period, have been discussed by Mr. D. Ross of the Hydrographer's Office, with great labour and perseverance; and as the results which his labours afford may be of use to mariners, I offer to the Royal Society a brief statement of these results. The discussions at present referred to relate to the height of high water, and the variations which this height undergoes in proceeding from springs to neaps and from neaps to springs. It is found, by examining the observations at 120 places and throwing the heights into curves, that the curve is very nearly of the same form at all these places. Hence the semimensual series of heights at any place affords a rule for the series of heights at all other places where the difference of spring height and neap height is the same. For instance, Portsmouth, where the difference of spring height and neap height is 2 feet 8 inches, is a rule for Cork, Waterford, Inverness, Bantry, Boucout on the A French coast, and other places. I And the Tables of the height of high water at one of these places suffice for all the others, a constant being of course added or subtracted according to the position of the zero-point from which the 9 heights at each place are measured. The series of heights of high water for a semilunation also agrees very exactly, as to the form of the curve, with the equilibrium theory. The following construction gives this curve. With centre C and radius CA (half the difference of the height at spring and neaps), describe a circle; and in AC produced take CD to CA as 12 to 5. Divide the circumference of the circle into twelve hours, representing the twelve hours of moon's transit; and join D with each of these divisions. The lines thus drawn to the hours will give the heights of high water for each hour of thle mIoon's 2oG2 2'28 THE REV. W. WHEWELL ON THE RESULTS OF CONTINUED TIDE transit; a constant quantity being, as before stated, added or subtracted in order to refer the height to the proper zero. According to the theory, the Oh or 12"1 hour-points would be at A; the ratio of DC to AC would be that of the lunar to the solar tide; and the distances of the hourpoints from D would be the heights of high water above mean water. But all these properties are, in the actual cases, modified in a manner which must be noticed. The tides in these discussions are not referred to the transit of the moon immediately preceding, but to some earlier transit, namnely, the second, third, fourth or fifth preceding transit; it being found that in this way the accordance with the theory becomes more exact. Thus in the British Channel the tides are referred to the third preceding transit; and this extends also to Ireland and to the west coast of England and Scotland. On the east coast of England, in the northern parts, as at Shields, Sunderland, Scarborough and Hull, the fourth preceding transit is used; at Harwich, Sheerness and London, thelfth (see Table B). But this reference to an earlier transit does not make the highest tide correspond exactly with the hour of transit 0h or 121: and it is found, in the cases which have been included in the present examination, that a displacement of the oh point about fifteen minutes from A will best make the theoretical and the observed curves agree with each other. The ratio of DC to AC is, as has been said, 12 to 5; and this, according to the theory, would be the ratio of the lunar to the solar tide. If this were the case, the spring tide measured above mean water would be 17, and the total spring tide above spring tide low water would be 34. The neap tide in this case would be 7 above mean water, and therefore 24 above spring tide low water. Hence the difference of springs and neaps would be to the height of neaps above low water springs as 10 to 24, a ratio constant for all places. But in fact, this ratio of the excess of springs to the total height of neaps above low water springs is different at different places: and the observations now undler consideration show in some measure the law of this difference. The ratio is smaller when the tide is smaller. This appears from the observations at different places, as arranged b)y Mr. Ross in the annexed Table A. We have there the following results, taking the means of groups of places according to the amount of tide.

But it appears that in general the mean water is lower than this: and the excess of springs being 10, the mean water is front 14 to 19 below neap high water at various points on the coast of Great Britain and France. In consequence of the law of the high waters, given alike by the theory and by the observations, the spring high waters are above the mean high water for a longer period than the neaps are below it. For it -is evident that if DE and DF be each equal to DC, the heights are greater than the mean DC through the arc EAF, which is greater than a semicircle. And it is evident that the excess of AE above a quadrant will be an arc of which the sine is g orC ? ; or 12? nearly. Hence the two DC 2 4' ec h w portions of the semicircle will be, in time, 3h 24'n and 2h 38in; and the tides will be above the mean during 6h 48m of lunar transit, and below the mean during 511 12m; and this is found to be very nearly the case at all the places examined; thus confirming the identity of the rule of different places one with another, and with the construction given above. 230 THE REV. W. WHEWEILI ON THE RESULTS OF CONTINUED TIDE Additional Note on the Tides of the Bristol Channel. Mr. Ross has traced the modification which the semimensual inequality of heights undergoes in ascending the Bristol Channel from Pembroke to Bristol. This modi.fication is shown in the accompanying figure. It appears from the diagram which 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 Feet. __ __ [11 ___ . 410 ____ n _____ ___ 6 . _ _ _,_._ .__ Mr. Ross has drawn from the observations, that the difference of springs and neaps increases gradually from Pembroke to Llanelly, Weston, Cardiff, and finally Bristol, the difference being 5 ft. 6 in. at the first place, and 10 ft. 6 in. at the last; and the curve which represents the change from day to day being at all the places of the same form, namely, of the form described in the preceding paper.
