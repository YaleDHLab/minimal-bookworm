[236] XXXII. Observations made at Leicester on the Transit of Venus over the Sun, June 3, 1769. By the Reverend Mr. Ludlam, Vicar of Norton, near Leicester. T H E telescope, used for viewing the planet, was made by Mr. Dollond, with a triple object glass of 33 1/3 inches focal distance, and was found by experiment to magnify 54 times. The clock was firmly fixed; its pendulum rod was made of wood. The transit telescope was not accurately adjusted either to the meridian or horizon, but the transits of the Sun and of ~ Bootis registered below are sufficient to show the rate of the going of the clock, and the corresponding altitudes of the Sun, its error a few days before the transit of the planet; whence the necessary reduction of the time then shewn by the clock to apparent time may be easily derived.

At VIIh 6~ ~, according to the time shewn by the clock, a small indenture appeared on the Sun's limb; the increase of it at VIIh 6~ 14~, shewed plainly that it was made by the expected planet. The [239] The internal contact was first noted at VIIh 23~ 56~; at VIIh 24~ 8~, the divided part of the Sun's limb seemed wholly united. The edge both of the Sun and Planet were in a continual tremor; at the internal contact the limb of the Sun seemed, for several seconds, to be alternately united and again separated by a kind of shootings of the Planet. These observations, reduced to apparent time, give the external contact at VIIh 7~ 1~, the internal contact at VIIh 25~ 9~, the duration 18~ 8~. The solar eclipse was observed by the same clock and telescope. It was manifestly begun at XVIIIh 34~ 26~, according to the time shewn by the clock. The ending was exactly noted at XXh 20~ 8~. The Sun's limb appeared very well defined all the morning. These observations, reduced to solar time, make the beginning of the eclipse at XVIIIh 35~ 21~, the end at XXh 21~ 2~, the duration Ih 45~ 41~.
