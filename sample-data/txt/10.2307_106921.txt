'33 VI. On the periodical changes of Brightness of twofixed Stars. By Edward Pigott, Esq. Communicated by Sir Henry C. Englefield, Bart. F. R. S. Read January 12, 1797. Bath, August, 1 796. ALTHOUGH those far distant suns, the fixed stars, have baffled all investigation with. regard to our knowledge of their distance, magnitudes, and attractions; we have, nevertheless, by determining, their periodical changes of light, established a strong affinity between them and our sun; and among such an inconceivable. number, we may expect to find some with periods of rotation much longer and shorter than those-we are already acquainted with, and with changes perhaps even sufficiently rapid to afford a ready, means for determining, accurately differences of terrestrial longitudes. This would be a most satisfactory, useful, and profitable discovery and may be the lot of those who. have but a slight knowledge of astronomy, provided that with great exactness, and a good memory,, a constant look out be given. The discoveries which, at present I have the honour of laying before the Society, are the periodical changes of brightness of two stars, one in Sobieski's Shield, the other in the Northern Cr eown. The constellation of Sobieski's Shield consists of a very few stars, and was formed by HEVELIUS, in hon-our of a king of Poland; the variable star that now appears, in it was, doubtless, not noticed by him, as he has set down stars near it, which are by times much less conspicuous. It has nearly the same right ascension as the star 1, and is about one degree more Mr. PIGOTT on the periodical Changes of south: this, for the present, suffices to point out its place; for as I wvish to proceed immediately tothe results, I -:shall, for greater perspicuity, collect at the end of this accnt,;a more exact determination of its right ascension and declination, as also a plan of the stars situated near it. When at its full and: least brightness it attains in different periods, different degrees of brightness: I have never yet seen it of as greater magnitude than of the 5th, nor whenat its least, less than the 7.8th. It completes all its changes in about 63 days, being ipe at its full brightness without any perceptible change 9--' at its least, also without any perceptible change; 28 &t dast decreasing from the middle of its full brightness to the middle of its least;e and A increasing Afrom the middle of i ts least brightness to the middle of its full. These results being deduced from only the few observations I have^; made, cannot, of course, be very accurate, but may easily and: soon be corrected by comparing any future observations with those communicated in this paper; not relying much ont the estimated magnitudes, but principally on its comparative brightness with the stars there mentioned and marked in the plan,, the magnitudes of which, by a mean of several observations, I have settled thus :Magnitudes. 3 i 4 n 4 1 45. k S S The nine first letters are according to FLAMSTED, the others as Us 5.6 1 affixed by me, .6 1. g 5.6 * above 1 6 P 6.7 neb. 6.7 r 7 T J the Brightness of twofixed Stars.

August, its changes seem different from those of the four preceding periods; and how these perturbations will terminate, the Brightness of two fixed Stars. 3 7 cannot be settled in the present account, as I mean here to conclude it; but will add in the Journal, observations of as late a date as possible. The mean right ascensions of the stars here given, were deduced from observations made in the meridian with a small transit instrument, and are, I believe, accurate. The declinations are not settled with greater precision than to two or three minutes; and although quite sufficient to prevent any mistake, Ihave, for the satisfaction of those who wish to make further observations on them, drawn up the annexed plan, in which all the stars they were compared to, can easilybe found; no greater exactness is intended.

Its right ascension and declination have just been given, as likewise the plan of the stars near it. This star, although not in FLAMSTEAD'S catalogue, is marked on BAYER'S maps of the 6th magnitude. Several years ago, in 1783, 1784, and f785, I suspected it to be changeable, which induced me to make the memorandums here copied in the Journal, since which time I have often seen it, but not perceiving any alteration, the dates were neglected until the spring of 1795; I then had the satisfaction of finding my suspicions confirmed, it being invisible; but on the 2oth of June, it appeared of the 9.1oth magnitude, and went through MDCCXCVII. T 138 Mr. PIGOTT on the periodicale Changes of its various changes yas follows : in six weeks it had increased to its full brightness, the middle time of which was August iith, 1795. At its full brightness it was of the 6.7th magnitude, annd remained the same without any perceptible alteration for about three weeks: it then was three weeks and a half in decreasing to the 9.loth mag Initude, and disappeared a few days after. Having reappeared in the following April, 1796, it was on the 7th of May again of the 9.ioth magnitude, and increasing nearly in a similar manner as on the 2oth of June the preceding year; which completes all its changes, and gives a period of ten months and a half. Very remarkable and perplexing it was, that just after I had made out the periods of these two variable stars, their changes should appear different from those before observed; the particulars concerning that in Sobieski's Shield have been noticed: as for this in the Northern Crown, it shews at present (being the computed time of its full brightness), great unsteadiness, more so, I think, than any of the variables whose periods have been settled with certainty; for having increased as before, with tolerable regularity, till it attained the 7.8th magnitude, it then kept wavering between those magnitudes, and is still so at the present time (August) that I am closing my account of it. I nevertheless hope to add a Dfew more remarks in the Journal, as I have done for the other variable. Future observations will determine how far the period of ten months and a half is rightly settled. I am greatly inclined to think it the true one, as the star went through all its changes progressively and steadily. Many of the variables are occasionally liable to unexpected changes, particularly at the attainment of their full brightness in different periods; such perturbed period may the Brightness of two ftxed Stars. 1-9 perhaps be found to return after a certain number of more regular ones; but to ascertain this, requires probably a long series of obsevations.The magnitude of the: stars in te Northern Crown, marked on my tplan, and to: some of which the variable was compared. are here accurately fixed by a mean of many observations (See Tab.
