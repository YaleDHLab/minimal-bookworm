Abstract of a Register of the Barometer Thermometer, and Rain, at Lyndon, in Rutland, s793. By Thomas Barker, Esq. Communicated by Sir Joseph Banks, Bart. P.R. $. Read March 27, 1y94.July 5 to x8 Mr. BARKER)S Register, &c.175The winter was in general an open one; about a week's frost at the beginning of the year, the rains less than tl ey had been, yet at times enough to keep it very clirty. The latter end of January, and tlle month of February were mild and fine, and the birds singing, but it was windy at tilmes, and more so ila IQ4arcll, which svas a very uncertain month being alternately windy, finey wern and at the etld frosty; and thet first of April there calne a great snow, the only considerable orle this willter, and was followed by floods ful: several days (Ot,ether, and a very backening season. This great SI1OW and wet conzing after sI good deal of the spring corn was sowns was a damage to the crops S and the three following months being very dryS and just in the long daysn tlle ground cracked andl burnt very much, and 3nany of the spring crops *vere very smalln botla for hay, strav, and corn; the wheat crop was the best, and that was pretty good. The forrner part of the surnmer was cool, and sometimes cold, frequent frosty mornings, even into June S but July was hot and burning, and the fortniglat from July to 18 was uncommotlly so; nine days out of twelve the thermometer was up to or above 803 and one day it was 89; this I think I never knew before, either for height or continuance, unless it was so in that hottest of summers 17S° This hot dry time hindered the sowing or coming up of turnips, which were late alld dear this year. The hay, except on some moist meadows, was very light, but well gotten, as was also all the grain, but very clear, especially the sprilag corn. This sumnzer was complained of as dry, but it was so only the three naonths May, June, and July S there was only the quantity of one month's rain in those three months, andsthat 176AIr . BA R K E R s Registe s-, A c .being just iz the long daysn in the high StZOlig SUN, and when a11 the crops should be in their greatest gronvth, they <were much hurt by it, and perhaps the more so for having beerF before oversoaked with snow and wet. The latter part of ad-e summer was very fine, rain enotlgh to rnake tthe grass grow, atld fine enougll to get the crops in rvellX great eddislles, and more grass than there had been in any part of the summer before. And when in September and NoveJnber there came ts -o wet months, the cracks and dryness of the ground underneath carried it all clear off. The autumn also was remarliably fine, calm, mild, arod almost without frost, so that the grass contirlued green till Christmas, which was very useful to the farmers, as it saved their fodder very much, which was very scarce.
