(74) VIII. An Account of an extraordinary Effect of Lightning in communicating Magnetism. Communicated by Pierce Dod, M. D. F. R. S. from Dr. Cookson of Wakefield in Yorkshire. A Tradesman in this Place having put up a great Number of Knives and Forks in a large Box, some in Cases or Sheaths, and others not, of different Sizes, and of different Persons making, in order to be sent beyond Sea; and having placed the Box in the Corner of a large Room, there happen'd a sudden Storm of Thunder, Lightning, &c. by which the Corner of the Room was damaged, the Box split, and a good many Knives and Forks melted, the Sheaths being untouch'd. The Owner emptying the Box upon a Counter where some Nails lay, the Persons who took up the Knives, that lay upon the Nails, observed that the Knives took up the Nails, Upon this the whole Numbers was try'd, and sound to do the same, nay, to such a degree as to take up large Nails, Packing-Needles, and other Iron Things of considerable Weight. Needles or other Things placed upon a Pewter-Dish, would follow the Knife or Fork, though held under the Dish, and would move along as the Knife or Fork was moved; with several other odd Appearances, which I won't now trouble you with, only this, that though you heat the Knives red-hot, yet their Power is still the same when cold. 2 You (75) You may be assur'd of the Truth of this, having myself made a good many Trials of the Knives and the Forks: How they came by this magnetick Power, or how Lightning should be capable of communicating such a Power, is the Quaere.
