183 IX. Al new Method of computing the Value of a slowly con. verging Series, of which all the Terms are affirmative. Bv the Rev. John Hellins, F. R. S. and Vicar of Potter's-Pury, in Northamptonshire. In a Letter to the Rev. Dr. Maskelyne, F. R. S. and Astronomer Royal. Read March 8, 1798. REV. SIR., Potter's-Piiry, February 8, x798. THAT several of the most curious and difficult problems 'in physical astronomy have hitherto been solved only by means of slowly converging series, is a truth which you are, well ac_ quainted with, and which may be seen in the works of the late learned EULER, and others, on that subject. Of this kind of series is the following, viz,ax + bx'+ cx' + d x4 &c. ad infinitum, when all the terms are affirmative, and a, b, c, &c. differ but little from each other, and x is but little less than i; to obtain the value of which, to seven places of figures, by computing the terms as they stand, and adding them together, is a very laborious and tiresome operation; and therefore some easier method of obtaining it is very desirable. About five years ago, the consideration of this matter was recommended to me by Mr. Baron MASERES, (who not only employs his own leisure in explaining and improving the higher parts of the mathematics, but also encourages others who make the same laudable use of their leisure,) to whom I then communicated the method of computation explained in the paper inclosed in 184 Mr. HELLINS'S new Method of computing this letter. As this method is general, for all slowly converging series of the form abovementioned, (which is generally allowed to be the most difficult,) I am induced to present it to you, requesting that, if it meets with your approbation, you will communicate it to the Royal Society. I am, Rev. Sir, &c. JOHN HELLINS. P. S. I need not observe to you, that it is not requisite to the summation of the series mentioned in this letter, that b should be less than a, c less than b, d less than c, &c. but only that the first, second, third, &c. differences of these coefficients should be a series of decreasing quantities: for, you well know, there are series of that form, which arise in physical astronomy, of which the coefficients are actually a diverging series, and yet the sum of the whole is a finite quantity. And the same thing is evident, from the bare inspection of the theorem which; I shall presently use. i. The computing of the value of the series ax + bx'+ cx' + dx + &c. ad infinitum, in which all the terms are affirmative, and the differences of the coefficients a, b, c, &c. are but small, though decreasing, quantities, and x is but little less than i, is (as has been before observed) a laborious operation, and has engaged the attention of some eminent mathematicians, both at home and abroad, whose ingenious devices on the occasion entitle them to esteem. Of the several methods of the Value of a slowly converging Series. 185 obtaining the value of this series, which have occurred to me, the easiest is that which I am now to describe, by which the business is reduced to the summation of two, three, or more series of this form, viz. ax -b x+ c3dx, &c. and one series of this form, viz. px" + qx'n+ rx+ Ti &c. where n is 4, 8, i6, 32, or some higher power of 2. The investigation of this method is as follows. 2. The series ax + b x+ caxd + dx4 + ex'+fx6+ c. Is evidently equal to the sum of these two series, viz. ax bx1+ cxi.dx + exs-f], &c. * + 2bXs * + 2dX' * + 2fXI, &C. of which, the value of the former is easily attainable, by the method so clearly explained, and fully illustrated, by Mr. Baron MASERES, in the Philosophical Transactions for the year i 777; and the latter, although it be of the same form with the series first proposed, yet has a great advantage over it, since it converges twice as fast. Upon this principle, then, we may pro. ceed to resolve the series 2bx1+ 2dx4+ 2fx6+ 2bx'+ 2kx' + 2mx'1-r &c. into the two following: 2bx2dx4 r+ 2fx6.-shx'+ 9kx`. 2mx', &c. * + 4dx4 * + 4hx' * + mxI% &C. where, again, the value of the one may easily be computed: and the other, although it be of the same form with the series at first proposed, yet converges four times as fast. And, in this manner we may go on, till we obtain a series of the same form with the series at first proposed, which shall converge 8, 16, 32, 64, &c. times as fast and consequently a few terms of it will be all that are requisite. An example, to illustrate this method, may be proper, which therefore is here subjoined. UDCCXCVIII. Bb i86 Mr. HELLINs'S new Method of computing 3. Let it be proposed to find the value of the series x + 7 x3 x6+&. di 9 + t+ 4 + P 6+ iflinitum, when x 4. In order to obtain the sum of this series, with the less work, it wvill be requisite to compute a few of the initial terms, as they stand.. For, if we begin the. operation with computing the value of x _ IZ + -3_ , &c. .by the differential series be-, 2 3 4 fore mentioned *, the values of D', D", D"', &c. will be -i, 3 .23 &c. respectively, i. e.

It may be further remarked, for the sake of my less expe-. rienced readers, (for whose information this article is chiefly intended,) that the second term of the last series is produced by multiplying the first by * X the third, by multiplying z6xz + x' the second by -2*-.L; the fourth, by multiplying the third by 27 I-j3 X z38 1 ,.;and so on. If, therefore, the first term be called P. the second Q. the third R, the fourth S., &c. we shall have, Bb2 188 Mr. HELLINS'S new Metbod of computing 25 1+X' P 61 +X, 2Q X R.27 1 +X), S.3R X 28 1+.X; which form is well adapted to arithmetical calculation. And, that a similar form for -that purpose may always be obtained, when the coefficients of the proposed series are the reciprocals of any arithmetical progression, has been shewn by Mr. SIMPsoN, in his Mathematical Dissertations, p. 64. Having premised these observations, I now proceed to the arithmetical work; in which I shall use, and explain, such other devices as have occurred to me for facilitating it. A. Since the work of computing the value of the proposed series is so much shortened, by first finding the sum of a moderate number of initial terms, and then resolving the remaining terms into several series, in the manner described in Art. 2, I will begin with computing the first twenty-four terms of it; and, to facilitate this part of the work, I will separate these terms into three parts; viz. x + + + + + + + X9 x"1 wxs ZTo *X3 + 4 was .G + Ale _ _ +I X +__ ; I _ + 9 10 I I 12 +3 14? 15 i6 ,,17 is8 r19 %O -wt s x23 X + x24 17I 8 '9 20 21 22 23 24a which are evidently equal to *+ X + X3 + 64 + VI+ .6.+ X + Xa |~~ 3 X 5 6 +7 2+, , 5+, XrJ -~r I07+ + +9 t 20 21 +--+ + 10 12 + ~~13 +14 1 17 ( $ x 9 20 21Z 2 23 ?24) the Value of a slowly converging Series. 189 which three parts, for the sake of reference, may be called A, Bx', and Cx'6. It is evident also, that the numerical values of the first eight powers of x are all that are required for finding the sum of these twenty-four terms of the series proposed: for Bx8+ Cx"6 is x8 (B + Cx8); and this product + A = the sum required*. The numerical values of the first eight powers of x are these: X = 09, xt= o 81, 3x 0 729., x4_ o656i, XS= 0'59049,. X6= 05314,41, 7_ X = 04782969, xs= 043046721; from which values of the powers of x, the values. of A,. B., and C, continued to twelve places of decimals, are easily obtained, and are as follow. The same thing might have been obtained from the first four powers of x, or front the first six powers of x; as might likewise the sum of 32, 36, 40, or any other number of terms that is a multiple of 4. or 6. But the number 8 is here chosen, for the sake of a subsequent use that will be made of the value of x$. 190 Mr. HELL INS'S new Method of computing X = 0.9 x2 7o0405 x3 0243 o = 16402,5 o 118o9,8 5 6 = o0o8857,35 7 = oo6832,81285,71 Xs S= 0-05380,84012,50 The sum is 2-04083,So2g98,21 A. x=0'1 9 =0o081 10 X3 o o6627,27272,73 X4 1 2 =0?05467,50000,00 X'_ 004542,23076,92 1-3 4 =0-03796,00714,29 -X 0o03188,64600,oo Xs 6 = 0 02690,42006,25 The sum is 044412,07670,19 B. the Value of a slowly converging Series. 191 -?05294, 11764,7.1 x 20 0'03280,50000,00 21 = 0o0281 1,8t5714,29 2 000241 5,6490-,92[ 17 23--0 2079,551738,91 x 3 = 0793,61337,50 The sum is 0'26012,12291,85 = C. -We may now quickly find the sum of the first twenty-four terms of the series proposed, by two multiplications by *8, and two additions, as was pointed out inl the former part of this article; but, since the labour of these two separate multiplications may be saved, I shall now proceed to compute the van 2 1 lue of the remaining terms of the proposed series.

The values of the several parts,. into which the proposed series has been resolved, being now so far obtained that we have only to multiply each by its proper factor, viz. the numerical value of x8, x6, x3, &c. and add the products together, to get the sum of it; this, therefore, is now to be performed. And, in this part of the calculation, several multiplications may be saved, and no larger factor than x8 be used, by attending to the method described by Sir ISAAC NEWTON, in his Tract De Analysi per .Equationes infinitas; p. 1o. of Mr. JONES'S edition of Sir ISAAC's Tracts; or p. 270. Vol. I. of Bishop HORSLEY'S edition of all his works. The manner in which this is to be done will appear, by collecting the several parts from the preceding Articles, and exhibiting them in one view, thus: A+ Bx8+ Cx6+ a + Dx x'+ C + E xx"+7xy0+ S+ Fx x= the sum of the proposed series. Now, ist. Calling A + F, z', and multiplying by x8, we have z' x' _ o026584,70242 x 0-43046,7291 = 0-1 1443,84267,92dly.

Putting B + zv x8 = zvi, and multiplying by x8, we get rVi x8 = o'6o8o6,5o444;24 x 043046,721-= 026175,2o631,73. Lastly, to this product add A = 2'04083,30298,21, andwe have thevalue of theseries proposed 2%3o258,50929,94, which is true to twelve places of figures. the Value of a slowly converging Series. 199 14. It may not be improper to remark, that this degree of accuracy is much greater than is requisite, even in astronomy; for which, as well as -for most other purposes, six or seven places of figures are sufficientt: and, to that degree of exactness the value of the proposedseries might have been -obtained, by less than a fourth part of the labour that has been taken above. But it was my intention to show, that the value of a very slowly converging series, of which all the terms are affirmative, may, by the method now described, be computed to ten or twelve places of figures, in the space of a few hours.
