An Observation of an uncommon Gleam of Light proceeding from the Sun, by Mr. Peter Collinson F. R. S. ON the 8th of March 1746-7, near 8 o'Clock in the Morning, as I was riding within three Miles of Brentwood in Essex, there appeared a Singular Phaenomenon in the Heavens; the Sketch (TAB.. Fig..) may give some Idea of it. Read March 19. 1746-7. The Morning was fine and clear, the Sun shone bright, no Cloud to be seen, but the Air a little hazy: Where the Phaenomenon appeared, which was a bright cloudy Spot, seem'd a very small Portion of a Rainbow, [457] a Rainbow, only the Colours very faint. It was in a horizontal Direction North of the Sun, and from it projected a long luminous Ray, which terminated in a Point. It continu'd very strong for more than half an Hour after I saw it, and then vanish'd away by degrees. P. Collinson. VII.
