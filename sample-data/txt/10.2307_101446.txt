Of the nature of a certain Stone, found in the Indies, in the head of a Serpent. There was, some while ago, sent by Sir Phileberto Vernatti from Java major, where he resides, to Sir Robert Moray, for the Repository of the Royal Society, a certain Stone, affirmed by the Presenter to be found in the Head of a Snake, which laid upon any Wound, made by any venomous Greature, is said to stick to it, and so draws away all Poyson: and then, being put in Milk, to void its Poyson therein, and to make the Milk turn blew; in which manner it must be used, till the Wound be cleansed. The like Relations having been made, by several others, of such a Stone, and some also in this City affirming, to have made the Experiment with success, it was thought worth while, to inquire further into the truth of this Matter: since which time, nothing hath been met with but an Information, delivered by that Ingenious Parisian, Monsieur Thevenot, in his second Tome, of the Relations of divers considirable Voyages, whereof he lately presented some Exemplars to his Friends in England. The Book being in French, and not common, 'tis conceived it will not be amiss to insert here the said Information, which is to this effect: In the East Indies, and in the Kingdom of Quamsy in China, there is found a Stone in the Head of certain Serpents (which they call by a name signifying Hairy Serpents) which heals the bitings of the same Serpent, that else would kill in 24 hours. This Stone is round, white in the middle, and about the edges (103) edges blew or greenish. Being applyed to the Wound, it adheres to it of it self, and falls not off, but after it hath sucked the Poyson: Then they wash it in Milk, wherein itis left awhile, till it return to its natural condition. It is a rare Stone, for if it be put the second time upon the Wound, and stick to it, 'tis a sign it had not suck'd all the Venome during its first application; but if it stick not, 'tis a mark that all the Poyson was drawn out at first. So far our French Author: wherein appears no considerable difference frons the written Relation before mentioned.
