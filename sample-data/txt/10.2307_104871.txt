Presented July 4. 1747. Then. will the terms in any column of the following table, be proportional to their corresponding ones in any other column. From A TABLE of the Relations of Goniometrical ~. s, 2 z ~, 2 z s, a s, A 2 s, z s, A+s, a s, A + a u A + a u A-u a s, a-s, A s, 2 x u 2 x 2 s, x s, A-s, a u A-u a s, A a u A a u 2 z s, 2 z 2 s, z s, A + s, a s, A-s, a u A + a s, A + a u, 2 x s, 2 x 2 s, x s, A + s, a u A a s, A a r s, z s, z s, x s, x s, z r t, z ~, z s, z s, z-s, z s, z ~, z r l, z+ l, z s, z s, v s, x r l, x l, x s, x s, x-s, x From hence, almost an infinite number of theorems may easily be derived; some of which are the following, given here as examples of the use of the table. I. s,z~s,x = 1/2r~s,a-s,A = 1/2r~s,z-x-s,z+x = s,z/s,x rr = s,x/s,z rr. s,z~s,x = 1/2r~s,a+s,A = 1/2r~s,z-x+s,z+x = s,z/s,x rr = s,x/s,z rr. II. If A, B, C, be any three angles; Z = A+B,X = A-B,H = 1/2A+B+C. Then 1/2r~v, C-v,X = s,1/2C+X~s,1/2C-X=s,1/2A+C-B~s, 1/2B+C-A = s,H-B~s,H-A. And 1/2r~v,Z-v, C = s, 1/2Z+C~s,1/2Z-C = s,1/2A+B+C~s,1/2A+B-C = s,H~s,H-C. III. ss,z/s s,z = tt,z/rr = rr/t t,z = v,2z/v,2z = t,z/t,z; Or ss,1/2z/s s,1/2z = tt,1/2z/rr = rr/t t,1/2z = v,z/v,z = t,1/2z/t,1/2z. IV. [562] IV. 1/2r = ss,z/v,2z = ss,1/2z/v,z = s s,z/v,2z = s s,1/2z/v,z; and s,z = 2ss,1/2z/t,1/2z = 2s s,1/2z/t,1/2z. V. s,z/v,z = r/t,1/2z = t,1/2z/r = v,z/s,z. VI. t,z/t,x = s,A+s,a/s,A-s,a = t,x/t,z; and rr/t,z~t,x = t,z/t,x = t,x/t,z = s,a+s,A/s,a-s,A = t,z~t,x/rr. VII. s, A/s,a = t,z+t,x/t,z-t,x = s,z+x/s,z-x; if z and x are two arcs, then A=z + x,a = z-x. VIII. s,z~x = s,z~s,x+s,z~s,x/r = t,z~t,x/s,z~s,x. IX. s,z~x = s,z~s,x+s,z~s,x/r = rr~t,z~t,x/s,z~s,xr. X. t,z~x = t,z~t,x/rr~t,z~t,xrr; and t,z~x = rr~t,z~t,x/t,z~t,x. XI. s,z~x = s,z~s,x/rr~t,z~t,xr; and s,z~z = s,z~s,x/t,z~t,x. XII. In three equidifferent arcs A, z, a; where z (=1/2A~a) is the mean arc, and (=1/2A~a) their common difference; put p = s,x/r, q = s,x/r; P = 2p~s,z,Q = 2q~s,z. Then s, A = P-s,a = Q+s,a; And s,a = P-s, A = s,A-Q. XIII. Let d = v,A-v,a = s,a-s,A; then ss, A-ss,a = 2s,A+d~d = 2s,a-d~d. Note, When an arc is terminated in the second, third, or fourth quadrant, some of the signs (+ and -) of the terms in the preceding theorems, will, by the known rules, become contrary to what they now are. XIV. [563] XIV. Let,A,B,C, &c. be the sines, a,b,c, &c. the co-sines, a, b, c, &c. the tangents, of the arcs, ~, ~, ~, &c. whose number is n; the radius being r; put S for the product of the n co-sines, S, S, S, &c. for the sum of the products made of every sine, every two, three, &c. sines, by the other (n-1, n-2, n-3, &c.) co-sines, where the co-sine noted by n-n is unity. Then the sine of ~+~+~+~, &c. = S-S+S-S, &c. ~1/rn-1. And the co-sine of ~+~+~+~, &c. = S-S+S-S, &c. ~1/rn-1. XV. Also putting T for the sum of the tangents of the arcs, ~, ~, ~, &c. T~, T~, T~, &c. for the sum of the products of every two, three, four, &c. tangents; and A = T B = AT~ T~ C = BT~ AT~ + T~ D = CT~ BT~ + AT~ T~ E = DT~ CT~ + BT~ AT~ + T~. Put R = 1/rr Then the tangent of ~+~+~+~, &c. = A+BR+CR2+DR3+ER4; &c. XVI. Hence, the sine, tangent, and secant, of any arc a, being represented by s, t, s, the co-sine, co-tangent, and co-secant, by s, t, s; those of the arc na are expressed as in the following theorems.
