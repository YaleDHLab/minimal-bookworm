VIL. A Catalogue of North Polar Distances of some of the prinz c.pal fixed Stars. By John Pond, Esq. Astronomer Royal F.R.S. Read December 17, 1812. H HE catalogue which I have the honour --of transmitting to the Society, is the result of a great number of observations made with the new Mural Circle, fromn the month of June last to the present time. I hope at no very distant period to add considerably to its precision; but I trust that in its present state, it will not be thought unacceptableto astronomers, as from the experience I have now obtained of the instrument, I may safely pronounce that it far exceeds in accuracy any thing yet known in the history of practical astronomy. In the fourth column I have annexed the degree of uncertainty, or maximum of error, to which I conceive the results are liable. These numbers not being derived from any strict mathematical process, must only be considered as indicating the opinion I have formed on the subject. When the observations themselves are laid before the Society, I shall have an opportunity of stating at length on what grounds this opinion was formed. 76 Mr. POND'S Catalogue of North Polar Distances, &c. j 13 Maxcimum of 0 Effrtowhc P.Distances begin.* o which Names of Stars. |Nb 0 p 1 this Catalogue Z tbem roaiiblby I Polaris (Summer 141 22,07 120 (Winter I 41 21,47 J 2 je Ursa: Min. 1 5 4 48,95 [ 50 0,50 31 9 Cephei 20 5 30,30 j 20 0,50 4 a UrsmMaj. 27 14. 31,50 [ 36, 0,50 5 Cephei 28 I2 12,35 | 20 050 6 a Cassiop. 29 22,83 _ 38 0,50 7 y Ursm Maj. 1 35 15 55,10 10 0,75 8 Dracois 38 29 3.73 68 0,25 9 1 ' Ursme Maj. j 39 44 57,80 | 50 ; 0,25 i0 I a Persei 40 48 52,37 26 1 0,50 tI Capella 44 12 20,96 37 J os5 a 2 C (ygni 45 2z 57,09 40 0!50 13j a Lyrm 51 23 0,72 70 0,25 141 Castorl 57 424 6,57 30 0,50 15 Pollux 61 3 1 56,57 | 31 0,50 i6 3 Tauri j 6z 33 43,t5 f 23 0!50 I7~ ac Andromeda 6: 56 29,61 1 35 0,50 i8 I a Cor.
