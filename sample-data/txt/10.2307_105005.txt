CXII. An Account of. some of the more rare English Plants observed in Leicestershire. To the Earl of Macclesfield, President of the ROYAL SOCIETY. My Lord, I Take the liberty, by your lordship's means, of communicating to the Royal Society an account of some of the more rare plants, growing spontaneously in Leicestershire, transmitted to me by its author, Mr. Richard Pultney, an apothecary at Leicester. Mr. Pultney is a person of real merit, well skilled not only in whatever relates to his profession, but also in various parts of Natural History. His botanical knowledge is very extensive, and he is very zealous in promoting it. He has already laid before the public, though his modesty would not permit Read Nov. 25, 1756. [804] permit him to subscribe his name thereto, a series of very curious and useful observations upon the vegetable poisons growing in England; the knowlege of which cannot be too much or too generally inculcated. The plants in the work, now put into your lordship's hands, are disposed according to the sexual system of Dr. Linnaeus, a very worthy member of this Society: but our author has not contented himself with a simple arrangement of the plants, the subject of his work; he has gone further, and has given us not only the synonymes of some of the best authors, but as far as his reading and observations have enabled him, their medical and ~economical uses and their places of growth. Nothing can more tend to the advancement of the natural history of this kingdom, than that persons conversant in the various parts of it, should collect the productions of their own neighbourhood, and transmit accounts thereof to the Royal Society. How much correspondence of this kind has already done, nothing can give a stronger testimony than the Synopsis Stirpium Britannicarnm of the late Mr. Ray; as this, joined to his own industry, enabled Mr. Ray to communicate to the public a more perfect account of the plants of this country than any other nation has yet seen. I shall make no apology for troubling your lordship with this, as I am well apprised how sure every performance is to meet with your lordship's patronage, which tends to promote the ends of the institution of that Society, over which you so very worthily preside. I have [805] I have the honour to be with the greatest deference and regard, My Lord, Your Lordship's most obliged, and obedient Servant, Lincolns-Inn-Fields, Nov. 24, 1756. W. Watson.

In stagnant and slow-running waters and in marshy places. This elegant plant is not common in these parts. It is found in the river Soar, near Loughborough; also in a little brook near the seat of the Rev. Granville Wheler, Esquire, at West Leke Nottinghamshire. This plant was soon discovered by the botanists, after the revival of learning, but they were at a great loss whither to refer it. Many of them took it for the Polygonum or Sanguinaria faemina of Dioscorides: at length it fell among the Equiseta or Horsetails; till Ruppius, Dillenius, and Vaillant, finding its parts of fructification very different from the Horsetails, called it by a different name, the former adopting the word Pinastella, and two the latter the old name Limnopeuce. The flower of this plant is perhaps the most simple in all nature. It has neither Calyx nor Petal, but consists only of one Stamen and one Pistil, followed by a single seed.

Veronica mas supina et vulgatissima C. B. 246. Raii Syn. 281. Male [807] Male Speedwell, or Fluellin, or True Paul's Betony. On dry barren Grounds, especially upon heaths, flowering in June. Upon Charley Forest sparingly. In Garenton Park. Upon the old walls in and about Buddon Wood near Quarndon. This is the true Veronica of the shops, which stands so well recommended by Hoffman, Boerhaave, and others, as an excellent and approved Deobstruent. What is sold for it in the shops here in the country, by the common herb-gatherers is the Veronica pratensis minor of Gerard and Parkinson, called Little or Smooth Fluellin or Paul's Betony, which is abundantly more common than the true sort. It is not long since the Veronica was a fashionable remedy for the gout, some taking it in the form of tea, and others the powder of the dried leaves. Veronica, racemis lateralibus, pedicellis pendulis, foliis linearibus integerrimis. Flor. Suec. 9. Sp. Plant. 12. Veronica aquatica angustifolia minor: Raii Syn. 280. Anagallis aquatica angustifolia scutellata C. B. p. 252. Narrow leaved Water Speedwell or Brooklime. By the banks of ditches and on the bogs flowering in May and June. This plant is very rare in these parts; I have only seen it in a moist place in one of the closes between Loughborough and Burley Hall. 5 K 2 PIN[808] PINGUICULA Gen. Plant. Plant. 28. Pinguicula nectario cylindraceo longitudine petali. Fl. Lap. 11. Sp. Pl. 17. Pinguicula Gesneri J. B. III. 546. Raii Syn. 289. Butterwort or Yorkshire Sanicle. In Bogs and Marshes flowering in June. In several of the moist closes about Buddon Wood. This plant is of a purging quality, and Parkinson relates, that the poorer people in Wales make a syrup of it, which they use as a purge, Theat. Bot. p. 534. It was long since observed to be hurtful to the sheep, and it appears from the result of the experiments in the Pan Suecus of Linnaeus, that neither the horses, goats, nor horned cattle will eat of it. Amaen. Acad. vol. ii. p. 238. The plant is of great use in the Lapland Oeconomy; see Fl. Lappon. p. 10. T R I A N D R I A monogynia. SCIRPUS Gen. Plant. 62.

In watery places about ditches, brooks, ponds, &c. flowering in July and August: Plentifully in an old pond in Sir Isaac Woolaston's park, at Loseby; and elsewhere, but not common. ERIO[809] ERIOPHORUM, Gen Pl. 63. Eriophorum culmis teretibus, foliis planis spicatis pedunculatis. Fl. Suec. 44. Sp. Pl. 52. Linagrostis foliis planis spicis multiplicibus Hall. Helv. p. 250. Linagrostis, Tabern. Raii Syn. p. 435. Cotton Grass. On bogs and marshes. Upon Charley Forest. In the closes about Woodhouse; near Buddon Wood, and elsewhere. Some of the poor people in Sweden for want of feathers fill their beds with the down of this grass, Fl. Lappon. p. 18. It seems applicable to other oeconomical uses; as its texture is very fine, and it may in our own country be gathered in great quantities in many places. NARDUS, Gen Pl. 65. Nardus spica setacea recta. Fl. Suec. 47. Sp. Plant. 53. Gramen sparteum juncifolium C. B. pin. R. Syn. 392. Hall. Helv. 203. Small Matweed. On dry barren heaths, and sometimes in marshes flowering in April; almost all over Charley Forest. Horses and other cattle, but especially the sheep, are fond of this grass; but it is seldom found among our hay, being too short for the scythe to reach. Digynia. AIRA, Gen. Pl. 75. Aira foliis setaceis: vaginis angulatis, floribus paniculato spicatis, flosculis basi aristatis. It. Scan. 226. Sp. Pl. 65. Gramen [810] Gramen parvum praecox panicula laxa canescente. R. Syn. Ed. 2. 260. Ed. 3. 407. Tab. 22. Fig. 2. bene. Pluk Alm 177 Tab. 33. Fig. 9. male. On dry barren ground, especially on gravelly foil, and not uncommon upon mud walls. I have observed it in several places about Leicester and Loughborough. Upon Beacon and Bardon hills, in Charley Forest more plentifully. It may be called small vernal grass with a loose whitish spike. MELICA, Gen. Pl. 76. Melica petalis imberbibus, panicula nutante simplici. Sp. Pl. p. 66.

Dipsacus [811] Dipsacus minor seu Virga Pastoris Ger. em. 1168. R. Syn. 192. Small Wild Teasel or Shepherd's Rod. On the banks of ditches about hedges especially in moist and undisturbed places, flowering in July and August. In the lanes about Garenton Park, sparingly. In Hollinghall Wood, near Loughborough, sparingly. Plentifully about the old pond in Sir Isaac Woollaston's Park, where the Cyperus Gramineus grows. ASPERULA, Gen. Plant. No.113. Asperula foliis octonis lanceolatis, fasciculis florum pedunculatis. Fl. Suec. 114. Sp. Plant. 103. Asperula Ger. 966. R. Syn. p. 224. Herb Woodroofe. In mountainous woods, and under bushes flowering in May. In Buddon, Okely, and Hollinghall Woods, near Loughborough. In the Stocking Wood near Leicester. Dr. Gmelin in the Petersburgh Acts, as he is quoted by Haller Enum. Stitp. Helv. p. 458. observes, that the fixed salt of this plant is a stronger alkaline than any other. The plant has a very agreable odour, and will drive away the moths, Amaen. Acad. Vol. I. p. 358. PLANTAGO, Gen. Plant. No.133. Plantago foliis linearibus dentatis, scapo tereti, Sp. Plant. p. 115. Plantago foliis laciniatis Coronopus dicta, R. Syn. 315. Coro4 [812] Coronopus sylvestris hirsutior C. B. pin. 190. On dry sandy grounds, and on heaths flowering in July. One of the hills in Charley Forest, near Sheepshead, called Ives Head, is almost covered over with it. It grows in Preswold Lanes, near Loughborough; also in a close the foot-way between Quorn and the turnpike. From the regular manner, in which the leaves of this plant are expanded upon the ground, it has been called by some the Star of the Earth; and much has been said relating to its virtues against the bite of a mad dog. See Phil. Trans. No. 187. also 457. ALCHEMILLA, Gen. Plant. No. 153. Alchemilla foliis lobatis. Fl. Suec. No. 135. Sp. Plant. p. 123. Alchemilla Ger. 802. R. Syn. 158. Ladies Mantle. In mountainous meadows and pastures flowering in May. It is not a common plant in these parts; I have observed it upon Charley Forest, near Beacon Hill; and in the moist closes at Woodhouse, near Buddon Wood. Dr. Haller, in his Iter Helveticum, attributes the extraordinary richness and plenty of the milk, in some parts of Switzerland, chiefly to this and two other plants common on their pastures; these are the narow-leaved Plantain and the Muttelina of Gesner and Camerarius. Opuscul Botan. p. 178. Digynia [813] Digynia. CUSCUTA, Gen. Plant. No. 156. Cuscuta floribus sessilibus, Sp. Plant. p. 124. Cuscuta major C. B. pin. 219. R. Syn. p. 281. Dodder. It is not a common plant in these parts. It is found upon the common nettle in some of the back lanes about Leicester. Dodder is really the same plant wherever it is found; though authors have been used to call it by as many different names as there are different plants upon which it is found. It is subject to variation in the colour of the stalks, which at first are yellowish, afterwards purple: the colour of the flower is variable too, and these accidents have been the sources of several species. M. Vaillant, though commonly averse to the multiplication of species, yet enumerates three kinds of Dodder in the Botanicon Parisiense, p. 43. But Linnaeus, Haller, and M. Dalibard agree in referring them all to the Cuscuta major of Caspar Bauhine here mentioned, which is really the only species found in Europe. Cuscuta tingit purpurascente colore, Amaen. Acad. vol. I. 359. P E N T A N D R I A monogynia. LITHOSPERMUM, Gen. Pl. No. 166. Lithospermum seminibus laevibus, corollis calycem vix superantibus, foliis lanceolatis. Hort. Cliff. 46. Sp. Plant. p. 132. VOL. 49. 5 L Lithos[814] Lithospermum seu milium solis J. B. III. 590. R. Syn. 228. Gromwell, Gromil, or Graymill. In dry uncultivated places by the way-sides, in lanes, &c. flowering in June. This is a scarce plant in these parts: I have only seen it on the edge of the Forest about Grace Dieu Park, and there but sparingly. The Lithospermum arvense or Bastard Alkanet is much more common but not so frequent as in Lincolnshire, where I have observed it among the corn about Grantham and Sleaford abundantly. HOTTONIA, Gen. Plant. No. 186. Hottonia. Boerh. Ind. alt. p. 207. R. Syn. 285. Hall. Helv. 487. Sp. Plant. p. 145. Millesolium aquaticum s. Viola aquatica caule nudo C. B. p. 141. Water Violet, Water Gillover, or Gilloflower. In stagnant and slow running waters and ditches flowering in April and May. Here and there in the River Soar, about Loughborough and Leicester but sparingly. It continues to grow in the places mentioned by Dr. Deering in the Catalogus Nottinghamensis. LYSIMACHIA, Gen Plant. No. 188. Lysimachia paniculata, recemis terminalibus. Sp. Plant. p. 146. Lysimachia lutea J. B. II. 901. R. Syn. 282. Yellow Willow Herb, or Loosestrife. In watery places about ditches and rivers, flowering in June. This is scarce in these parts. In a moist [815] moist place in the outwoods near Loughborough. I observed it also about a little brook by the highway on the London road, between Northampton and Newport, about four miles from Newport. Lysimachia foliis ovatis acutiusculis, pedunculis folio longioribus, caule repente, Sp. Plant. p. 148. Nummularia minor flore purpurascente, C. B. p. 310. Park. 555. R. Syn. p. 283. Purpleflowered Moneywort. On bogs and marshy grounds, flowering in June and July. In the boggy valleys in and about Charley Forest, and not sparingly. The Lysimachia nemorum Linnaei, or Yellow Pimpernel of the Woods, and the Nummularia, Moneywort, or Herb Twopence, are both more common with us than the foregoing. The purple-flowered Moneywort is one of those plants, which is almost peculiar to England and France; hence we wonder that Linnaeus has omitted it in his Flora Anglica. CAMPANULA, Gen. Plant. No. 201. Campanula foliis strictis: radicalibus lanceolato-ovalibus, panicula patula. Sp. Plant. 163. 4. Campanula esculentae facie ramis et floribus patulis Dill. Elth. 68. Tab. 58. The rigid leaved Bellflowers, with a diffusive panicle and patulous flowers. This plant is found pretty plentifully in Buddon Wood near Loughborough, and especially in some of the hedges and lanes adjoining. It flowers in July and August. 5 L 2 Dr. [816] Dr. Dillenius found this plant near Worcester, and took it for a Non-descript, though possibly it may be the plant, hinted at by Merret in his Pinax, under the appellation of Rapuntium flore purpureo. It has since been found in Sweden, though Linnaeus makes no mention of it in any of his works before the Species Plantarum: elsewhere we have no intelligence of it. We have no doubt but ours is the plant described by both these authors; but if I might be allowed the conjecture, I should think it was known to Parkinson, and is the plant, which he describes and figures under the title of Rapunculus nemorosus. Theat. Bot. p. 649. 650. He tells us that the plant he describes under that name grows naturally wild in England; and tho' his figure is very aukward, and his description very vague, yet both answer better to our plant than to any other of the Bell-flowers, which grow spontaneously in England. Parkinson took his plant to be the Rapunculus nemorosus of Tabernaemontanus and the Rapunculus campanulatus neriifolius tertius of Thalius, or the nemorosus angustifolius magno flore major of C. Bauhine pin. 93. No. 11. But M. Vaillant, (Bot. Paris. p. 27) and Dr. Haller (Enum. Stirp. Helv. p.494.) apply all these names to the Peach-leaved Bell-flower: hence if these two able botanists are right, Parkinson must have been mistaken, as the Peach leaved Campanula, which he describes and figures likewise in the same chapter, is not a native of England. Whence comes it that professor Linnaeus in the Flora Anglica has referred his trivial name of the plant [817] plant in question to the Rapunculus esculentus or Common Rampions of Ray's Syn. p. 277. No. 4. and that he has in the same piece omitted this last plant, although he mentions it in the Species Plantarum, p. 164. as a native of this island? Campanula caule angulato simplici, floribus sessilibus, capitulo terminali. Vir. cliff. 16. Sp. Pl. 166. Campanula pratensis flore conglomerato, C.B. pin. 94. Raii Syn. 277. Little Throatwort or Canterbury Bells. In mountainous places, especially in a chalky soil. It flowers in July. This plant is very scarce in this county; I have observed it about Grantham, Ancaster, and Sleaford, in Lincolnshire, very plentifully. Campanula caule basi subramoso stricto, foliis oblongis crenatis, calycibus aggregatis corolla longioribus, capsulis prismaticis, Sp. Pl. p. 168. Campanula arvensis erecta vel Speculum Veneris minus Ger. em. 439. Park. 1331. Raii Syn. p. 278. The lesser Venus Looking-glass, or codded Corn Violet. Among the corn flowering in June and July. This I observed pretty plentifully among the corn for four or five years successively near Loughboborough. Dr. Haller takes this to be only a variety of the common Venus Looking-glass of the Gardens, and has put it down as such in the Enum. Stirp. Helv. p. 496. and though Linnaeus makes it distinct, he doubts whether it be not originally sprung from the same plant. SAMO[818] SAMOLUS, Gen. Plant. 205. Samolus, Hort. Cliff. 51. Fl. Suec. 165. Sp. Plant. 171. Anagallis aquatica folio non crenato, C.B. pin. 252. Round leaved Water Pimpernel. In marshes flowering in June. This is very scarce in these parts: I have seen it in the outwoods, and in Buddon Wood, near Loughborough; also upon several bogs near Charley Forest. ATROPA Gen. Plant. No. 222. Atropa caule herbaceo foliis ovatis integris. Sp. Plant. p. 181. Bella Donna Clus. Raii Syn. 264. Dwale, or Deadly Nightshade. It flowers in May. About Grace Dieu Abbey in this county, but sparingly. About North Luffenham in Rutland. The intoxicating and poisonous quality of this herb is well known, and too many dreadful instances of its effects are to be found in various authors. See Matthiolus Comment. in Dioscorid. p. 756. Edit. 1598. Gerard em. p. 341. Bodaeus a stapel in Theophrast. p. 586. Wepfer Hist. Cicut. aquat. cap. 17. Boerhaave Hist. Plant. Lugd. Bat. p. 510. The memorable story of the intoxication of the Danes by the Scots, as it is related by Buchanan Rer. Scot. lib. 7. is quoted by almost all succeeding writers, when mentioning this plant. Later instances of its bad effects may be seen in the Gentleman's Magazine for August and September 1747; also in the Magazine for September 1748. See also the case of two children and [819] and their father; the former of which died, and the latter narrowly escaped, by eating the berries of this plant. Hill's British Herbal, p. 329. Dr. Haller quotes several authors both antient and modern to prove its deleterious quality. Enum. Stirp. Helv. p. 507. As pernicious, however, as this plant has generally proved, when taken unwarily, there are gentlemen in the medical way, who have dared to administer it internally in one of the most formidable diseases incident to human nature: this is nothing less than the cancer. In the year 1739, there was a thesis published at Hall in Saxony, tending to prove it a specific in the cancer. Since then it has been administered in a case of that kind with the greatest success. This case is related in a very circumstantial manner and with the greatest appearance of candor and ingenuity, in the Bithiotheque Des Sciences et des Beaux Arts, for the first three months of the 1755. One successful case is far from being sufficient to establish the credit of a new medicine; but the result of that case seems to render it worthy of a farther trial: and happy will it be for a miserable part of mankind, if it be hereafter attended with the same success.

The Black-berry bearing Alder. In [820] In moist woods flowering in April and May. In the outwoods near Loughborough plentifully. In Buddon Wood. The inner bark of this tree, especially of the root, is a violent purge. Haller observes, that the charcoal of the wood of this tree is preferable to others for making of gunpowder. Enum. Stirp. Helv. 164. and it is used for that purpose in Sweden, Fl. Suec. p. 68. Amaen. Acad. V. I. p. 360. The berries of this tree will strike a good green, as Buckthorn berries do, and the inner bark will give a yellow dye. ibid. Digynia. GENTIANA, Gen. Plant. No. 285. Gentiana corollis quinquefidis hypocrateri-formibus, fauce barbatis. Sp. Plant. p. 230. Gentiana pratensis flore lanuginoso C. B. pin. 188. Raii Syn. 275. Dwarf Autumnal Gentian, or Fellwort. In dry mountainous pastures especially where the soil is chalky. It flowers in August. In the pastures about East Leke, Nottinghamshire, but sparingly. The Vernal Dwarf Gentian, said, in the Synopsis, p. 275, to be found by Mr. Fitz Roberts near Kendal, is a mistake, arising from the autumnal Gentian being observed to flower sooner than common: hence it does not appear, that that plant has yet been found in England. See Wilson's Synopsis of British Plants, p. 135. 4 The [821] The Gentiana perfoliata Linnaei, or Yellow Centory, continues to grow where Dr. Deering mentions it near Nottingham. TORDYLIUM, Gen.

Meadow Saxifrage. This plant is very plentifully found in most of our moist meadows and pastures, and not unfrequentVOL. 49. 5 M ly [822] ly on the higher grounds. It flowers in May and June. This plant is omitted by Linnaeus in the Flora Anglica, although it is one of those which is found as plentifully here as in any other part of Europe. SIUM, Gen. Plant. 310.

This [823] This plant has been in great repute in Germany, and particularly Heister has given great commendations of it. It is used externally for discussing tumours of the schirrous kind, and in cataplasms for cancers and gangrenes. It has the character of being poisonous; and it has been observed, that if horses eat of it, it will occasion a paraplegia: on the other hand, the cows are fond of it, and eat it without any ill consequence.

About the banks of rivers and ponds, and in marshes, flowering in July and August. This is not common with us: I have only observed it in the pool in Nottingham park, especially at the upper end towards the rock-holes. Many and dreadful are the instances, of the fatal effects of this plant; as not only Wepfer's treatise, but many other papers in the various periodical productions of Europe, evidently prove. Dr. Haller refers to several, Enum. Stirp. Helv. p. 436. See also the Philosophical Transactions, N~. 480. When Linnaeus was at Tornoa, upon the Lapland expedition, he discovered to the inhabitants, that the great destruction of their horned cattle, in the spring, when they were first turned out, 5 M 2 and [824] and when it was no uncommon thing-for an hundred of them to perish, was intirely owing to this plant, which is very common in their pastures. Flor. Lappon. p. 72. The Flora Suecica confirms the same effects upon the horned cattle. p. 84. Dr. Gmelin, who observed it in the marshes almost all over Russia and Sibiria, tells us, that the people there universally affirm, that the horses eat it without any subsequent ill consequence; but that it infallibly kills the horned cattle, and that they swell very much before they die; which symptom Linnaeus had remarked in those that perished at Tornoa. The inhabitants say likewise, that the root of the plant is abundantly more poisonous than the leaves. See Flora Sibirica, Vol. I. p. 203. PIMPINELLA, Gen. Plantar. N~. 328.

Great Burnet Saxifrage. In woods, and among bushes in shady places, flowering in July. In Hallinghall Wood near Loughborough. In Stocking Wood, and the hedges adjoining, near Leicester. The Pimpinella saxisraga minor is very common with us in dry pastures, and upon banks, about hedges Linnaeus, Royen, and Ludwig, join these two species together, on supposition that they do not differ [825] differ essentially. Haller keeps them separate, as not having seen the effect of culture upon them. Great deference is due to the opinion of such eminent botanists, and who have had such great opportunities for observation: the difference however is very remarkable, and we have seen them in the fields keeping that difference, when growing together upon the same soil. The root of this plant is one of the ingredients in the Pulvis Ari compositus of the shops, and is a simple much esteemed by some of the German physicians, particularly by the followers of Stahl. Very few of our herb-gatherers know this plant, but produce the root of the common Sanguisorba or Burnet, or those of meadow Saxifrage, for it. Tetragynia. PARNASSIA, Gen. Plant. No. 345.

The common Tormentil is so very frequently found in a procumbent state, that persons not much acquainted with plants, might easily mistake it for this species, without some other distinctive note: hence we wonder, that Linnaeus did not form his specific names of these two plants rather from their cauline leaves, than from their manner of growing; those of the common Tormentil being generally quite sessile, or close to the stalk; whereas those of this species are constantly petiolated. The former might then have been calledTormentilla foliis caulinis sessilibus, and the latter Tormentilla foliis caulinis petiolatis. The distinction from their manner of growing might have been added too; but it would be almost needless, and therefore contrary to our illustrious author's own rule in the Fundamenta Botanica, No. 291.

This plant is subject to great variation, and seems to us to have been divided by many authors into several species. We have observed, that in the woods it grows more branched, having many more leaves, which are also broader, of a darker colour, and the flowers of a paler yellow, than when the plant is found upon open places. We are well assured that this is the plant mentioned by Dr. Deering in the Catalogus Nottinghamensis, for the narrow-leaved golden Lungwort, having seen it in the places referred to by him; nor have we seen any plant hereabouts which answers to the descriptions and synonymes of the Pulmonaria gallica or murorum of Linnaeus.

Also upon the rocks near Thrinkston. The Lichen hirtus, and floridus Linnaei are both found in our Woods. Several of the mosses belonging to this extensive Genus enter into oeconomical and medicinal uses; in the latter province the Cup-moss and the Horned moss have been celebrated in inveterate coughs, especially the former in the chincough of Children; and Lungwort has been no less famous in Consumptions. The present practice, however, regards them but very little, except the ash-coloured ground Liverwort introduced into practice by Dr. Mead. Their oeconomical uses are much more extensive: The orcella forms a branch of trade on account of its use in dying: but it is not the only species that is capable of being applied that way; there are others, which will tinge a purple and yellow colour: and it is to be wished that experiments were made with some of them for that purpose, as they are so plentifully found in our own nation. The common coralline moss is the principal food of the Rein-Deer, in winter, in the northern countries of Lapland, and even with this alone will they frequently become fat. We have hints of several other oeconomical uses of this tribe of plants in the Flora Oeconomica, Amaen. Acad. Vol. I. taken from Linnaeus's Itinera; which books we are deprived of the pleasure of reading on account of their being wrote in the Swedish tongue. Amidst the great variety of books much less useful and entertaining, it is greatly to be regretted that they are not likewise translated into a language more universally known.
