VJI. Second Essay on a General Method in Dynamics. By WILLIAM ROWAN HAMILTON, Member of several Scientjfic Societies in Great Britain and in Foreign Countries, Andrews' Professor of Astronomy in the University of Dublin, and Royal Astronomer of Ireland. Communicated by Captain BEAUFORT, R.N. F.R.S. Received October 29, 1834,-Read January 15, 1835. introductory Remarks. THE former Essay* contained a general method for reducing all the most important problems of dynamics to the study of one characteristic function, one central or radical relation. It was remarked at the close of that Essay, that many eliminations required by this method in its first conception, might be avoided by a general transformation, introducing the time explicitly into a part S of the whole characteristic function V; and it is now proposed to fix the attention chiefly on this part S, and to call it the Principal Function. The properties of this part or function S, which were noticed briefly in the former Essay, are now more fully set forth; and especially its uses in questions of perturbation, in which it dispenses with many laborious and circuitous processes, and enables us to express accurately the disturbed configuration of a system by the rules of undisturbed motion, if only the initial components of velocities be changed in a suitable manner. Another manner of extending rigorously to disturbed motion the rules of undisturbed, by the gradual variation of elements, in number double the number of the coordinates or other marks of position of the system, which was first invented by LAGRANGE, and was afterwards improved by POISSON, is considered in this Second Essay under a form perhaps a little more general; and the general method of calculation which has already been applied to other analogous questions in optics and in dynamics by the author of the present Essay, is now applied to the integration of the equations which determine these elements. This general method is founded chiefly on a combination of the principles of variations with those of partial differentials, and may furnish, when it shall be matured by the labours of other analysts, a separate branch of algebra, which may be called perhaps the Calculus of Principal Functions; because, in all the chief applications of algebra to physics, and in a very extensive class of purely mathematical questions, it reduces the determination of many mutually connected functions to the search and study of one principal or central relation. When applied to the integration of the equations of varying elements, it suggests, as is now shown, the consideration* Philosophical Transactions for the year 1834, Second Part. 96 PROFESSOR HAMILTON ON A GENERAL METHOD IN DYNAMICS. of a certain Function of Elements, which may be variously chosen, and may either be rigorously determined, or at least approached to, with an indefinite accuracy, by a corollary of the general method. And to illustrate all these new general processes, but especially those which are connected with problems of perturbation, they are applied in this Essay to a very simple example, suggested by the motions of projectiles, the parabolic path being treated as the undisturbed. As a more important example, the problem of determining the motions of a ternary or multiple system, with any laws of attraction or repulsion, and with one predominant mass, which was touched upon in the former Essay, is here resumned in a new way, by forming and integrating the differential equations of a new set of varying elements, entirely distinct in theory (though little differing in practice) from the elements conceived by LAGRANGE, and having this advantage, that the differentials of all the new elements for both the disturbed and disturbing masses may be expressed by the coefficients of one disturbing function. Transformations of the Differential Equations of Motion of an Attracting or Repelling System. 1. It is well known to mathematicians, that the differential equations of motion of any system of free points, attracting or repelling one another according to any functions of their distances, and not disturbed by any foreign force, may be comprised in the following formula: E.m (x"x +y'i+ z z)-:... . . . (1.) the sign of summation :? extending to all the points of the system; m being, for any one such point, the constant called its mass, and x y z being its rectangular coordinates; while x"y" Z" are the accelerations, or second differential coefficients taken with respect to the time, and ; x9 w y, b z are any arbitrary infinitesimal variations of those coordinates, and U is a certain force-function, introduced into dynamics by LAGRANGE, and involving the masses and mutual distances of the several points of the system. If the number of those points be ?n, the formula (L.) may be decomposed into 3 n ordinary differential equations of the second order, between the coordinates and the time, x = ;. m.. (2) and to integrate these differential equations of motion of an attracting or repelling system, or some transformations of these, is the chief and perhaps ultimately tile only problem of mathematical dynamics. 2. To facilitate and generalize the solution of this problem, it is useful to express previously the 3 n rectangular coordinates x y z as functions of 3 n other and more general marks of position '1 '2 ... n3 n ; and then the differential equations of motion take this more general form, discovered by LAGRANGE, PROFESSOR, HAMILTON ON A GENERAL METHOD IN DYNAMICS. 97 d aT aT aU dt -J ('i Ii = 8 di * * . * * ' *;1 . . .

And all these 62n functions, or 6 nr relations to determine them, may be expressed, with perfect generality and rigour, by the metbod of the former Essay, or by the following simplified process. Integration of the Equations of Motion, by means of one Principal Function. 4.

(21.) that is by the equations of motion (A.), ~S'dn+ d .(22.) (gdti dt 88=dt g ;*......(2) the variation of the integral S is therefore t 8 N (a 3 on-p. .e), e . (23.) (p and e being still initial values,) and it decomposes itself into the following 6 n expressions, when S is considered as a function of the 6 it quantities 4i e,, (involving also the time,) a S a S I '0rl an1; PI = ej; a S a S W = ~Pm = J &SS n a r P3Pn 2e .S n .(B) which are evidently forms for the sought integrals of the 6 n differential equations of motion (A.), containing only one unknown function S. The difficulty of mathematical dynamics is therefore reduced to the search and study of this one function S, which may for that reason be called the PRINCIPAL FUNCTION of motion of a system. This function S was introduced in the first Essay under the form S = (T + U) d t, the symbols T and U having in this form their recent meanings; and it is worth observing, that when S is expressed by this definite integral, the conditions for its variation vanishing (if the final and initial coordinates and the time be given) are precisely the differential equations of motion (3.), under the forms assigned by LAGRANGE. The variation of this definite integral S has therefore the double property, of giving the differential equations of mnotion for any transformed coordinates when the extreme positions are regarded as fxed, and of giving the integrals of those differenti'al equations when the extreme positions are treated as varying. 5. Although the function S seems to deserve the name here given it of Principal Function, as serving to express, in what appears the simplest way, the integrals of the equations of motion, and the differential equations themselves; yet the same analysis conducts to other functions, which also may be used to express the integrals of the same equations. Thus, if we put Q J-: >. + J) d . (24.) and take the variation of this integral Q without varying t or dt, we find, by a similar process, o 2 100 PROFESSOR HAMILTON ON A GENERAL METHOD IN DYNAMICS. so that if we consider Q as a function of the 6 n quantities zX p. and of the time, We shall have 6 n expressions aQ aQ o~i = ski'ej = -si . . 26.) which are other forms for the integrals of the equations of motion (A.), involving the function Q instead of S. We might also employ the integral v-f N t dt= fs dn, . . . . . . . . . (27.) which was called the Characteristic Function in the former Essay, and of which, when considered as a function of the 6 n + 1 quantities ;7 e. H, the variation is V pv ... ^ (28.) And all these functions S, Q, V, are connected in such a way, that the forms and properties of any one may be deduced from those of any other. Investigation of a Pair of Partial Differential Equations of the first Order, which the Principal Function must satisfy. 6. In forming the variation (23.), or the partial differential coefficients (B.), of the Principal Function S, the variation of the time was omitted; but it is easy to calcu-i late the coefficient as corresponding to this variation, since the evident equation d S aS aS dn dta*.. . (29.) gives, by (20.)., and by (A.), (B.), t = S .H. (30.) It is evident also that this coefficient, or the quantity H, is constant, so as not to alter during the motion of the system; because the differential equations of mo-t tion (A.) give dlH _ aH dnaH dFy_ do \84 do + 0.d -'*ff (31.)r If, therefore, we attend to the equation (17.), and observe that the function F is necessarily rational and integer and homogeneous of the second dimension with respect to the quantities wi, we shall perceive that the principal function S must satisfy the two following equations between its partial differential coefficients of the first order, which offer the chief means of discovering its form: AS(+ F67S AS A ' 1 a + F e1' n * * * . . e* ) = U (es, C2, . .

If we separate the principal function S into any two parts, S1 + S2 = S. . . . (34.) and substitute their sum for S in the first equation (C.), the function F, fromn its rational and integer and homogeneous form and dimension, may be expressed in this new way, F( I, .a,4 .. .,1) = F(s1 .a . asn asn a 1'l a n4 Fa SI as, 2 + +as ( 3l) (35) =F "(aS s n2 .. 7 aS2n) becaulse \a41/a41~ , F' xa43~ as (as\ _ F' F a41) -i V ) -Ftk S),. * * (36.) and Y . a_2_ a S2 =2F (, as 2 ' (37a) and since, by (A.) and (B.), 102 PROFESSOR HAMILTON ON A GENERAL METHOD IN DYNAMICS. at{ S a tt)_8H _dCjX V8 (i} Vt dt) = .~ = . w . . .(38.) we easily transform the first equation (C.) to the following, dS 8S1 \ ' F(8S1 S1 a S( S2 aS2 d at (1n'71)-F'73-n)8 aI-n8+F8il K4n 1 nl vhich gives rigorously S2=; I-a + U SIl tsz8?

This general and rigorous transformation offers a genesral method of improving ail approxitnate expression for the principal function S, in any problem of dynamics. For if the part SI be such an approximate expression, then the remaining part S2 will be small; and the homogeneous function F involving the squares and products of the coefficients of this small part, in the second definite integral (E.), will be in general also small, and of a higher order of smallness; we may therefore in general neglect this second definite integral, in passing to a second approximation, and may in general improve a first approximate expression S8 by adding to it the following correction, ,A SI a Si , U (i,,.n 7 rsjF(a SI 5. )}dt; (F.) in calculating which definite integral we may employ the following approximate forms for the integrals of the equations of motion, ak SI a SI aSI PI =-el) P2 =--,eS' Psg,= bes (39.) expressing first, by these, the variables ni as functions of the time andI of the 6 n constants ej Pi, and then eliminating, after the integration, the 3 n quantities pi, bythe same approximate forms. And when an improved expression, or second approxi -'ate value SI + A S1, for the principal function S, has been thus obtained, it nray be substituted in like manner for the first approximate value Si, so as to obtain a still closer approximation, and the process may be iepeated indefinitely. An analogous process applies to the indefinite improvenient of a first approxim'at expression for the function Q or V.

Whenever then, by a proper choice of the predominant term IH1, a system of 6 n equations such as (H.) has been formed and rigorously integrated, giving expressions for the 6 n variables ;7i m as functions of the time t, and of their own initial values ej pi, which may be thus denoted: = A (1, e1, e2, . . e3 nnp1, fp2,> * .psn), ' e ' ,,,,,, . . 43 c (44.) and w'-a ~= (t, el, e2, *eS PP2. n) P .

To accomplish this passage, let us observe that the differential equations of undisturbed motion (F.), being of the same form, as the original equations (A.), may have their integrals si iilarly expressed, that is, as follovs: iH = c SI = t SI c ^ * * 81, being here the principalfunetion of and'tuirbed niotion,, or the definite integral S1.

Comparing the forms (44.) with the second set of equations (1.) for the integrals of undisturbed motion, we find that the following relations between the functions pi 83 must be rigorously and identically true: = Ah (toe e2, * . e3s eee a -e3 n'.

We might deduce from it the differential coefficients n'j, or the connected quantities saon which determine the disturbed directions and velocities of motion at any time t; but a similar reasoning gives at once the general expression, ,>i88 2 +ph (t, el, e2, ( . ) implying, that after altering the initial velocities and directions or the elements p. as before, by the perturbational terms (M.), we may then employ the rules of undisturbed motion (45.) to calculate the velocities and directions at the time t, or the varying quantities zv, if we finally apply to these quantities thus calculated the following new corrections for perturbation: ~S2 A S2~ 2O. 6nj1 2 n 2 3 *n ~ * * @ * @( .3~ ~ ~~~~~~(. Approximate expressions deducedfrom the foregoing rigorous Theory. 10. The foregoing theory gives indeed rigorous expressions for the perturbations, in passing from the simpler motion (H.) or (I.) to the more complex motion (G.) or (K.): but it may seem that these expressions are of little use, because they involve an unknown disturbing function S2, (namely, the perturbational part of the whole principal function N,) and also unknown or disturbed coordinates or marks of position ai. However, it was lately shown that whenever a first approximate form for the principal function S, such as here the principal function S1 of undisturbed motion, has been found, the correction S2 can in general be assigned, with an indefinitely increasing PROFESSOR HAMILTON ON A GENERAL METHOD IN DYNAMICS. 105 accuracy; and since the perturbations (M.) and (0.) involve the disturbed coordinates ni only as they enter into the coefficients of this small disturbing function 82, it is evidently permitted to substitute for these coordinates, at first, their undisturbed values, and then to correct the results by substituting more accurate expressions. 11. The function S1 of undisturbed motion must satisfy rigorously two partial differential equations of the form (C.), namely, a t Fl a8N. **a an Zln * * .. 43R n) U1 (4/1 * * 3 0)) at +e F 5( .. a 8e3 n5 el . . .* en) U, (elm , ... e~n); and therefore, by (D.), the disturbing function S2 must satisfy rigorously the following other condition: dSU (, * F2 l * * 17 * 3n +) F(8 * an3 .15 * * (Q.) and may, on account of the homogeneity and dimension of F, be approximately expressed as follows: 82 .1Ct{U(t I1s -F2 (% N .2. ) }dt, . . .

In this expression, 12 is given immediately as a function of the varying quantities ni Wi but it may be considered in the same order of approximation as a known funck tion of their initial values ei Pi and of the time t, obtained by substituting for n. w. their undisturbed values (44.) (45.) as functions of those quantities; its variation may therefore be expressed in either of the two following ways: b~~~ ~~~ a[ ( j__H2 a,., ........(48.) or b2 H (% H2 e + 8 p) + t. (49.) Adopting the latter view, and effecting the integration (T.) with respect to the time, by treating the elements e. pi as constant, we are afterwards to substitute for the quantities pi their undisturbed expressions (39.) or (I.), and then we find for the variation of the disturbing function 82 the expression S2 H2 x t + e x. 2 d t + e a 2 dt MDC C CXXXV. p~~~~ 0 106 PROFESSOR HAMILTON ON A GENERAL METHOD IN DYNAMICS. which enables us to transform the perturbational terms (M.)

It would not be difficult to calculate, in like manner, approximate expressions for the disturbed directions and velocities at any time t; but it is better to resume, in another way, the rigorous problem of perturbation. Other Rigorous Theory of Perturbation, founded on the properties of the disturbing part of the constant of living force, and giving fornwulc for the Variation of Elements more analogous to those already known. 13. Suppose that the theory of undisturbed motion has given the 6 n constants e. pi or any combinations of these, Ze x2, . . Z6, as functions of the 6 n variables zir. and of the time t, which may be thus denoted: Zi = Xi (t5 4Dn 42~ n*, W 79Vn an 2n* ,)n * (54.) and which give reciprocally expressions for the variables 4f fi in terms of these elements and of the time, analogous to (44.) and (45.), and capable of being denoted similarly, (Pi = (t, ZDn 21 . . .

In passing to disturbed motion, if we retain the equation (54.) as a definition of the quantity zx, that quantity will no longer be constant, but it will continue to satisfy the inverse relations (55.), and may be called, by analogy, a varying element of the motion; and its total differential coefficient, taken with respect to the time, may, by the identical equation (56.), and by the differential equations of disturbed motion (G.), be rigorously expressed as follows: ).i_ E {e~j AH2 _ e~i AH2 (Al.) dt 6n) aw as 8 n * * * * * * * v * * 14. This result (Al.) contains the whole theory of the gradual variation of the elements of disturbed motion of a system; but it may receive an advantageous transformation, by the substitution of the expressions (55.) for the variables 4i zi as functions of the time and of the elements; since it will thus conduct to a system of 6 n 108 PROFESSOR HAMILTON ON A GENERAL METHOD IN DYNAMICS. rigorous and ordinary differential equations of the first order between those varying elements and the time. Expressing, therefore, the quantity H2 as a function of these latter variables, its variation b 1-12 takes this new form, H2 z . .+ t.. .

Now it is remarkable that this elimination removes the symbol t also, and leaves the coefficients ai expressed as functions of the elements z alone, not explicitly involving the time. This general theorem of dynamics, which is, perhaps, a little more extensive than the analogous results discovered by LAGRANGE and by POISSON, since it does not limit the disturbing terms in the differential equations of motion to depend on the configuration only, may be investigated in the following way. 15. The sign of summation z in (C'.), like the same sign in those other analogous equations in which it has already occurred without an index in this Essay, refers not to the expressed indices, such as here i, s, in the quantity to be summed, but to an index which is not expressed, and which may be here called r; so that if we introd(ice for greater clearness this variable index and its limits, the expression (C'.) becomes n / x. ax x. ax a. ~~~~~ IS j..59. aiS~~~n (7' W o r 6 zr a nr and its total differential coefficient, taken with respect to the time, may be separated into the two following parts, I ax--ax d ?sn / .3 n i d ax5 sX d xo W-t is, A~ 'nr dt~v aw 'r dt asJ (0 r (xs d axi axi d ax >6 ?

(75.) But it has been proved that these coefficients a4 ,, when expressed as functions of the elements, do not contain the time explicitly; and the supposition t = 0 introduces no relation between those 6 n elements zi xi, which still remain independent: the coefficients ai 5, therefore, could not acquire the values 1, 0, -1, by the supposition t = 0, unless they had those values constantly, and independently of that supposition. The differential equations of the forms (B'.), may therefore be expressed, for the present system of varying elements in the following simpler way: dx. _ AH d~i _ A___r(1., d A d x X(G and an easy verification of these expressions is offered by the formula (El.), which takes now this form, 8He d x a H2 dAX 1QU d2 ~ 2 dX 0. ..(HI'.) aex dit+ ax dtl-* ** ******* (1 17. The initial values of the varying elements xi X, are evidently e, pi, by the definitions (72.), and by the identical equations (71.) ; the problem of integrating rigorously the equations of disturbed motion (G.), between the variables 7i ad and the time, or of determining these variables as functions of the time and of their own initial values ei Pi, is therefore rigorously transformed into the problem of integrating the equations (G'.), or of determining the 6 n elements s xui as functions of the time and of the same initial values. The chief advantage of this transformation is that if the perturbations be small, the new variables (namely, the elements,) alter but little: and that, since the new differential equations are of the same form as the old, they may be integrated by a similar method.

And each of these functions of elements, C and E, must satisfy a certain partial differential equation, analogous to the first equation of each pair mentioned in the sixth number of this Essay, and deduced on similar principles. 18. Thus, it is evident, by the form of the function E, and by the equations (KI.), (GI.), and (76.), that the partial differential coefficient of this function, taken with respect to the time, is a E dE aE dx at dt if sx dt= H2, (Ml.) and therefore that if we separate this function E into any two parts E. + E2 = E, (N'.) and if, for greater clearness, we put the expression H2 under the form H2 = 2 (t, ZD, X21 ~n71 72n 3 Jt~)) Iwe shall have rigorously the partial differential equation 0 = aiE + sE2 + H2 (t5 ZCD * 3n3 a xI + a xi, a x~n + F" 3n (pi) which gives, approximately, by (GI.) and (K'.), when the part E2 is small, and when we neglect the squares and products of its partial differential coefficients, o = dE2 + atE + H2 (to "D *.(Q'3n) ax, ) a * * .

Analogous formul? for the motion of a Single Point. 19. Our general method in dynamics, though intended chiefly for the study of attracting and repelling systems, is not confined to such, but may be used in all questions to which the law of living forces applies. And all the analysis of this Essay, but especially the theory of perturbations may usefully be illustrated by the following analogous reasonings and results respecting the motion of a single point. Imagine then such a point, having for its three rectangular coordinates x y a, and moving in an orbit determined by three ordinary differential equations of the second order of forms analogous to the equations (2.), namely, a, u; au_ aU t u 7 i= , y"l (V -. 8 Z Y ay XJ 2 a e is * ( 8) U being any given function of the coordinates not expressly involving the time: and let us establish the following definition, analogous to (4.), T = 1 (x'2 + y'2 + z12), . . . . . (79.) r' y' Z being the first, and x" y" Z" being the second differential coefficients of the coordinates, considered as functions of the time t. If we express, for greater generality or facility, the rectangular coordinates x y z as functions of three other marks of position 41 ;2 43, T will become a homogeneous function of the second dimension of their first differential coefficients n'l 4'2 43 taken with respect to the time and if we put, for abridgement, a T AT a T =U 2 F Y = ~, . . . . . . . . .

Returning now from this simpler motion to the more complex motion first mentioned, and denoting by Sa the disturbing part or function which must be added to S, in order to make up the whole principal function S of that more complex motion; we have, by applying our general method, the following rigorous expression for this disturbing function, t t S22 2 S2 =-X H2 d t + t0 g n{ ) + QS2) + (a2) }d in which we may, approximately, neglect the second definite integral, and calculate the first by the help of the equations of undisturbed motion.

Of these two functions either may be employed, and we shall use here the function C. 29.

Accordingly, these rigorous expressions for the 6 varying elements, in the present dynamical question, agree with the results obtained by the ordinary methods of integration from the 6 ordinary differential equations (150.) and (151.), and with those obtained by elimination from the equations (113.) (114.) (147.). Remarks on the foregoing Example. 30. The example which has occupied us in the last six numbers is not altogether ideal, but is realised to some extent by the motion of a projectile in a voicd. For if we consider the earth as a sphere, of radius R, and suppose the accelerating force of gravity to vary inversely as the square of the distance r from Its centre, and to be g at the surface, this force will be represented generally by g ; and to adapt the differential equations (78.) to the motion of a projectile in a void, it will be sufficient to make UgR2Q( . _ ) . , . . . . . . . . a (173.) If we place the origin of rectangular coordinates at the earth's surface, and suppose the semiaxis of + z to be directed vertically upwards, we shall have r =,(R + ,) 2 + X2 +--2 Y 2 F (174L.) r=V(R gz2+ gx2+,y2), . . . (174.) and ~ ___ U g z + R QR ~~~~~~~~~~(175.) neglecting only those very small terms which have the square of the earth's radius for a divisor: neglecting therefore such terms, the force-function U in this question is of that form (110.) on which all the reasonings of the example have been founded; the small constants p, v, being the real and imaginary quantities \ I A/ R respectively. We may therefore apply the results of the recent numbers to the motions of projectiles in a void, by substituting these values for the constants, and altering, where necessary, trigonometrical to exponential functions. But besides the theoretical facility and the little practical importance of researches respecting such projectiles, the results would only be accurate as far as the first negative power (inclusive) of the earth's radius, because the expression (110.) for the force-function U is only accurate so far; and therefore the rigorous and approximate investigations of the six preceding numbers, founded on that expression, are offered only as mathematical illustrations of a general method, extending to all problems of dynamics, at least to all those to which the law of living forces applies. SAttracting Systems resumed: Differential Equations of internal or Relative Motion ; Integration by the Principal Function. 31. Returning now from this digression on the motion of a single point, to the more important study of an attracting or repelling system, let us resume the differential equations (A.), which may be thus summed up: PROFESSOR HAMILTON ON A GENERAL METHOD IN DYNAMICS. 131 d t 1.I-.

The following is another way of effecting as great a simplification, at least for that extensive class of cases in which the undisturbed distance between the two points of each binary system (in, M) admits of a minimum value.

In general, it appears to be a useful rule, though not always followed by alnalysts, to employ the real radical symbol VR only for positive quantities, unless the negative sign be expressly prefixed; and then will denote positive or negative unity according as r is positive or negative. The arc given by its sine, in the expression of the element a, is supposed to be so chosen as to increase continually with the time. 35. After these remarks on the notation, let us apply the formula (P2.) to calculate the values of the 15 combinations such as {z, X}, of the 6 constants or elements (Q2.). Since r = v (2 + 2 + 42) X . . . . (187.) it is easy to perceive that the six combinations of the 4 first elements are as follows: IZI XI 05 { P}1 = 0,1 f{z) VI = 0, {x) Hi=0, fx) >} In, {fn = 0. . (188.) To form the 4 combinations of these 4 first elements with A, we may observe, that this 5th element A, as expressed in (Q2.), involves explicitly (besides the time) the distance r, and the two elements z, p; but the combinations already determined show that these two elements may be treated as constant in forming the four combinations now sought; we need only attend, therefore, to the variation of r, and if we interpret by the rule (P2.) the symbols {z, r} {ir} {,r} , r}, and attend to the equations (12.), we see that {z, r} = 0, {fX, r} = 0, {f,r} =-j r {vr}O = 0,. . . .

It remains to calculate the 5 combinations of these 5 elements with the last element a; which is given by (Q2.) as a function of the distance r, the coordinate 4, and the 4 elements x, x, A, v; so that we may employ this formula, fe f e 8g{ni e }+x {e, A}+v e A e }, (192.)

(202.) r, being any quantity which does not vary with the elements x and I; we might therefore at once conclude by (199.) that the combination {r, c} vanishes, if a diffiMDCCCxxxv. Tn 138 PROFESSOR. HAMILTON ON A -GENERAL METHOD IN DYNAMICS. culty were not occasioned by the necessity of varying the lower limit q, which depends on those two elements, and by the circumstance that at this lower limit the coefficients 0,. 2, become infinite. However, the relation (202.) shows that we may express this combination Pr, c4 as follows: {, WI } j ?d rd + fiJq r d * * * * * * * (203.) r, being an auxiliary and arbitrary quantity, which cannot really affect the result, but may be made to facilitate the calculation; or in other words' we may assign to the distance r any arbitrary value, not varying for infinitesimal variations of Z, AS which may assist in calculating the value of the expression (199.). We may therefore suppose that the increase of distance r -q is small, and corresponds to a small positive interval of time t r, during which the distance r and its differential coefficient r' are constantly increasing; and then after the first moment s the quantity 1 .r (204.) will be constantly finite, positive, and decreasing, during the same interval, so that its integral must be greater than if it had constantly its final value; that is, fr tdr > (r-.q) Or .. . ..(205.) Hence, although Or tends to infinity, yet (r -q) Or tends to zero, when by diminishing the interval we make r tend to q; and. therefore the following difference M~~m~ ~0,dr ~ f(~O O (206. J/, Q2. dr M m; X, . (06 will also tend to 0, and so will also its partial differential coefficient of the first order, taken with respect to P. We find therefore the following formula for {,r, a}, (remembering that this combination has been shown to be independent of r,) {fT}W=I q{ fOrdr+ IM q Ba j q rdr' . * (207.) the sign A implying that the limit is to be taken to which the expression tends when r tends to q. In this last formula, as in (199.), the integralf Or d r may be considered as a known function of r, q, a, B, or simply of r, q, z, if pJ be eliminated by the first, condition (186.) ;, and since it vanishes independently of X when r q, it may be thus denoted: Oir d(r =Pq (rq q z)) (. q. z) *(208.) the form of the function p depending on the law of attraction or repulsion. This integral therefore, when considered as depending on X and D, by depending on z and q, need not be varied with respect to z, in calculating {a', c} by (207.), because PROFESSOR HAMILTON ON A GENERALL METHOD IN DYNAMICS. 139 its partial differential coefficient (xf Or dr), obtained by treating q as constant, vanishes at the limit r =; nor need it be varied with respect to q, because, by (186.), + M 2 = . . . ... . . . . . (209.) it may therefore be treated as constant, and we find at last { 5 A)1 2 05 = ()) w * e o e X * * * * * X * X o 4 * * * (210.) the two terms (199.) or (203.) both tending to infinity when r tends to q, but always destroying each other. 36. Collecting now our results, and presenting for greater clearness each combination under the two forms in which it occurs when the order of the elements is changed, we have, for each binary system, the following thirty expressions: {A, z} = ?, {,X .-1 {i, P} = 0, {v, } = O, z} = O, ) {841X = 0, {r, A} = 0, {7, I} = 1, {r, i = 0, {7, c} 0, 3 1, {IV ,} =XI 0{en p} = 0, {C 45 = 0 I>, 'I} = 0; {'r, J = ? {'r5 A}-4 {1A = -175pi {,r, i}0 { }_0 {I~~~~4 =}1 O.nA_07{, I}" =i O.{0 i 071 0; }= so that the three combinations {dt,7a} {ca),Z} {?a, V} are each equal to positive unity; the three inverse combinations {. {X9)} {v,X} are each equal to negative unity; and all the others vanish. The six differential equations of the first order, for the 6 varying elements of any one binary system (Ml M), are therefore, by (02.), dou 8H dc _ _ dx ! CHP 2 d H2 > dt a ; -r 8x)m dt=-8A >e me S dA aH2 -d a H2 dt = d ' 3 and, if we still omit the variation of t, they may all be summed up in this form for the variation of H2, H2 = w('r-'P + A8 -'l+A8va k (T2.) which single formula enables us to derive all the 6 n 6 differential equations of the first order, for all the varying elements of all the binary systems, from the variation or from the partial differential coefficients of a single quantity Hz, expressed as a function of those elements. T 2 140 PROFESSOR HAMILTON ON A GENERAL METHOD IN DYNAMICS. If we choose to introduce into the expression (T2.), for Z H2, the variation of the time t, we have only to change b 'r to B b 1, because, by (Q2.), B t enters only so accompanied; that is, t enters only under the form t ,i in the expressions of i pi fI' y'i ztj as functions of the time and of the elements we have, therefore, aH2 z 8 = E aH2 ,. m ; . . . . . . .. . . .

Zbeing any 6 n elements of a system expressed as functions of the time and of the quantities z a; or more concisely by this special consideration, that HI +112 is constant in the disturbed motion, and that in taking the first total differential coeflicient of 112 with respect to the time, the elements may by (F1.) be treated as constant. It is also a remarkable corollary of the general principles just referred to, but one not difficult to verify, that the first partial differential coefficient of any element X5> taken with respect to the time, may be expressed as a function of the elements alone, not involving the time explicitly. On the essential distinction between the Systems of Varying Elements considered in this Essay and those hitherto employed by mathematicians. 37. When we shall have integrated the differential equations of varying elements (S2.), we can then calculate the varying relative coordinates a w 4, for any binary system (m, M), by the rules of undisturbed motion, as expressed by the equations (12.), (Q2.). or by the following connected formulae: =r (cos?+ x sin(d-v)sinv) j = r (sin 0_ sin (0-v) cos ), (V2) 4 = x 2 x-2 sin (d-): (7 PROFESSOR HAMILTON ON A GENERAL METHOD IN DYNAMICS. 141 in which the distance r is determined as a function of the time t and of the elements 1' a, A, by the 5th equation (Q2.), and in which VM+m dr X ./{1 2 pi + 2 Mf (r) _M Ax } *(2 V~c~) AVI VM~m(W q being still the minimum of r, when the orbit is treated as constant, and being still connected with the elements z, A, by the first equation of condition (186.). In astronomical language, M is the sun, m a planet, M ; t are the heliocentric rectangular coordinates, r is the radius vector, 0 the longitude in the orbit, w the longitude of the perihelion, v of the node, 0 c is the true anomaly, 0 v the argument of latitude, pl the constant part of the half square of undisturbed heliocentric velocity, diminished in the ratio of the sun's mass (M) to the sum (M + m) of masses of sun and planet, x is the double of the areal velocity diminished in the same ratio, x is the versed sine of the inclination of the orbit, q the perihelion distance, and r the time of perihelion passage. The law of attraction or repulsion is here left undetermined; for NEWTON'S law, p. is the sun's mass divided by the axis major of the orbit taken negatively, and z is the square root of the semiparameter, multiplied by the sun's mass, and divided by the square root of the sum of the masses of sun and planet. But the varying ellipse or other orbit, which the foregoing formulae require, differs essentially (though little) from that hitherto employed by astronomers: because it gives correctly the heliocentric coordinates, but not the heliocentric components of velocity, without differentiating the elements in the calculation; and therefore does not touch, but cuts, (though under a very small angle,) the actual heliocentric orbit, described under the influence of all the disturbing forces. 38. For it results from the foregoing theory, that if we differentiate the expressions (V2.) for the heliocentric coordinates, without differentiating the elements, and then assign to those new varying elements their values as functions of the time, obtained from the equations (S2.), and deduce the centrobaric components of velocity by the formulae (12.), or by the following: I = t , M +r ml _ = M +(214.) M+m' Y -M~m' M-+mS ?v(1v then these centrobaric components will be the same functions of the time and of the new varying elements which might be otherwise deduced by elimination from the integrals (Q2.), and will represent rigorously (by the extension given in the theory to those last-mentioned integrals) the components of velocity of the disturbed planet m, relatively to the centre of gravity of the whole solar system. We chose, as more suitable to the general course of our method, that these centrobaric components of -velocity should be the auxiliary variables to be combined with the heliocentric coordinates, and to hanve their disturbed values rigorously expressed by the formulk 142 PROFESSOR HAMILTON ON A GENERAL METHOD IN DYNAMICS. of undisturbed motion; but in making this choice it became necessary to modify these latter formulae, and to determine a varying orbit essentially distinct in theory (though little differing in practice) from that conceived so beautifully by LAGRANGE. The orbit which he imagined was more simply connected with the heliocentric motion of a single planet, since it gave, for such heliocentric motion, the velocity as well as the position; the orbit which we have chosen is perhaps more closely combined with the conception of a multiple system, moving about its common centre of gravity, and influenced in every part by the actions of all the rest. Whichever orbit shall be hereafter adopted by astronomers, they will remember that both are equally fit to represent the celestial appearances, if the numeric elements of either set be suitably determined by observation, and the elements of the other set of orbits be deduced from these by calculation. Meantime mathematicians will judge, whether in sacrificing a part of the simplicity of that geometrical conception on which the theories of LAGRANGE and POISSON are founded, a simplicity of another kind has not been introduced, which was wanting in those admirable theories; by our having succeeded in expressing rigorously the differentials of all our own new varying elements through the coefficients of a single function: whereas it has seemed necessary hitherto to employ one function for the Earth disturbed by Venus, and another function for Venus disturbed by the Earth. Integration of the Simpljfied Equations, which determine the new varying Elements. 39. The simplified differential equations of varying elements, (S2.), are of the same form as the equations (A.), and may be integrated in a similar manner. If we put, for abridgement, (arz V)-g =f{ (Er jT2 + Z X2 +V -2) _H2} dt, 2 . (X2.) and interpret similarly the symbols (u, w, X), &C., we can easily assign the variations of the following 8 combinations, (er, a, v) (pi, c, X) (p, z, v) (ar, a, X) (Er, cv, V) (p, z, X) (, X) (p.n, c, v); namely, Z (,z>) = * m ((sf04pi0 (r + Xal X w 0-)0 + v PX vo ?O) H2 t,1 (PWvX)m (0 +'ro 'pir+ o W z+?o PoP) H2t,| Z (, A)= E 7m ( pi MB-0 T P0E + W0 o w X + Xko Po P) H2, (Y2) 3(E,z,X) = . m(pi Tor0 {,0 ? +Q w oz+ Po VX) tH2, (Ki Z5A) = (U,0 TO r-A pi + z W Z-X0 B SO + X0 Po 0-A X V) -H2 8to 3 . m (X {ra0 To(.0 +cz w zS + XAyvXV) H tJ (iw (4tp) =E*m(joro pbr+ vobzo wxz +Y~x-P vo ~o) 12~tt Zo X0 Po Vo To o0 being the initial values of the varying elements z X.. v Er w. If, then, we consider, for example, the first of these 8 combinations (T, z, A), as a function of PROFESSOR HAMILTON ON A GENERAL METHOD IDN DYNAMICS. 143 all the 3 n 3 elements'pi w xi, and of their initial values o, i woi ko) , involving also in general the time explicitly, we shall have the following forms for the 6 n -6 rigorous integrals of the 6 n 6 equations (S2.): a a mi Zi al O.) z ); was zo?

The determination of all the varying elements would therefore be fully accomplished, if we could find the complete expression for any one of these 8 combinations. 40. A first approximate expression for any one of them can be found from the form under which we have supposed IH2 to be put, namely, as a function of the elements and of the time, which may be thus denoted: H2 = t2 (5 Zs15 ;1 541 P15 V1 enD WD Z n-15 xn-15 Pn-15 Yn-Wr n-1) wn-I) (A3.) by changing in this function the varying elements to their initial values, and employing the following approximate integrals of the equations (S2.), = p? + m j:d sdt. = ro g :8Hd t,1 Pi P0 + .i0 TO mJ Po~ d1rr W = 0 + J: bH2 d t, z = -o ad0 . .

An approximate expression thus found may be corrected by a process of that kind, which has often been employed in this Essay for other similar purposes. For the function G, or the combination (ar, x, v), must satisfy rigorously, by (Y2.) (A3.), the following partial differential equation: 144 PROFESSOR HAMILTON ON A GENERAL METHOD IN DYNAMICS. a G ( 1G iaG IaG IlaG 119 t, cr ~-W -1(hl 24)-C-,0)-W O = 8G + H (am sln Infl ml I A1Ml F inm2 a C02'***nl and each of the other analogous functions or combinations (Y2.) must satisfy an analogous equation: if then we change G to G1 + G2, and neglect the squares and products of the coefficients of the small correction G2, G, being a first approximation such as that already found, we are conducted, as a second approximation, on principles already explained, to the following expression for this correction G2: G2 =a J t 8;G 2 ( t ml a WIn 3 15 Pi IM Al -1 ml 81'I1**)}( which may be continually and indefinitely improved by a repetition of the same process of correction. We may therefore, theoretically, consider the problem as solved; but it must remain for future consideration, and perhaps for actual trial, to determine which of all these various processes of successive and indefinite approximation, deduced in the present Essay and in the former, as corollaries of one general Method, and as consequences of one central Idea, is best adapted for numeric application, and for the mathematical study of phenomena.
