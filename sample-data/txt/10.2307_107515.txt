: 25 :i ll. On the developement of exponential functions; together wit/ several new theorems relating to finite dffferences. By John Frederick W. Herschel, Esq. F. R. S. Read December iA, 1815. N the year 1772, LAGRANGE, In a Memoir, published among those of the Berlin Academy, announced those celebrated theorems expressing the connection between simple exponeni tial indices and those of differentiation and integration. The demonstration of those theorems, although it escaped their illustrious discoverer, has been since accomplished by many analysts, and in a great variety of ways. LAPLACE set the first example in two Memoirs presented to the Academy of Sciences* and may be supposed in the course of these researches, to have caught the first hint of the Calcul des Fonctions Generatrices wvith which they are so intimately connected ; as, after an interval of two years, another demonstration of them, drawn solely from the principles of that calculus appeared, together with the calculus itself, in the memoirs of the Academy. This demonstration, involving, however, the passage from finite to infinite, is therefore (although preferable perhaps in a systematic arrangement, where all is made to flow from one fundamental principle) less elegant; not on account of any confusion of ideas, or want of evidence; but, because the ideas of finite and infinite, as such, are extraneous to symb ;l'llic language, and, if weM* Man. des Savans Etrangers, 773 p. 535.Mem. de 'Acad. 177Zp P, ',O1-MlDCCCXVI. E 26 Mr. HERSCHEL on the would avoid their use, much circumlocution, as well as very unwieldy formulae must be introduced. ARBOGAST also, in his work on derivations, has given two most ingenious demonstrations of them, and added greatly to their generality ; and lastly, Dr. BRINKLEY has made them the subject of a paper in the Transactions of this Society,* to which I shall have occasion again to refer. Considered as insulated truths, unconnected with any other considerable branch of analysis, the method employed by the latter author seems the most simple and elegant which could have been devised. It has however the great inconvenience of not making us acquainted with the bearings and dependencies of these important theorems, which, in this instance, as in many others, are far more valuable than the mere formula. The theorems above referred to are comprehended in the equation. AUXC -$ I Stn . . . ........ (a) or, more generally (f(1+A)uaf {sAxD}ux; * * . (b) where the A applies to the variation of x, and the D to the functional characteristic u; and where n may have any value whatever. Taking these theorems for granted, I shall observe, that, in their present form, they are but abridged expressions of their meaning, and that to become practically useful, their second members must be developed in a series of the powers of Ax.D. This part of their theory has been most beautifully and satisfactorily treated by LAPLACE in the case of n . i* Phil. Trans. 1807. It developement of exponentialfunctions, &c. 27 (one of the, most 'important). Unfortunately, his method turns upon an artifice which, although remarkably ingenious, fails to afford us any satisfaction except in this particular case; and I am not aware that his researches have since extended beyond it. The essay of Dr. BRINKLEY (the only author I have met with who has attempted the general problem) goes to the bottom of the difficulty, and leads to a formula which, considering the complex nature of the subject, must be allowed to be far rmore simple than could have been expected. It is often, however, advantageous to undertake the solution of the same problem by different methods. The excellent geometer I have mentioned, has adopted one which appears at first sight very inartificial. It consists in expanding the second member of the equation (a) reduced to the form {l + x.2.3.+ &C. by the well-known theorem for raising a multi-nomrnial to the nth power. The difficulties and apparent obstacles which this method presents, he has overcome or eluded by a sitigularly acute discussion of the combinations of the various numerical coefficients and their powers. But it is obvious that this method, applied to the more general equation (h), would lead into details of extreme complexity. This consideration induced me to begin with that equation, regarding the other as a particular case of it and I have thus arrived at a general and highly interesting formula (equation (2) of the following pages) hitherto, I believe, totally unnoticed, and which in thle particular case of the equation (a), when n is a positive integer, affords precisely the same result as Dr. BRINKLEY has given: when n, however, is negative, it yields an express E. _o 28 Mr. HERSCHEL on the sion widely differing from his in point of form (though of course affording the same numerical results) and which in the most important case, where 7a=-, take's a form of greater simplicity than any I am yet aware of. I purpose then to consider the second member of (b) as developed in a series of powers of A x. D (which for the ske of brevity we will denote by t). If then we suppose f ( -t)-Af+A't+A~t2 + &c. we shall have dxf (et) XI... . dtx where t=o after the differentiations.

We have then making t-o, dxf(l) Df(i) A. ,f J(X) AXOx If we separate the symbols of operation from those of quan. tity, the second member of this equation may be much more elegantly written as follows: {DA+ (DA)z + DA) X referring the D to the functional characteristicfs, and the A to the o and its powers. -Or, we may throw it into the following form, Dt(i) A + I D 2zf () A2 D xf ,*AX} OX Upon this, we have to observe-first, that the addition of the termf (1) at the beginning of the series within the brackets makes no difference in, the result ; adding only to it the term ( i) x o ', which vanishes of itself: and, in the next place, that we are at liberty to suppose the series continued to D xf(i) )~flnity; as every term beyond A, 0 vanishes, Owing 30 Mr. HERSCHEL On the to -the well-known property of the functions A X+1 o A 2o , &c., each of which is equal to zero u Our series then becomes {/( 1) + I ()a+ &c. } o =f ( 1+AJo and we have therefore f((e )=f(l )+ LOf ( 1+A)0+ l% 2 AgZ+)o+ &C. . .Am@ e In applying this series to any particular case we have only to developer (1 +A) in powers of A: then striking out the first term, as well as all those where the exponent of A is higher than that of t, to apply each of the remaining ones immediately before the annexed power of o, and the developement is then in a form adapted to numerical compUtation. This formula may be also farther compressed into f (e') = f ( '+A) 0; ' . *. * (3) by simply writing it as follows: f()=)f (1+A ){ 1+t.O+t?+ &C.}. I shall notice one more form in which the same 'result may be exhibited. If we continue the series (1 ), as before, to infinity, and add the term I at its commencement, it becomes { 1 +-Jr + &c!}oxf(I)= D ox f(i) whence, wve obtain (Et) = + xE o A (I1) + 0, * E(l) + &C. or, attending carefully to the application of the symbols f(et)=_AD {1 +o + + &c.} We? + no proe;d to a t esults to te actual We will nowa proceed to apply these results to the actual developement of exponential functions, &c. devrelopement of equation (a).

In the former, we have already in our equation (7) given the expression for 'B or B . Its alternate, even values (the X z signs alone excepted) are those numbers so wvell known in analysis by the name of the "s Numbers of BERNOUILLI," and anong the variety of expressions they admit, I know of none so compendious, or so readily computed arithmetically. Indeed, to compute the higher numbers of BERNOUILLI directly has always been attended with some labour. If we examine the values of B0, B , B , &c., we shall observe that all the odd ones (with the exception of B = ) vanish: as indeed may easily be shown a przori from the nature of the function t A considerable simplification of the latter case takes place owing to this cir numstance : the alternate values of 9B being MDcccxvV.

The computation of the functions 1S { 4 }n 'S I c. is attended with very little difficulty;for, if we multiply together successively the terms i + z, 2 + z, 2 + z, &C. and call developement of exponentizalnctions & the co-efficient of zx-P in the product PS (x) we shall have n+ I S(x) n_ r1 7 I.2.3 -. ,.. X and, as every value of '-' S {-r }, from x-n up to xoo is wanted, the principal part of the work consists in calculating the first n terms of the successive products, which, (being derived from one another) except n is considerable, is attended with very little trouble. The remarkable form of our equation (2) enables us to exhibit a variety of properties of the functions comprehended under the expression A, Ox, some of the principal of which I shall now proceed to notice. Supposef() =a a t + a. tt + &c. Then, as we have shown, f (' +A\)ot e**e@b?C3,*X** ( from which we find (I1 + A ) ox ? ai *.2 f* e a. JJ*Ooo* 0 aD (0 0 0 )0 ..... (14) If then the developemnent off (el) be given, we are enabled to assign the value off ( i + A)ox in function s of x, a nd the converse. It is scarcely necessary, however, to remark, that the extent of these equations is not limited to cases inr wlich the actual developement off (1 + A) in powers of A ispracticable, or in which the -form off is known, or even dependent on analytical relations. Let us suppose a function F(t), and any two othersf (t) and f' (t), so related that F (t) f (t) f' (t) Let also F (t) =AO + Al 1 t + A2 t + &c. o6 Mr. HERSCHEUL on the asimilar notation being used, for f() andf (t) changing only A into a and a'. It is evident then, that AX =-ad aX +a a 4 + ..* e *a -at In this equation, substituting for A. &c., their values drawn from (13), we find F( 1+ A)o f(i + A)o0f'((1 +A)ox+ Xf3(' + A)o + +~+ if + A)o2( J )OX_2 + c This equation may be abbreviated, upon the principles we have a11 along adopted, by a very simple and convenient artifice of notation, viz, by applying an accent to one of the A and also to the corresponding 0; these accents not altering the meaning of the symbals, but solely pointing out those which are to be applied to one another. The second number of this equation then becomes 3r(1+A~~~~o.J (+)t ,g1+A) J, (+ AI)O + 4&C. ;In which the symbols of operation may now, without confuMon. be separated from those of quantity, when it will take the form, .~~~~~ x (1 + A) Jf(l +,A)d ? + OX-' + &. And our equation becomes F ( +,a)ov =f (I1 +,A) .jt ( I +t) {0+0,};fee++? (1,5) We must here notice, that the second member of this equation is precisely what the first would become, if, instead of F(i+A) we had writtenf ( i + A) *1' ( i + a ), its equivalent, and instead of , the symbolic expression o 4So which is equal to it in quantity, and then applied the former A to the former o, and the latter to the latter, by the method of accentuation developement of exponefialjufucltions, &C. 37 above explained. Pursuing this idea, let us suppose F(t) to be decomposable into any number of factorsf(t),J(t),j" t0 , &c., and by executing the samne iiechanical process on the expression F (1 + A)ox, we, resolve it into f (+ A) Jf (a + Al). &C. {o + 0'+ o +&c. }. A moment's attention to the method by which (ki5) was ornginally derived, will convince us that (attending to the proper application of the symbols) we are at liberty to develope the expression to + o' + o" + &c. }, and thus we have the equation F( + e )oxtf( 1 + )fA'(1+A').&c. { 0ojo+&c. } i+ se( 16) SIoUild any on-e of the functions f ( 1 + A), &c., be of the form (i + Y) any term m-nultiplied by oi in the developement of o + o' 4+ &c. will acquire the coefficient (x + A), o, which, being, by ( 14), the coefficient of t in the developement of' (1 +4 1)Y, or akt, multiplied into 1.2.3. .7, is elva dentdy (-aoual to kF. Now it is the same thing whether we write kP for ( 1 + A )k o' after the developement, or at once strike out ( 1 + A ), and for o write k previously to it. Hence fee conclude that (I+z )kF('1+A)ox=f(t+A)j'( i+A').&c.{ k+o+o'+&c. } here, as before, F(t) =f(t) .of(t). &c.

It seems hardly necessary, after what has been said, to notice that the developement of any function, such as f {4 (t), ', f' (t) &c } in which t, I', &c. denote any number of independent variables, s '4, &c., any functional characteristics, and n, n', &c., any indices, may be accomplished by the same means-or, more conveniently, -derived from (33) in the same manner as the formula (27) was obtained from our equation (2); and the result included in a brief and simple expression. The cases however are few, where the results afforded appear, if I may so express it, in their natural form, and it would therefore be useless at present to extend our views farther in this direction.
