E 171 I IX. On the Cotparison of Hlyperbolic Arcs. By CHARLES W. MERRIFIELD. Communicated by the Rev. -Dr. BOOTH, F.BR.S Received March 3,-sRead March 31, 1859. AN application of JACOBI'S second theorem-the imaginary transformation-has led me to a formula which reduces the comparison of the arcs of hyperbolas to the same facility as that of elliptic arcs. The transformation is so easy and obvious, that I have had some hesitation in publishing it; but I observe that my result was not noticed by LEGENDRE, or by Professor MOSELEY, or in any more recent work which I have seen. Some of its applications, too, are worthy of remark. I shall use the ordinary notations: )(d, p)=(1sin2O sin2 ), F(d, p)=_ E(_ The functional equation Fp+FP2-.F30.(A.) is satisfied, as is well known, by either of the three trigonometrical equationsCos P3=COS P1COS P2-sin A sin P2 V(1-sin2d. sin2 3 . . . .

Dividing each of these by cos PI . cos p2. cCOS p3, and transposing, they become sec p3 =sec PI sec P2+tan Sp tan p2 v'(1+cos2O. tan2 P3) . . . .

It will be noticed, that we might pass from one set to the other, directly, by substituting sec p for cos'p, V/; tan p for sin p, and cos d for sin d. These substitutions constitute JACOBI'S second theorem. They convett dp into V 1it (1-sin2 0. s p)W (1-sin2 0 . sin2 2 p)' and (1-sin2 0. sin2 p) dp into V . d (1 -sin2 0. sin2 p)1. Now, calling 5(1 sin2 0sini2'p)tdp, EP, we know that E, + EP2 EP3sin2 sin A ,. sin 22 -sin P3. (7. 172 MR. C. W. MERRIFIELD ON THE COMPARISON OF HYPERBOLIC ARCS. If, therefore, we make the above substitutions in this equation, and divide by v i, we have, making Ho= (sin2 d sin2p) 2, Hl +Hp2-Hp3=COS2 O. tan p,. tan ;2* tan .I(8.) Moreover, since we also have Fj ++FP2-FP3= , it is evident that these equations remain true, if we put for Ep, Ep+k. FP or for HP, Hp+k.Fp, k being any constant whatever. If we make k= sin2 d, Up = ip S-n2 d. Fp represents the arc of a hyperbola. In fact, if Si Io =1 be the equation to a hyperbola, and we make the ordinate sin 0 y= cos2d. tan p, we have the abscissa x= V (1sin2d sin2p). From these we may obtain by differentiation, V(dX2 ty os820 dp ad& 2) =SCOS2 Vi sin2 0. sin2p) -r 1 -sin20 sin2 d sin2 0. dp Cos2p/ (I -sin2O.sin2p)> JV(1 sin2O.sin2p)' or Up = H -sin2 . Fp. If we make sin Br=sin 0. sin p, r is the angle which the normal of the hyperbola makes with the axis of x. If we change the variable from p to r, we have U =sin2 O. cos2 S-s d jj% (80 _ Sing )2 an equation which bears a remarkable analogy to the arc of the ellipse referred to its tangent, E1-E =cos2 f(1Sj I Sfl'7)E,-E= COS d r( _sine 0. sin9 T) S It may be worth while to remark, that d, the angle of the modulus, represents, in the ellipse, the eccentricity, while in the hyperbola it represents the angle between the asymptote and the ordinate. For the comparison of hyperbolic arcs, therefore, we have the equation UP1 + UP2 U3 -coS2 v.tanAl.tanP2.tanp3,. (9.) answering to the equation for elliptic arcs, Ep1+Ep2-Ep3=sind.sin p.sin p2 -sin p,.(7.) Formula (8.) may be derived from the equations (4.), (5.), (6.) in exactly the same way that formula (7.) is derived from the equations (1.), (2.), (3.)*.* For the details, see LEGENDRE, 'Fonctions Elliptiques,' vol. i. p. 43, or MOSELEY " On Definite IJtegrals," Eneyclopwedia Metropolitana, 'Pure Mathematics,' vol. ii. p. 497.

MERRIFIELD ON THE COMPARISON OF HYPERBOLIC ARCS. 173 In particular, if @3-1 we have, for the complementary functions, Up1+U U 2=, as it ought to be, since the whole length of the curve is infinite. For duplication, making p1=@2=w, we have UP32Uc (cos O. tan w)2 tan p3. The same formula serves for bisection, if we obtain w from it by the help of the elliptic equations. Equation (8.) is easily verified at the extremes, making 0=0, Hp= Cos =tan (p, and we have the known theorem tan ca+tan 3-tan (ov+I3)=-tan c.tan 13tan (M+(3).

(11.) which I should call the MERIDIONAL EQUATION, from its connexion with the common formula for meridional parts, and with certain curves on MERCATOR'S Chart, which I have discussed elsewhere. I have taken the trouble of deducing (8.) from (4.), (5.), (6.) directly, but the process is so exactly parallel to Mr. MOSELEY'S work, at vol. ii. p. 497 of the work above cited, that it would be unnecessary to insert it here. A simpler verification may be found as follows: differentiating with regard to p the expression tan p. Ap, we have d (tanAp)= P _sin2Osin" f Al2+AP_ I whence, by integration (no constant needed, since each term vanishes with I), tan p. Ap=Hp+Ep-Fp. (12.) If we now add the equations (7.) and (8.) and subtract the equation Fpj+F@2-FP3-01 we should have, substituting (12.), tan Al. A41+tan P2.

Equation (8.) leads to a formula for the direct reduction of the logarithmic integral of the third kind, whose parameter is negative and greater than unity. It is the exact analogue of LEGENDRE'S formula for the reduction of the same integral where the parameter is negative and less than unity, pp. 153, 154 of his third volume on Elliptic Functions. The reduction is of some importance, because on it depends the possibility of tabulating those functions, which would otherwise require a table of treble entry, too cumbrous to attempt.

MERRIFIELD ON THE COMPARISON OF HYPERBOLIC ARCS. 175 One lesson we may learn from this process is, that the proper expression for the negative parameter greater than unity is -(1 + cos2 0 tan2 a). In geometrical researches this remark will probably lead to simplicity. LEGENDRE has deliberately avoided the discussion of this form of the parameter*. His reason was, that the complete integral presents itself in the form of so--x. The tabulation of the function V>, would only require a table of double entry. It may be as well to notice that the equations (a.), (b.), (c.) are solved by auxiliary arcs as follows: Assume tan as= tan pAvc, tan ;1= tan atAp, then i2=872 + 481. It is needless to remark that JACOBI'S transformation does not enable us to reduce the integral of the circular form. The difficulty which we here encounter, is exactly analogous to that which presents itself in the reduction of the cubic equation of ordinary algebra. In fact, if we were to apply JACOBI'S transformation to one only of cc or (p, the auxiliary arcs just mentioned would give values of w of the form 4?4'V / , and the difficulty would depend upon the interpretation of F(4?
