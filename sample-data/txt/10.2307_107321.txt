1 3to J XV. Of the Penetration of a Hemisphere by an indefinite Nu2tlber of equal and similar Cylinders. By Thonmas Knight, Esq. Communicated by Sir Humphry Davy, LL. D. Sec. R. S. Read March 19, i182. T HE well known theorems of VIVIANI and BossUT, respect-a 0~~~~~~~ b U fing certain portions of the surface and solidity of a hemisphere, form, together, a single case of the following problem; which is one of the most remarkable, for generality and simplicity of result, in the whole compass of geometry.Problem. To pierce a hemisphere, pertpendicularly on the plane of its base, with any number of equal and similar cylinders; of such a kind, that, ff we take awayfrom ihe hemisphere those portions of the cylinders that are within it, the remaining part shall admit of an exact cubature: and ~f we take away, from the surface of the hemisphere, those portions cut out by the cylinders, the remaining surface shall admit of an exact quadrature. Let fig. 1 represent the nearest half of the hemisphere, where a is the pole, bdcf a quadrant of the great circle formM1r'. KNIGHTon lthe PenetratiQon, &C. ing its base. From every point d, on this side of b, draw the radius dC to the centre of the hemisplere, and (if the number of cylinders is to be 2n*) take the arc bs equal to n times the arc bd, draw se perpendicular to Cb, and with the centre C and radius Ce describe the arc er cutting Cd in r. Through all the points (r) thus found, draw the curve line brC, terminated at b and C, and it shall be half the base of one of the required cylinders. It is, in the first place, evident, from the construction, that the half cylinder, whose base is beCrb, is contained between two planes CabC, CacC, making with each other the angle bCc =9?; consequently the whole base of the hemisphere may be pierced by asn such cylinders as this is the half of. Let atmb be the intersection of the surfaces of the half cylinder and hemisphere; amd a great circle passing through a and d, and meeting atmb at m. Call the radius of the sphere r, Cr is the cosine of the arc bs to the radius r, by construction; it is also the cosine of the arc md to the same radius; therefore mnd = bs n x bd. Put bd = p; md n x p; dx 4'. Moreover, put A for the spherical space atmbdcna contained by the arcs anc, cdb and the curve atmb; and let S be the solidity of the portion of the hemnisphAiiere contained between the quadrant ancC and the surface (brCatalb) of the half cylinder. It is easy to see that A=-2jffp cos. 4 4', S = JfcI cos. 4 X Cos. 4 X cos. 4 4 t iff/p cos. np x cos. nT x cos. 4 . * I do not intend zn to represent an even number only, n may be -3, or A, or 5, &c. and 2fl express ainy number whatever.

Thus A and S (for the whole hemisphere) do not depend on the number of the cylinders with which the penetration is made; a most remarkable circumstance, seeing that amongst the bases of those cylinders are curves of an inainity of diferent kinds and orders. Let fig. 2 represent half the base of one of the cylinders;.t bP b IX4 rCb the radius of the hemisphere, C the centre. From r, any point in the curve, let fall the perpendicular rpon the axis; call Cp, x; rp, y. By construction, Cr Vx2 +j = r cos. n . bCr ; now the cosine of the simple arc bCr is v which being put in the trigonometrical expression for the cosine of the multiple arc of a Hemisphere, &L, S13 in terms of the cosine of the simple one, we have, for the equation of the curve brC. When n= _1, V+y2 _, -, or x y' = rx, the equation of a circle. When n -= az, Vx 7 + Y = Xk, _ror (x2t ")3 , (X*-y )'; and in general the curve will be algebraic when it is any whole number.
