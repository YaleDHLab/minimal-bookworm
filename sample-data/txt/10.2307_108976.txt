255 ] XII. On the Orders and Genera of Ternary Quadratic Forms. By HENRY J. STEPHEN SMITH, M.A., .R.S.,Savilian Professor of Geometry in the University of Oxord. Received February 21,-Read February 27, 1867. EISENSTEIN, in a Memoir entitled "Neue Theoreme der hdheren Arithmetik" , has defined the ordinal and generic characters of ternary quadratic forms of an uneven determinant; and, in the case of definite forms, has assigned the weight of any given order or genus. But he has not considered forms of an even determinant, neither has he givenf any demonstrations of his results. To supply these omissions, and so far to complete the work of EISENSTEIN, is the object of the present memoir. Art. 2. We represent byf the ternary quadratic form ax2+ ay2 + z2+2byz+ 2b'xz+2b"xy;.(1) we suppose that f is primitive (i. e. that the six integral numbers a, a', a", b, b1, 6" admit of no common divisor other than unity), and that its discriminant is different from zero; this discriminant, or the determinant of the matrix a, b", b' b6, a', b . (2) 1"6' b, a"t we represent by D; by ? we denote the greatest common divisor of the minor determinants of the matrix (2); by f2F the contravariant off, or the form (a'a"-b2)x2+ (a"aY2)f+ (aa'-b"2)z2 (3) +2(b'b"-ab)yz+2(bb-a'b')zx+2(bb'a"b")xy; J we shall term F the primitive contravariant off, and we shall write F=Ax2 +A'y2 + A"z2 +2Byz+2B'xz+22B"xy.(4) If I Q i\ is an integral number, and the discriminant, contravariant, and primitive contravariant of F are respectively gA2, Af, and f. The numbers 2 and A are arithmetical invariants of f; i. e. they remain unaltered when f is transformed by any substitution of which the determinant is unity and the coefficients integral numbers. We shall accordingly describe the primitive form f, and the class of forms containingf, as a form, and class, of the invariants [Q, A]. Similarly, F is a form of the invariants [A, 2], and the class containing F is a class of those invariants. The relation between the forms f and F is reciprocal; and this reciprocity extends throughout -the whole* CRELLE'S Journal, vol. xxxv. p. 117.MDCCCLXVII. 2 N 256 PROFESSOR H. J. S. SMITH ON THE ORDERS theory, the contravariants f and F, and the invariants 2 and A, being everywhere simultaneously interchangeable. Of definite forms we shall consider only those which are positive; and in the case of such forms we shall suppose Q. as well as A, to be positive, in order that F as well as f may be positive. In the case of indefinite forms we shall always attribute opposite signs to Q2 and A; so that in this case the discriminants of f and F will be of opposite signs. Thus the definiteness, or indefiniteness, of a form is indicated by the signs of its invariants; if, for example, p and q are positive numbers, the forms XI2+py2+pqz2 2-py2-pqz2 -X +py2 +_pgz2 are respectively of the invariants [p, I], [-qp, ], [p, -q]; and their primitive contravariants, px2+y2 +Z2, . pqx2+_y2 +z2, p X2-qy2_z2 are respectively of the invariants [q, p], [q, --PI p aq, P]I Art. 3. A primitive form f is properly primitive when one at least of its three principal coefficients a, a', a" is uneven; it is improperly primitive when those coefficients are all even. In an improperly primitive form, one at least of the three coefficients b, 6', 6" is uneven (or the form would not be primitive); if, therefore, f is improperly primitive, ?l is uneven and F properly primitive; and, reciprocally, if F is improperly primitive, A is uneven andf properly primitive. Again, the discriminant of an improperly primitive form is always even. Whenever, therefore, ?1 and A are both even, or both uneven, neither f nor F is improperly primitive. Primitive forms of the same invariants [Q2, A] are said to belong to the same order when they and their primitive contravariants are alike properly or alike improperly primitive. An order of properly primitive forms of the invariants [(2, A] always exists, for the form x2+ Q2y2 + f2Az2 is a form of that order. And we shall show hereafter that, when 2 is uneven and A even, there is always an improperly primitive order of forms of the invariants [Q2, A], in which jis improperly and F properly, primitive exceptwhen (2 is an uneven square, and -A an even or uneven square. And, reciprocally, when A is uneven and Q even, there is always an improperly primitive order of forms of the invariants [Q, A], in which f is properly and F improperly primitive, except when A is an uneven square, and -M an even or uneven square. These exceptions cannot occur if the forms are indefinite. For example, there are two orders of forms of the invariants [1, 12]. The properly primitive order contains three classes, represented by the forms t1, X, 120 1, 3, 40 t2 3, 30 0? 0 ?0 1 ? O. o0 0 1, } The improperly primitive order, in which the forms are improperly primitive, but their contravariants properly primitive, contains two classes, represented by the forms 2, 2, 4 2 2, 4 AND GENERA OF TERNARY QUADRATIC FORMS. 257 Art. 4.

If w represent any uneven prime dividing Q2. z any uneven prime dividing A, these equations imply the theoremsI. 'The numbers, prime to a, which are represented byf, are either all quadratic residues of x, or all non-quadratic residues of ac." In the first case we attribute to f the particilar generic character () = + 1, in the second we attribute tof the particular generic character (V) -1. II. "The numbers, prime to I, which are represented by F, are either all quadratic residues of 8, or all non-quadratic residues of a." We attribute to F the particular generic character (-) = +1 in the first case, (a') -1 in the second. If ? and A are both divisible by any uneven primef and F will both have particular characters with respect to that prime. These theorems are due to EISENSTEIN. Besides its particular characters with respect to uneven primes dividing QUf, if properly primitive, will have in certain cases particular characters (which we shall call supplemnentary) with respect to 4 and 8. If the uneven numbers represented byf are all f -I 1, mod 4, we attribute to f the particular character (1) 2 +1; if they are all *~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 2-1-3, mod 4, we attribute to of the particular character (1)2 -1. If they are all either 1, or 7, mod 8, we attribute to f the particular character (-1) 8 +1; if they are all either 3, or -5, mod 8, we attribute to f the particular character f2_1 (-1) 8 1. Lastly, if they are all either 1 or = 3, mod 8, f has the character f-ilf2-i (-1) 2 k 8 = +1; if they are all either 5, or 7, mod 8, it has the character f-I f2-1 2+ 8 =-1. Similarly, if F is properly primitive, it will, in certain cases, F-1 F2-1 acquire the characters (--1)2 =+1, or =-1; (-1) 8 + 1, or = 1; F-1 F2-1 (-)72 8 =+I, or=-I The following Table is useful for ascertaining the supplementary characters of any proposed form. 2NX2 258 PROFESSOR II.

Similarly, the obelisk prefixed to a character off or F-1 Q-I F indicates that that character is attributable to for Fonly when ( 1) 2 2 f-I A-1 in the first case, and( -1) 21 1) 2 in the second. The use of the Table is most easily explained by an example. Let the proposed form be f=2X2 2+7y2+ 7z22 2iz; its invariants are [2, 24], and its primitive contravariant is F=24x2+ 7zt+7z2+2yz. F-1 Since Q-2, mod 4 A-O mod 8, F has the supplementary characters (-1) 2and F2-1 (A) 81; the values of these characters are found by an inspection of the coefficients, F-1 D'-1 and are -1 and +1 respectively. Again, since Q'=1, l 2 ; the f2-i character (-1) 8 is therefore attributable to f, and an inspection of its coefficients f2ishows that (-1) 8 = +1. The demonstration of the assertions implied in the Table (so far as they relate to supplementary characters) is obtained without difficulty from the equations (5) and (6). It will suffice to consider one case as an example of the rest. Let f and F be both properly primitive, and let Q22Q' 2, mod 4; A-~O. mod S. If Ml=F(xl, y,, zl), M2=F(x2, y2, Z2) are two uneven numbers represented by F, we infer from equation (6) that 1 (xi ) is an uneven number, and consequently that Ml X M2-1, mod 8; M1 and M2 are therefore congruous to one another, mod 8; i. e. all uneven F-1 numbers represented by F are congruous, mod 8, or F has the characters (-1) 2, and F2-1 (-1) 8 . To prove that f has the supplementary character attributed to it in the Table, we observe first of all that F cannot represent unevenly even numbers; for, if possible, let F(x1, yl, zl) be unevenly even, and let F(x2, y2, Z2) be any uneven number represented by F; then in the equation (6) we have a square congruous, mod 8, to an unevenly even number, which is impossible. Now let Ml =fA(x, yl, Z,), n2=f(X2, Y2) z2) be any two uneven numbers represented by f; the number 2 dsf df). uneven in equation (5); and considering that equation as a congruence for the moKY-i F-1 dulus 8, we find XM251, or inXrn2-1+2X(-l) 2 + according as F(y1z2-&y2Zl, Z1X2-Z2ZX1, X1&Y2-XeY) is evenly even, or uneven. If, then, (-1) 2 =(-1 _ x)m2 is M1 or= 3, mod 8; i. e. the uneven numbers represented byf are either all of one or other of the linear forms 8k+1, 8k+3, or else all of one or other of the linear forms 8k+5, 8k+7; so f-i f2-i F-1 ___I that f has the supplemenhary character (-1) 2 X 8, But if (..1) 2 -(-1) 2 260 PROFESSOR H. J. S. SMITH ON TiE ORDERS MnI X m2 +1, or -1, mod 8, and the uneven numbers represented byf are either all of the linear forms 8k? I1, or else all of the linear forms 8k? 3, so that f has the f2-1 character (I-t)8 ,f-1 F2_1 ,f2-1 F2-i The signification of the symbols d, (-, 8 )P, ( 1) 8, (-1) 8 8 NY, which occur in the Table, is explained in Arts. 6 and 7. In the next article we shall establish an auxiliary proposition which is frequently useful. Art. 5. "1 There exist pairs of forms p and (P, equivalent to f and F, and satisfying the congruences p a2+2Qy2+r-QAZ2, IPr2AX2+7yAZ2+Mcz2 . (7) for any proposed modulus V; but this modulus must be uneven, if either f or F is improperly primitive." In the proof of this proposition we shall employ two lemmas of a very elementary character. (i) A properly primitive form f represents numbers prime to any given number V; and an improperly primitive form f represents the doubles of numbers prime to any given number V. Let p be any prime divisor of V, and iff is improperly primitive, let p be an uneven prime. If one of the numbers a, a', a" is prime to p, let a be prime to p; then if x is prime to p and y and z are divisible by p, f will acquire a value prime top. If a, a', a" are all divisible by p, one of the three numbers b, ii, 6Y must be prime to p; let b be prime to p; then if x is divisible by p, and y and z are prime to p, f will acquire a value prime to p. Iff is improperly primitive andp=2, we may consider I f 'instead off and I2a, 1-ai, la' instead of a, a', a"; and we may prove in the same way that l-f represents uneven numbers, Thus, among the p' systems of values which can be attributed to x, y, z for the modulus p, there are always some which renderf (or l f) prime to p; there are, therefore, among the V3 systems of values which can be attributed to x, z for the modulus V, some which render f (or l1f) simultaneously prime to every prime dividing V. (ii) If QiA is uneven, f represents numbers of both the linear forms 4k + 1 and 4k+ 3. One at least of the principal coefficients of if is uneven, because its discriminant is uneven: let then a be uneven, and let a'd-X, mod 2, a"l-, mod 2; the substitution x=x+xy+ Pz will transformf into a form fl, in which a,, a',, a,' are all uneven, and in which, because the discriminant is uneven, either only one, or else all three, of the coefficients bl, 6',, 6', are even. The four numbers a,, a', a',', a,+a',+ad+2b,+2#, +2b6 are then all uneven; they are all represented by f1, that is by f; but they are not all congruous to one another for the modulus 4; thereforef represents numbers of both the linear forms 4k+1 and 4k+3. It follows from these lemmas (i) that iff is an improperly primitive form, we can find AND GENERA OF TERNARY QUADRATIC FORMS. 261 a form equivalent to f, and having one of its principal coefficients unevenly even and prime to any uneven number; (ii) that if f is properly primitive, we can find a form equivalent to af, and having one of its principal coefficients prime to any given number; (iii) that if DA is uneven, we may suppose this principal coefficient of either of the two linear forms 4k+1, or 4k+3, at our option. We shall first suppose that the formsf and F, which it is proposed to transform into forms p and (F satisfying the congruences (7), are properly primitive. Let V'=Vi22A, and let us assume that in the form F, A" is prime to V', and also that A"=-Q mod. 4, if 2A is uneven. Let I mod V'; the redundant system of congruences ax+b"y+b'-O ] b"x+a'y+b -O mod V',, 6'x+by +a"l --Q ,i is resoluble, admitting Q incongruous solutions*. Let mod V', be any one of these solutions, and let us transformf by the substitution x~x+%z =Y +(AZ,1 into an equivalent form f. The coefficients a,, b", ad are the same as a, b", a'; the coefficients a", bil V, are respectively congruous for the modulus V' to y12Z, 0, 0; so that satisfies the congruence fiax 2+ 2b"xy +a'y2+yr2Az2, mod V'. The binary form (a, 6", a') is primitive; for if d is a prime dividing a, 6", a', it divides A", the determinant of (a, 6", a'), and U2A, the discriminant off; it therefore divides Q (because A" and A are relatively prime), and is a common divisor of the coefficients of the primitive form f, i. e. d= 1. Again, (a, 6", a') is not improperly primitive; if 12A is even, this is manifest, for f1 is not improperly primitive; if QiA is uneven, DA" is by hypothesis of the form 4k+ 1, and there are no improperly primitive binary forms of the determinant UA. We may now suppose that, in the properly primitive binary form A"l (a, 6", a'), a is uneven and prime to V'; let (3a a mod V'; then the congruences a x+6" OV 1 odV V"x+a' !32, are resoluble and admit of one solution. Let x = X, mod V', be that solution; if f, be transformed by the substitution x=x+,y, the resulting form p will satisfy the congruence aX2 +s y2+ryQ?Az2, mod V' and the forms 4 and 4) will satisfy the congruences (7) for the modulus V.* Philosophical Transactions, vol. cli. p. 323. 262 PROFESSOR H. J. S. SMITH ON THE ORDERS Attributing to VI the value VE2'2A', we may apply the same demonstration to the case in which eitherf or F is improperly primitive, the modulus V being supposed uneven. Art. 6. When neitherf nor F is improperly primitive, and neither i nor A evenly even, fand F, considered separately, have no particular characters, properly so called, with respect to 4 or 8. But, considered jointly, they have a certain character with respect to 4 or 8, which we shall term their simnltaneous generic character, and which it is important to consider here. If m=-f(x, y, z), M=F(X, Y, Z), the representations of m byf and of M by F are said to be simultaneous when x, y, z, X, Y, Z satisfy the equation xX+yY+zZ=O. (8) This definition of simultaneous representation suffices for our immediate purpose; we add, however, that if the two representations are primitive * as well as simultaneous, the equations XI, y, Z X , r,. -X,Y,Z.. . I (9) x, y, z x, X', z' -x=y' . . . . . . . (10) are resoluble in integral numbers x', y', z', X', Y', Z'. For, considering the first of these equations, we observe that [x, y, z] is a given solution, in relatively prime numbers, of the equation (8); let [x', y', z'] be a solution of the same equation which with [x, y, z] forms a fundamental set; the equation (9) is then satisfied by virtue of the characteristic property of the fundamental set (Philosophical Transactions, vol. cli. p. 297). Thus if the representations of m byf, and of M by F, are primitive and simultaneous, m is primitively represented by a binary form of determinant QM, which is itself primitively represented by ft; and, reciprocally, M is primitively represented by a binary form of determinantAm, which is itself primitively represented by F. In the four cases in which neither i2 nor A is evenly even, the simultaneous character off and F is given in the Table of Art. 4. The symbol T in that Table represents Af+L I T2aF+ A1m? I +1 A2'ML 1 the unit (1) 2 2 i e. the unit (_1) 2 ' 2 l2' and A' denoting the same numbers as in Art. 4, and m, M being any two uneven numbers simultaneously represented by f and F. Thus, if 2 A1, mod 2, the simultaneous character 4Jr is attributed in the Table to f and F; i. e. the uneven numbers simultaneously represented byf and F either all satisfy the equation T1, or else all satisfy the equation tP=-1. To demonstrate these simultaneous characters we consider the four cases separately, and for the formsf and F we substitute forms p and d) equivalent to them, and satisfying * The representation of a number by a form is said to be primitive when the values of the indeterminates do not admit of any common divisor besides unity. t See Art. 10. AND 0ENERA OF TERNARY QUADRATIC FORMS. 263 certain congruences for the modulus 4 or 8. The existence of the equivalent forms thus assumed results, in each case, from the theorem of the last article. Case (i) Let 2 -A =1 and let p and 4 satisfy the congruences At ~xax2 +Ipy2 + yz2, pb-3yX2+as43Y2+o43Z21mod 4. or Qua e aX' + f3Y' + rZ2, Attributing in succession to the indeterminates X, Y, Z all systems of values, mod 2, which satisfy the congruence xX+.yY+zZ-0, mod 2, and which render m and M simultaneously uneven, we find that in every case Am is congruous, for the modulus 4, to one of the numbers Oa, A, y, and f2M to one of the remaining two. Thus Am X 2IM+ I is necessarily congruous, for the modulus 2, to 2 X 2 one of the three numbers 4 , 4 4 But these numbers are all congruous to one another for the modulus 2, because the congruence 3r --=1, mod 4, implies the congruence +/3+ry+l=O, mod 4. Therefore the unit ft has always the same value for every pair of uneven numbers simultaneously represented by f and F. It will be seen that 4=-1, or '=+1, according as the congruences M-jB--y 1, mod 4, are or are not satisfied. Case (ii) Let Qi2 2, mod 4, Ai\1, mod 2, and let ,A ax2+2I3sy2+2yz2, mod 8, Qi'kl-2izX2+t3Y2+rZ2, mod 4, a43ry =1, mod 4. The admissible combinations of the values of x, y, z, X, Y, Z, mod 2, give rise to eight cases, Am a, mod 8; 2'M 3, or y, mod 4,. Am a o+2i2, mod 8; f'M2--j', or +,y mod 4, ME=-a + 2,y mod 8; 2'MA, or -re mod4, Am-a+2(3+2r, mod 8; Q'M -j3, or mod 4, A;?m2-1 and, in all of them, the value of the unit (8 T4, and therefore of the unit -f2(-1[W 4' is i the same, because, by virtue of the congruence a+0+r+l= 0, mod 4, MDccCLXVII. 2 o 264 PROFESSOR H.

Case (iii) Q 1, mod 2, A_= 2, mod 4. In this case the simultaneous character of the formsf and F may be demonstrated as in case (ii), or may be inferred by recipro6 cation from the result in that case. Case (iv) 2=-= 2, mod 4.

Art. 7. The following observations will serve to show more clearly the import of the simultaneous character in each of the four cases. Case (i) Let T= -1; then, 4if m and M are any two uneven numbers simultaneously represented by f and F, m A, mod 4, and M --Q., mod 4. Also Jf cannot represent numbers congruous to 74, mod 8, nor F numbers congruous to 72, mod 8; for the congruences (j? )(y+1I) _ (y+)(c-+l) _ (c?1)Q+1) ~1, mod 2, 4 4 .4 imply that a rty1, mod 4; i. e. that A, or, which is the same thing, f can only represent uneven numbers congruous to A, 3A, 5A. And similarly of uneven numbers F can only represent those which are congruous to g, 32, 52. Numbers congruous to 3A are represented byf, and numbers congruous to 32 are represented by F; but these representations are not simultaneous with the representation of any uneven number by F in the first-case, and byf in the second. AND GENERA OF TERNARY QUADRATIC FORMS. 265 Let T=+1; then if m and MI are uneven numbers simultaneously represented by f and F, one at least of the two congruences m= A, mod 4, M --2, mod 4, must be satisfied. Subject to this restriction, m and M may have any of the four linear forms 8k+1, 3, 5, 7.

The complete generic character of a form or class is the complex of all the particular characters attributable to the form or class, and to its primitive contravariant, including their simultaneous character, if any. And two forms, or classes, which have the same complete generic character are said to belong to the same genus. But not every complete generic character that can be assigned a priori, is the character of any really existing genus of forms. The annexed Table will serve, in the case of any given order, to distinguish those complete generic characters, which are possible, i. e. to which actually existing genera correspond, from those which are impossible. In this Table ?22 and A' are the greatest squares dividing fl and A; the quotients ?-2 . , A . A' are respectively represented, if uneven, by Q, and A1, if even by 2Q2 and 2A1, so that2 land A, are always uneven and not divisible by any square; wV and X are any primes dividing Q, and A,, co and 42 are any uneven primes dividing Q and A2, but 2 must not divide fg nor must Us divide AI; lastly, P is still the unit (-_1) 2 2 0IF+1 A1F+I or, which is the same thing, the unit (-I) 2 2 7f and F in the exponents of these units denoting uneven numbers simultaneously represented by the forrnsf and F. The Table A of properly primitive generic characters contains twenty-five compartments corresponding to the twenty-five cases indicated in its margin; the Tables B and C of improperly primitive genera contain three such compartments each.

The demonstration of this important theorem will occupy the next articles; it is, however, requisite to show in the first place that the enumeration of the supplementary characters in Table II. is in accordance with the Table 1. of Art. 4. For the Tables B and C this is evident; in Table A it is necessary to attend to the signification of the symbol A, which serves to represent the simultaneous character of f and F (as has been already explained f-I in Arts. 6 and 7) in those cases (marked S in the Table) in which neither (-1) 2 nor F-i (1)~ is a character, but which also appears in every compartment of the Table without exception. ,f-i F-1 (1) When (-1) 2 and (-1) 2 are both characters (cases P in the Table), "P is not an independent character, because its value is determined by the values of (1) 2 and F-1 (1) 2. It is retained in the Table only because it serves to express the criterion of possibility. f-i F-1 (2) When (-1) and 4, but not (-1) )2, are incribed as characters, T represents F-1 f-in Al-r the character (-1) -2, if (-1) _(-1) 2, and is simply +1 (i. e. not a character if-i A1-i at all), if (-1) . -(-1) 2. This is in accordance with Table I., according to F-i which, in the cases under consideration, (1)2 is or is not a character, according as f-I A,-I A,-I F-1 f-i (t-1y 2 =(1jr2, or =-(-1I) . Similarly, if (-1) and A, but not (-1)-, f-i are inscribed as characters, T represents the character (-1) 2 , or is not a character at F-1 al-i ni-I all, according as (1)=(-1)2 ) or = -(-1) 2 ; which again agrees with Table I. In these cases, marked Q in the Table, the symbol T supersedes the asterisks and obelisks of Table 1., and also serves to express the criterion of possibility. f-i F2-1 F-i (3) When (-1) 2 and (1) 8 x 4, but not (-1) 2, are characters in the Table, FF2-1 F-i F2-1 F2_1 (-1) 8 XI' represents the character (.1) 28 or (-1) ,8 according as f-i A,-I A,-I F-i f2-I (-J) 2 =(1 2 , or -(-1)2. And again, when (1) 2 and ( 1) 8sX 1', but not -2 are characters in the Table, (-1) x ' represents the character (-1) 2+, f2_F-1 n -i or (-1f according as (1)=(-1y-7 or 2 The result in these cases (marked R in the Table) is again in accordance with Table I.; and the use of the symbol T' is the same as in the cases Q. f2_1 eThus the units 4' ( l)'8 , X ( 1) F XI which properly represent simultaneous characters of the formsf and F, are employed, in the cases Q and R of the Table, to represent supplementary characters. This use of these symbolk is admissible, because, when iA is even (as it is in the cases Q and R), every representation of an uneven number byf or F is simultaneous with the representation of uneven numbers by F orf. 268PROFESSOR HI. J. S. SMITH ON THE ORDERS In the lower right-hand corner of each compartment in the Table, the number of possible genera contained in the order to which the compartment refers is represented by F; ry is the number of uneven primes dividing Q, together with the number of uneven primes dividing A, so that if the same prime divide both 2 and' A, it is to be counted twice. But it is to be observed that, when 2 and A are both perfect squares: (a case which can only arise when the forms' are definite), the number of possible genera is two-thirds of the number stated in the Table in the cases (Q), and one half in the cases (P). And again (as has been already stated in Art. 3), in Table B, when ? is aan uneven square, and A the double of 'a square, there are no possible genera; and when A is an uneven square, and 2 the double of an uneven square, there are none in Table C. Art. 9. It results from the theorem of Art. 5 that if f and F are properly primitive, they simultaneously and primitively represent uneven numbers prime to 52A. We may therefore suppose that inf and F, a and A" are uneven and prime to QA; we may also' suppose that these numbers are prime to one another, because A" being prime to 52A, and a being uneven, the binary form (a, I", a') is properly primitive (Art. 5), and so represents numbers prime to its determinant. Lastly, we may assume that a and A" are positive. If the forms f and F are definite, a and A" are certainly positive; if they are indefinite, A and 2 are of opposite signs; supposing, for example, that A is positive and Q2 negative, let m be any positive number primitively represented by f, and M any number simultaneously and primitively represented by F, then M is positive as well as mn; otherwise mMf, which is of the type MX2+QY2+miAZ2, would be a definite form. Positive numbers are therefore simultaneously and primitively represented byf and F; i. e. we may suppose a and A" simultaneously positive. The complete generic character off is then determined by the characters of a and A".

Again, iff is improperly and F properly primitive, let A" be prime to 22A; then the binary form (a, 6", a') is primitive, because A" is prime to A12, and improperly primitive, because f is improperly primitive. We may therefore suppose that la is uneven and prime to OA", and, as before, that a and A" are positive. Multiplying together the equations ('aj .)X )(A" =1 and transforming the result by the law of reciprocity, we find ) ) .2 2 i. e. the condition (12) is satisfied by the generic character off The case in whichf is properly and F improperly primitive, is the reciprocal of' the preceding. To show 'that the conditions (11), (12), (13) are sufficient as well as necessary, other principles are required. These principles relate to the representation of binary by ternary quadratic forms, and will be found in the 'Disquisitiones Arithmeticue,' arts. 282-284; it will, however, be convenient briefly to restate them here, in a form 'suited for our present purpose. Art. 10. A binary quadratic form (p, q"',p!) or p is said to be represented by a ternary form f whenf is transformed into p by a substitution of the type a'=oa,+ j31y, & 0'~2X + f02?/ Z=LZ3X+P3Z/. The representation is said to be primitive when the determinants of the matrix are relatively prime. If p is primitively represented byf, f is equivalent to orm containing X' as a part, i. e. to a form f' of the type f' = px2+p'y2+pltz2+2qyz + 22'xz+ 22txY, 270 -PROFESSOR H. J. S.

(17) the coefficients of x2, 2xy1 Y2 in the left-hand member being all divisible by P". If therefore p is a binary quadratic form of determinant -P",' admitting of primitive representation by a ternary form of order [E, A], -By is a quadratic residue of P". And we shall now show that if p is a primitive (and not negative) binary form of determinant Q2P", P' being of' the same sign as. A and prime to A, p admits of primitive representation by ternary forms of the invariants [Q, A], whenever -A 'is a quadratic residue of P". Because -Ap is a quadratic residue of P", the congruence (17) admits of solution in integral numbers Q, Q'. Any solution of this congruence supplies a system of five numbers, P, P', Q, Q', Q", satisfying the equations (16). The greatest common divisor of these five numbers divides A, because p, t, pI' are relatively prime; but P" is prime to A; therefore the six numbers P, P', F", Q, Q', Q" are relatively prime. Let q and I' be determined by the equations _9=a 2Q', , , , . * **** ~.(18) gr_"_ Q f which are always resoluble because their determinant q"'-pp'=i2P" is different from zero., Also let p" be determined by the equation q'Q' +qgQ i-"P" = QA ; * > . . . . * .

Again, in the reciprocal matrices (20) and (21), we must have [p'][ p"'] [q]2= Ap, [q][q'] [p"][Eq ItI-Ay -p"/ [21 = Ap', or substituting for [p"], [q], [q'] their values, [fplP"Q2 =Lp, QQ'P"[q"] =A [p]P"-Q'2 =Ap". Comparing these equations with the equations (16), and observing that P"t is not zero, we infer that [p']=P', [q"]=Q", [p]P. The matrix reciprocal to the matrix (20) is therefore ?2P, ?2Q", ?2Q' QQ , QPI , QQ . 1(2 2) ?2Q', ?Q, &2Pip~ and, consequently, LAq=Q'Q"PQ, A9, =ppQ Q12 These equations prove that the denominators of q, qI', P11 are divisors of A; i. e. that q, p" are integral numbers, because P" is prime to A. The coefficients of the ternary form f' =iP2 +P1y2 +1piZ2+ 2qyz++2q'xz + 2"gxy are therefore integral; this form is primitive, and represents primitively the form (p, q1, p'); it is also a form of the given invariants [Q, A]; for its discriminant is Az2, and the greatest common divisor of the first minors of its matrix is Q; hence its second invariant is A and its first invariant either + Q, or -?Q. But when the given invariants ?2 and A are both positive, is a positive binary form of the negative determinant MDCCCL~xYJI. 2 r 2a72 POFESSO H.: J. S. SMITH ON THE -OIRhERS --?2P' :; and such a form cannot be represented by an indefinite ternary form of a positive discriminant; f' is therefore definite, and its first invariant is +f?.1 When the given invariants &2 and A are of opposite signs, 3 is a binary form of the positive determinant UP'; such a form cannot be represented by a definite ternary form; f' is therefore indefinite, and, as its invariants must be of opposite signs, in this case also its first invariant is +Q. Also, if p is properly primitive.and P"' uneven, the forms If' and F' are both properly primitive, one of the principal coefficients of each being uneven. In this case, therefore, p is represented by a form of the properly -primitive order [Q2, A]. If @ is improperly primitive (a supposition which implies that 2P"3, mod 4), and if 'A is even, ft is improperly primitive. For no properly primitive ternary form of even discriminant can represent primitively an improperly primitive binary form, the supposition that (p, j", -') is improperly primitive and _p" uneven implying that the discriminant is uneven. And the same thing follows from the preceding analysis; for, considering the equations (18) as congruences for the modulus 2, we find on the supposition that q is improperly primitive, _q=Q', mod 2, mge Q. mod 2, and substituting in (19), p"-t'O, mod 2, so thatf' is improperly primitive. Art. 11. We can now assign a properly primitive form of any given invariants [Q2, A], and of any given generic character satisfying the condition of possibility. Let M be any number prime to 2A, of the same sign as A, and possessing all the particular characters (except the simultaneous character, if any) which are attributed to F in the given generic character; also if Q is uneven, and A uneven or unevenly even, we shall suppose that M . mod 4. Let p be any properly primitive, and not negative binary quadratic form of determinant -2-&M; and let m be any number prime to 2Q2M which is represented by p. By the theory of binary quadratic forms, the generic characters which are attributable to p, are (i) its characters with respect to primes dividing M, (ii) its characters with respect to primes dividing Q, (iii) its supplementary characters. These last are exhibited in the following Table, If -2M Supplementary characters. 1, mod 4. None. 3, mod 4.2 2, mod 8. f (-1)8 6 modS. _ j (.A) .__ ..._, 4, mod 8. (-1)7k . .~~ ___md8 _32+8 0, mod 8.

With respect to the supplementary characters of I, it will be found' on a comparison of the above Table with Table II. A, that, when the proposed generic character includes no simultaneous character, the supplementary characters attribu-, table to p are the same as those attributable to f; we then assign to the supplementary characters of p the same values which are assigned to the supplementary characters of f in the proposed generic character. But when the proposed generic character includes a simultaneous character, there is always a supplementary character (and only one) attributable to o, and not tof; this character of p we determine so that, the value of the simultaneous character of f and F, and the value of the unit similarly formed with m and M, may be coincident. This determination is always possible, as will be seen on a comparison of the cases (S) of Table II. A, with the above Table of supplementary characters of binary forms. As we have now assigned a value to every particular character attributable to p, it is necessary to inquire whether a form A, possessing such a complete character, actually exists; i. e. whether the character that we have assigned to p satisfies the condition of possibility for binary forms of determinant KM.

J. S. SMITH ON THE ORDERS But this equation is the equation (11) of art. 8, which is by hypothesis satisfied by the proposed generic character; therefore the equation (25) is also satisfied; i. e. a properly primitive binary form p exists, of determinant 2M, possessing the generic character which we have assigned to it. This form, multiplied by -A, is a quadratic residue of M; for the equation ( A) 1i is satisfied for every prime dividing M, by virtue of the equations (23). Let, then, a ternary formf, of the properly primitive order, and of the invariants [Q2, A], be determined, representing 0 primitively. The generic character of this form is completely determined by the numbers m and M, which are uneven numbers simultaneously represented byf and F; it is therefore a form of the proposed generic character. Of the two improperly primitive orders, it will suffice to consider that in whichlf is improperly and F properly primitive; so that Q is uneven and A even. Let M be a number prime to 2MA, of the same sign as A, and satisfying the generic characters of F, including the congruence MQ2, mod 4; also let p be an improperly primitive binary form of determinant -f2M; the generic characters attributable to 0 are (i) its characters (h), (ii) its characters (s). These characters we determine, as before, by the equations (23) and (24). The complete generic character thus assigned to p is possible; for the condition that it should be possible is or Transforming ( M ) by the law of reciprocity, we find f F ~~~~~+ (-P) 8 X KA l) =(-l) 2 2 8 X an equation which the proposed generic character satisfies by hypothesis (equation (12) Art. 8). An improperly primitive form p of determinant flM therefore actually exists, having the generic character which we have assigned to it; i. e. ternary forms exist having the proposed generic character. It is evident from the demonstration that if M is of the same sign as A, prime to 2A, and also (when Q is uneven and A uneven or unevenly even) congruous to Q, mod 4, there is always one genus of properly primitive binary forms of determinant -iM capable of primitive representation by a given genus of ternary forms of the properly primitive order [i2, A], of which the contravariant characters coincide with the characters of M. And similarly, if A is even, 2 uneven, M prime to A, and 2, mod 4, there is always one genus of improperly primitive binary forms of determinant -QMI AND GENERA OF TERNARY QUADRATIC FORMS. 275 capable of primitive representation by a given genus of ternary forms of the improperly primitive order [Q2, A], of which the contravariant characters -coincide with the characters of M. And in both cases no other primitive form (if M is prime to a, no other form, primitive or derived) of determinant -QM is capable of such representation. Art. 12. By a rational substitution we shall understand in this article a substitution of which the determinant is unity, and of which the coefficients are rational. If the common denominator of the coefficients is prime to any number m, we shall say that the substitution is prime to m. Iff and f2 are ternary forms, having integral coefficients, of which f, is a form of the invariants (Q2, A), and is transformed by a rational substitution, prime to 2&A, intof2, f2 is a form of the same invariants, of the same order, and of the same genus as fl. This may be proved nearly in the same way in which it is proved that equivalent forms have the same invariants and are of the same order and genus; it is only necessary to observe that F1 and F2, as well as J and f2, are transformable into one another by rational substitutions, prime to 2QA. The converse proposition, "If fG andf2 are two forms of the same invariants (Q. A), of the same order, and of the same genus, they are transformable, each into the other, by rational substitutions prime to 2U2A," is also true, and is of importance in the present theory, because it establishes the completeness of the enumeration of the generic characters of ternary forms. To avoid the introduction, in this place, of principles relating to quaternary quadratic forms, we shall give an indirect demonstration of it, depending on the following lemma which relates to binary quadratic forms. " If s '2 are two primitive binary quadratic forms of the same determinant, and of the same genus, the resolubility of the equation 01(x, y)=M implies the resolubility of the equation p2(x, y)=Mz2;, and in the solution of this equation the value of z may be supposed prime to any given number k." Because Pi and p2 are of the same genus, P2 is transformable, by a bipartite linear substitution, into the product vGX p, X representing a properly primitive form of the principal genus (Disq. Arith. art. 251). But X is transformable, by a quadratic substitution, into the square of a properly primitive form 4 (ibid. art. 287). Therefore, by a mixed quadratic and linear substitution, p2 is transformed into the product 542 X P. Attributing, in this mixed substitution, to the indeterminates of Al the values which satisfy the equation l =M, and to the indeterminates, of 4 any values whatever for which 4 acquires a value z prime to k, we obtain a solution of the equation P2= MZ2. Let us first suppose that the given ternary formsf1 andfg belong to the properly primitive order of the invariants (Q2, A); let M1, M2 be two numbers of the same sign as A, prime to 2&2A, and primitively represented by F1, F2 respectively; we may suppose that M, M2, mod 8; and that the representations of M\,1 and M2 are simultaneous with the representations of uneven numbers by f and g2. Let pl, p, be two binary quadratic forms, of the determinants-Q~gNl,,-QuaM respectively, represented boy f and f2 simul276 PROFESSOR H. J. S. SMITH ON THE ORDERS taneously with therepresentations of M, and M'2 -by F, and F2*. Then @, and Id are properly primitivel; their generic characters with respect to uneven primes dividing 2 will coincide, because their supplementary characters will also coincide;for the same supplementary characters are attributable to p, and P2, and these supplementary characters are determined for pi, in accordance with the supplementary characters off,, or the simultaneous character of f, and F1, and for 9p in accordance with characters which are the same with these; lastly, ifPi is any prime dividing-both MIl and MS, the characters of @, and p2 with respect top will also coincide; for The remaining characters of q~l and 92 (i. e. their characters with respect to primes dividing only -one of the two numbers Ml and M>), being characters with respect to different primes, cannot be incompatible. The complete genericecharacters of 0, and (. are therefore compatible, and are satisfied by the numbers contained in certain arithmetical progressions. Each of these progressions contains (by the theorem of LEJEUNE DIRICHLET) an infinite number of positive and negative primes. Let p be one of these primes of the same sign as, )2, and not dividing 2MA; p will satisfy the generic characters both of {,and p,, and will be. represented by some form of determinant MI, and of the same genus as l,, and by some form of determinant &M2, and of the same genus as (2. . Therefore, by the lemma of this article,p62 will be primitively represented by l 2, and psi2 by 2, 0, and ~2 denoting numbers prime to 22A. Let (,, (P be two properly primitive binary forms represented by F,, F2, simultaneouslyvwith the representations of p~l, p9O, by f,f2. The determinants of (P ( are _A Ap2; and it will be found (as in the case of the forms ,l, 2) that the generic characters of 4P,, 42 are compatible; and that a prime P of the same sign as A, and not dividing 2gA, is assignable, such that POT, P02 are primitively represented by 4)1, (2 respectively, 0l and ?2 denoting numbers prime to 22A. Thus the numabers pO2, P?2 are simultaneously and primitively represented by f and F,; the numbers p6l: PO' are simultaneously and primitively represented byf2 and F2. We may therefore suppose that Al is a form equivalent to fi, in which a, =pOi, A-P?2, and that 42 is a form equivalent toIf M=B("-ti3',a~i-ap3", ah//-a'@) and if f is transformed into a binary form 9 by the substitution =_ M? + R'YE y=aff +P13Y the representations of M by F,. and of f by f, are said to be simultaneous, or to appertain to one another (GAUSS, Disq.

Either of the two forms 4", 4'2 (and consequently either of the two f, f2) is therefore transformable into the other, by a rational substitution prime to 2Q2A. It will be found that if the signs of 0, 01 l2 are properly determined, the primes P, p will not appear in the denominators of these substitutions. Iff1 andf2 belong to an improperly primitive order, the preceding proof requires very little modification. It will suffice to consider the case in which f, and f2 are improperly, F1 and F2 properly primitive. We take M QM2, mod 4; 91 and p2 are then improperly primitive and have compatible generic characters; let 2pO' be represented by p,, and 2p0, by D2; @1 and )2 are properly primitive and of the determinants -2Apdl, -2Ap0,; these forms have compatible generic characters (their supplementary characters, in particular, being determined by those of F, and F2); let, then, P02 be represented by (Dj and P022 by 12, and let us suppose that 419 42 are forms equivalent to 11, f2, in which al 2~p O2 AP032) a21= 2pO2, A2=P0O.; the fractional form V [2(p+&Q)X2 + (2_P)XY +-(P + 2)Y2+p2QAZ21 is transformed into 4' by the substitution ; 1 a1 1 e1?I I 1 2 OH ell 2 103 1 0, ?0 e and into 4' by a similar substitution. The determinant of each of these substitutions is Pp, and the denominators of their coefficients do not contain the prime 2, because by~' hV', A", A", 0?1, 032 are all uneven, and because B --b'_ mod 2, B2--.b2, mod 2. Each of the forms fl, f2 is therefore transformable into the other by a rational substitution prime to 2MA. Art. 13K. We have hitherto considered ternary forms of a negative determinant, definite or indefinite; we shall now confine our attention to definite forms. iBy a binary 278 i PROFESSOR H. J. S. SMITH ON THE ORDERS form we shall henceforward understand a positive form of negative determinant, by a ternary form a positive and definite form; and we shall occupy ourselves in the remainder of this memoir with the determination of the weight of a given genus or order of such ternary forms. A ternary form has always 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 12, or 24_positive automorphics, z. e. automorphics of which the determinant is a positive unit. The weight of a form is the reciprocal of the number of its positive automorphics; so that a form and its contravariant have the same weight; the weight of a class is the weight of any form contained in the class; the weight of a genus or of an order is the sum of the weights of the non-equivalent classes contained in the genus or order. When a number is represented by a ternary form, the weight of the representation is the weight of the ternary form. The weight of a binary form, or class, is also the reciproeal of the number of its positive automorphics; thus the weight of a binary form is always 1-, except when the form either is, or is derived from, a form of determinant -1, or an improperly primitive form of determinant -3; in these excepted cases the weight of the binary form is 4 and 6 respectively. When a binary form is represented by a ternary form, the weight of the "representation is the product of the weights of the two forms. To determine the weight of a given genus of ternary forms, we avail ourselves of the principles introduced into arithmetic by GAUss and DIIiCHLET, and employed by them to determine the number of binary forms of any given determinant. Let (f, F) represent a given genus of ternary forms of the invariants [Q2, A], and either of the properly primitive order, or of that improperly primitive order in which .f is improperly and F properly primitive. Let f, f2, .. or (f) denote a system of forms representing the classes of the given genus; F1, F2, ... or (F), the primitive contravariants of those forms. Let M represent any positive number, prime to 2QA and satisfying the generic characters of F; when (f, F) is a properly primitive genus; ? being uneven, and A uneven or unevenly even, we shall also suppose that M satisfies the congruence QM-1i mod 4: the numbers designated by M will be subject to the restrictions here stated throughout the whole investigation. Lastly, let L be a positive quantity which we shall afterwards suppose to increase without limit; Iand let T be the sum of the weights of the representations by the forms (F) of all the numbers M which do not surpass L. The quotient T ?. LD approximates to a finite limit, when L is increased without limit. Of this limit, we shall obtain two distinct expressions, the one containing as a factor the weight W of the genus (f, F), the other not containing that factor, and depending on the arithmetical relation which subsists between the sum of the weights of the representations of a given number M by the forms (F), and the sum of the weights of the properly or improperly primitive binary classes of determinant ?M. A comparison of the two expressions will then give the required weight of the genus (f, F). Art. 14.The first determination of the limit of the quotient T PL depends on the following auxiliary propositions, in which F represents any form of the system (F). (1) If w is-an unevent primne dividing , F acquires a value prime to 2 for /k( I X systems of values of x, y, z, mod b. AND GENERA OF TERNARY QUADRATIC FORMIS. 279 As, instead off and F, we may consider any forms equivalent to f and F, we may suppose thatfJand F satisfy, for any assigned powers of the uneven primes dividing ?A, the congruences of Art. 5, f =-= +f3x2Py2+yQ2+ A2X F=y--zy 2 A cyrZV + f3z2, oc43yeBl. The congruence F3_O, mod I, is then satisfied by 62 systems of values of x, z, mod 3; for z must be divisible by I, but x and y may have any values, mod 8; F is therefore prime to b for the remaining Y(t I) systems of values of x, y, z, mod b. (2) If w is an uneven prime dividing Q, but not A, F is prime to Q, for c(c-1) a(if) ) systems of values of x, y, z, mod cS. For if F O, mod a, x may have any value,, mod a, but y and z must have values satisfying he congruence ry2+y z-2O0, mod w. If ( -1, the only values of y and z that satisfy this congruence are y-0, z=0, mod e; and the congruence F-O, mod e,, is satisfied by & systems of values of a, y, z, mod x. If ( + 1, the congruence yAy2+Pz'0, mod w, is satisfied by 2c-1 systems of values of y and z; in this case therefore the congruence F==0, mod a, admits of w(2cw1) solutions. And, observing that ( r)=(fX)-( ),we find in both cases alike that F is prime to w for w(c~-l)(.w(io ) ) systems of values of a, y, z, mod w. (3) It is evident from the congruence F==AX2+A/y2+A"z2, mod 2, in which one at least of the numbers A, A', A" is uneven, that F acquires an uneven value for 4 out of the 8 systems of values, mod 2, which can be attributed to x, y, z. (4) If 2A is uneven, the number of solutions of the congruence 2F-1, mod 4, is 8 (2 -T). For this congruence may be written in the form (art. 6) ax2+ Y3&2+yz2=1, mod 4, a, 3, y representing uneven numbers which satisfy the congruence &+i3+ry+10, mod 4. Of the three numbers x, q, z one must be uneven, the other two even. The number of solutions in which x is uneven, y and z even, is 8 or 0, according as a==+l, or 1, mod 4. The whole number of solutions is therefore r a-l l -1 V-I 12+4 -1 ) 2 + 1) 2 +1) 2] i. e. 24, or 8, according as the congruences acP{rnzl, mod 4 are, or are not satisfied; or again (Art. 6), according as T= -,1 or TY+1. The congruence QF==1, mod 4, admits therefore of 8(2T) solutions.. MDcccLXvII. 2 Q 280 PROFESSOR H. J. S. SMITH ON THE ORDERS (5) If Q is uneven, and A unevenly even, f as well as F being properly primitive, there are 16 solutions of the congruence f2F=1, mod 4; for this congruence may be written in the form (Art. 6) 2a2+2f3y2+yz2=1, mod 4. For clearness, we shall henceforward represent by r any uneven prime dividing both 52 and A, by w any uneven prime dividing A, but not U; by a any uneven prime dividing Q, but not A. Let O=2-A, if Q-A-1, mod 2; =2, if, f and F being properly primitive, 2 is uneven and A unevenly even; 0=4 in every other case; also let V= 4lr X 1J X IH, 4/(V) = 8V I H. 1 I [11 ~11I ~_-fl Combining the lemmas (1)... (5) we obtain the theorem"The form F represents numbers of the series M for 4+ (V) of the V' systems of valuesmod V, that can be attributed to XI yI z." Let xi, yi, zi represent one of these 4(V) systems of values; it is evident that F represents a number of the series, M for every system of values of XI y, z included in the formulae y = VY +y, $ $ e * * * * * * * v (2 7) z =VZ +zi, in which X, Y, Z represent any integral numbers whatever.

Art. 15. The second determination of the limit of the quotient T -LI depends on the following theorem: " The sum of the weights of the primitive representations by the forms (F) of a given number M divisible by pi unequal primes, is 2'1 times the weight of a genus of binaryforms, of determinant QM, and properly or improperly primitive, according as the forms (f) are properly or improperly primitive." The principles which give the demonstration of this theorem are contained in Arts. 280-284 of the 'Disquisitiones Arithmetice,' and have been in part already employed, in Art. 10 of this memoir. We have shown in Art. 11 that one genus and only one of binary forms of determinant -f2M admits of primitive representation by the forms (f) of the ternary genus (f, F). Let 01, 02,.. . or (0) be a system of forms representing the classes of that binary genus; these forms are properly or improperly primitive, according as the forms (f) are properly or improperly primitive: let n be their number and v the sum of their weights; as their weights are all equal, the weight of each of them is o; SO that each has positive automorphics, and is transformed into any equivalent form by v positive substitutions. We shall first show that the sum of the weights of the primitive representations of the forms (0) by the forms (f) is equal to 2' x ; and secondly, that the sum of the weights of the primitive representations of the numbers M by the forms (F) is equal to the sum of the weights of the primitive representations of the forms (9) by the forms (f). (i) Each of the n congruences -AO (Qx -Q'y) , mod M .(32) in which Q, Q' are the numbers to be determined, is resoluble, and admits of 2tk incongruous solutions. From each such solution we deduce, by the method of GAUSS employed in Art. 10, a ternary form f' of the given genus, containing one of the forms (O) as a part, and having Q, Q', M for the coefficients of 2yz, 2xz, Z2 in its primitive contravariant. There are 2Txn of these forms (f'); none of them is the same as any other, and none of them can be transformed into any other by a substitution of the type 2 q2 2S82 PROFESSOR H. J. S. SMITH ON THE ORDERS 1, 0, a' 0, 1,z.v . (33) 0,0 1 for if one of them could be so transfornfed into another, these two would contain as a part the same form P, and the values of Q, Q' in the primitive contravariant of the one would be congruous, for the modulus M, to the values of Q, Q' in the primitive contravariant of the other; the two forms would thus be derived from the same solution of the same congruence (32). Again, the primitive representations of the forms (95) by the forms (f) are equal in number to the positive transformations of the forms (f) into the forms (f'). For every positive transformation of a form of (f) into a form of (fi) supplies a primitive representation of some form of (4) by that form of (f); and these representations are all different, because the same form f cannot be transformed into two of the forms (f'), or twice into one of them, by positive substitutions of which the first two columns are the same; otherwise one of the forms (fI) could be transformed into another by a substitution of the type (33), or else one of those forms would have an automorphic of that type, whereas no substitution of the type (33), in which X and x? are different from zero, can be an automorphic of any ternary form. There are therefore at -least as many different primitive representations of the forms (p) by the forms (f), as there are positive transformations of the forms (f) into the forms (f'). And there are no more;. for if ce', /3' is a given primitive representation of p byf, let y, y', y" be numbers which render the determinant of the substitution oe', At, 7'.. . s . . (34) equal to +1; and let fi be the form, containing 5 as a part, into which f is transformed by the substitution (34). The coefficient of z2 in the primitive contravariant of/f is M, and if the coefficients of 2yz, 2xz in that contravariant are Q1, QA, these numbers supply a solution of the congruence (32). Letf' be that form of (f') which is deduced from this solution; then f is equivalent tof', and is transformed into it by a substitution of the type (33), in which zzx !'"Q-'Q Therefore if is transformed intof' by the substitution M /3A, r +z'z +x/ AND GENERA OF TERNARY QUADRATIC FORMS. 283 'i. e. the given primitive representation of 9 byf is included among those supplied by the {positive transformations of the forms (f) into the forms (f'). Thus the number of the primitive representations of the forms (9) by the forms (f) is equal to the 'number of the positive transformations of the forms (f) into the forms (f'): to obtain the sum of the weights of these representations, we consider, in particularf one of the forms of (f); let d be the number of its positive automorphics, so that is its weight. and let s be the number of the forms (f') which are equivalent to it. Then there are ds primitive representations of the forms (9) byf; but the weight of each of these representations is X the sum of the weights of the primitive representations of the forms (9) by f is therefore SX_. Extending this conclusion to all the forms of (f), and observing that Is is equal n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ to the number of the forms (If'), i. e. to 21h X n, we find that the sum of the weights of the primitive representations of the forms (9) by the forms (f) is 21 x Y. (ii) Let M=F(F, F', F") be a given primitive representation of M by F; and let a!t, j3'. . . . . . . . , * * (35) I aex', j3U 1 be a matrix, of which the constituents satisfy the equations a f3u.-atl3=F, a!'f3.-3" a=F' f3'!f3=F". . . . . (36) All the matrices, of which the constituents satisfy these equations, are then included in the formula ., (. aI, 3' XIVI .(37) an, f". . in which'f v is a square binary 'matrix of which the determinant is +1. Thus the binary forms; which are represented by f simultaneously with the given representation of M by F, are all equivalent to one another, and to some form of (p); let p be that form of (p) to which they are equivalent, and let us suppose (as we may do) thatf is transformed into p by the substitution (35). Substituting successively for I v I in the formula (37), the n positive automorphics of p, we obtain ; representations of p by f: these representations are all different, and they include every representation of p by f which is simultaneous with' the given representation of NI by F: the weight of each of them is d X -; the sum of their weights is therefore equal to d, or to the weight of the given representation of M by F. Hence the sum of the weights of all the primitive representations of M by the forms (F) is equal to the sum of the weights of the simul'taneous representations of the forms (p) by the forms (if), or, which is the same thing, 284 PROFESSOR H. J. S. SMITH ON THE ORDERS to the sum of the weights of all the primitive representations of the forms (p) by the forms (f); because every primitive representation of a form (p) by'a form (f) is simultaneous with one and only one primitive representation of M by a form (F). Combining the conclusions (i) and (ii), we obtain the result enunciated at the beginning of this article. Art. 16. Let a represent the number of uneven primes dividing Q, counting those which also divide A; let d'=1, when 2M_-1, mod 4*; a'= +1, when Q-0, mod 8; and o-=0 in all other cases.

Or, if we represent by H(&2M) the sum of the weights of those uneven binary classes of determinant -&2M which are prime to Q, and by H'(i2M) the sum of the weights of those even classes of determinant iM which are prime to Q, the sum of the weights of all the representations of M by the forms (F) is H(nM) H'(flM 2n s2or2+' according as the forms (f) are properly or improperly primitive.

Again, representing by (2y) the absolute value of 2y, we observe that a reduced binary form is a form (x, y, z) of which the coefficients satisfy the inequalities, (i) X>0 ~ z>Ou x> (2y)-<z, S 1 z . . . . . . . (41) (ii) If a=(2y), y>0( If az, yO. and that, by a fundamental proposition in the theory of binary forms, every class contains one and only one reduced form. Attending only to those uneven classes of determinant -QM which are prime to Q, and comparing the inequalities (40) and (41), we find that the sum (38) contains (i) an unit corresponding to every pair of reduced forms (x, y, z), (x, -y, z) of which the coefficients satisfy none of the equalities y=O, x=2y, x=z; (ii) one-half of an unit corresponding to every reduced form of which the coefficients satisfy one of them; and (iii) one-fourth of an unit corresponding to a reduced form (if there be such a form of determinant -Q2M prime to Q) of which the coefficients satisfy the two equalities, y=O, x=z, and of which the weight is consequently 4. We thus obtain the equation H(2M) = ''~qxz_ 12 M]. Again, attending only to those even classes of the uneven determinant ?fM which are prime to 2, we find that the sum (39) contains units corresponding to pairs of reduced forms, and half units corresponding to single reduced forms; it also contains one-sixth of an unit corresponding to a reduced form (if there be such a reduced form of determinant -Q2M prime to S2) of which the coefficients satisfy the three equalities x= 2y, 2y=z, x=z, and of which the weight is consequently 6' We therefore have the equation H'(QM)= ='[xz -y2= SM].

For its application here the following preliminary lemmas are requisite, relating to the arithmetical properties of the function 2 xz y. 286, PROFESSOR HI. J. S. SMITH ON THE ORDERS (1) If p is any uneven prime, and mn any given number, the congruence xz-Yy2-m, modp, .(42) admits of p [r+(.-m)] solutions. For if (npm) =+1, yf+m is prime to p for p-2 values of y, and is divisible by p for 2 values of y. When y12+mn is prime to p, we may assign to z any value prime to p, determining x by the congruence xz_ y2 -m; we thus obtain (p-l)(p2) solutions of (42). When y2+m is divisible. by p, the congruence z0, mod p, admits of 2p-I solutions; we thus obtain in all (p I)(p-2)+2(2p-l)=p(p+l) solutions of (42). If (p7) = -1, y2 +rn2 is prime to p for every value of y; there are thus p p-l) solutions of (42). Lastly, if ( ) =0, i. e. if en_ 0, mod p, y2+Mn is prime to p for p-i values of y, and divisible by p for one value of y. There are thus (p 1)2+2p-1=p2 solutions of (42). We shall have to use the following corollary of this lemma, If mn is prime to p, and if we successively attribute to x, y, z the p3 systems of values, mod p, of which they are susceptible, xzf y will have the same quadratic character as forn ip(p-)Fp+ (m)]of these systems. (2) The congruences xzy2 1, 3 5, 7, mod 8, each admit 48 solutions in which x and z are not simultaneously even; of the congruences, Xz -y2 -3, 7, mod 8, the first admits 16, the second 48 solutions in which x and z are simultaneously even. For example, let the proposed congruence be Xz -y2 3, mod 8. If y has one of its four even -values, mod 8, we may give to z any one of its four uneven values, mod 8, and determine the value of x in the resulting congruence; we thus obtain 4 x 4 solutions in which x and z are uneven. If y has one of its four uneven values, mod 8, the congruence becomes -xz4, mod 8, which admits of 8 solutions in which x and z are not simultaneously even, and 4 in which they are simultaneously even. There are thus (4 x 4)+(4 x 8)=48 solutions of the congruence xz -y 3, mod 8, in which x and. z are not simultaneously even, and 4 x 4=16 in which x and z are simultaneously even. (3) If p is any prime, even or uneven, i and i' integral exponents, of which i 0, i' > 0, and ?n any given number, prime to p, or divisible by any power of p, the congruence Xz-y2 mpt, mod p i-.(43) admits Of p2i+2i(i-.2) primitive solutions, i. e solutions in which x, y, z, or, which is the same thing, x, z are not simultaneously divisible by p. (i) If the assertion is true for i, i', and if j<i', it is true for i+j, i'j. For, on writing npi for m in (43), it becomes AND GENERA OF TERNARY QUADRATIC FORMS. 287 if therefore the former congruence admits 2i +2 2 __ 2(i+j)+2(i-j) (i-2) p _~P primitive solutions, the latter does so too. (ii) If the assertion is true for i, 0, it is also true for i, i', where int. For if x), , z is a given primitive solution of xZy-2Mpi, modp, .(44) Xpi+x, Ypi+y, Zpx+z is a primitive solution of (43), whenever X, Y, Z satisfy the congruence Xz-2Yy+Zx+ z-i Y-M, mod p'. This congruence admits Of 2i' solutions; for the given numbers x and z are not simultaneously divisible by p. Thus from each primitive solution of (44) we obtain p2it primitive solutions of (43). These solutions are all differert, and exhaust all the solutions of (43); if therefore (44) admits of p2i (i -.) solutions, (43) admits of p2i+2i'( 1-) solutions. (iii) The assertion is true if i=1, '_0. For (lemma 1) there are p2 solutions of the congruence XZ-y290, modp, and of these one is not primitive. The proposition is, therefore, true universally. We shall have to employ the following corollaries from it. (1) The function Xz -yf is divisible bypi, but not byp'+1, for p2i(p _ 1)2(p+1) systems of values of x, y, z, modpi+l ; the values of , y, z not being simultaneously divisible byp. (2) If p is an uneven prime, the quotients obtained by dividing these p2i(pp _.i)2(p + 1) values of Li 2yS by pt, are half quadratic residues, and half non-quadratic residues of p. (3) If p=-2, the function x_ -y2 is divisible by 2i, but not by 2+1", for 3 x 2 2i+ systems of values of , z, mod 2+3' the values of x, y, z not being simultaneously even.

Lastly, let us consider the even prime 2, and let 2' be the highest power of 2 dividing QU. Considering separately the 'eighteen cases of the Tables (i) and (ii), we find that' of the 2`t+ systems of values of X,' , z, mod 2 3~~~~~ XX ,23'i+X systems (in which x, y, z are not simultaneously even, but x and z are or are not simultaneously even, according as the forms (f) are improperly or properly primitive) give to Y an integral and uneven value, satisfying the supplementary character (if any) of F, and, if the forms (f ) are properly primitive,; satisfying the congruence xz -y=l1, mod 4, when Q2 is uneven, and A uneven or unevenly even. For example, let i>1-, /\--O, mod 8. Here F, or -2i F. has two supplementary characters, and of the 2`9 systems of values of x, z, mod 2i+3, 3X X 2`+9 X systems, -_ 42 in which x and z are not simultaneously even, give to an integral and uneven 2i value, satisfying the supplementary characters of F (Lemma iii.

In the former case, of the 2 systems of values of x,' y, z, mod 2i+3,' 3 X 12 X 23i+ X systems (in which x and z are not simultaneously even) give to 2i an integral and uneven value satisfying the supplementary character of F. In the latter case, of the same 23i+9 systems of values, 83 X 1 X 23t X systems, z-y in which x and z are not simultaneously even, give to an integral and uneven value, Both results are comprised in the formula r X_3+(1) 12 X 2t As a third example, let i= 0, A _ 0, mod 4, and let the forms considered be of an improperly primitive order.

The congruence xz-y2-2F, mod 8, in which only even values of x and z are to be admitted, is satisfied in the former case by 16, in the latter by 48 systems; i. e. in either case by 3x Q-2-1+F2-1 3XilSL2+(1)8 s 8J X29 systems. The formula (45) results immediately from the combination of these determinations relative to the primes 8, w, r, and 2. Art. 20. Let xi, yi, zi be one of the p(V) systems of values of x, y, z, mod V, defined in the last article; and let us decompose the sum T of art. 18 into p(V) partial sums Ti, T2, ..., comprising in the sum TY all those terms of T in which x, y, z are of the linear forms X-Vx +xi, VY-LY+Yj, z-VZ?+z, X, Y, Z denoting any integral numbers whatever. The sum Tli is equal to the number of points having their positive rectangular coordinates of the forms Xvx+xi Y VY+y ?I _vz+zi VflL and lying within the hyperboloidal cuneus, bounded by the planes y= 0, x=z, x=2y, and the hyperboloid xz-y2=1; points lying on the hyperboloidal boundary are counted as lying within the cuneus; points lying on its plane boundaries are counted as l each, and points lying on the intersection of y= 0 with x=z, and with x= 2y respectively as 4 and 6. Let V be the volume of the cuneus, and let L be increased without limit; we have T 3 V lim L-3-2 X V3 and since this limit is thus ascertained to be the same for all the partial sums T1, t'2,.., T S (v lim 2X X V or, which is the same thing, limh x Ut = , X V.

Art. 21. The equation (47) may also be deduced from the theorem of Art. 15 by another method. We consider first and principally the case in which the forms (f) and (F) are both properly primitive.

The limit of this sum is 3X M,3 X so that the limit of the sum (50) is If n is divisible by any prime other than the primes o, the symbols (7?X-) are one half equal to + 1, and one half equal to -1; in this case, therefore, the limit of the sum (50) is zero.

Art. 22. The weight of an order (Art. 13) is the sum of the weights of the genera contained in the order.

From this definition it is evident that in the sum R, we may substitute for any factor of the form 2 + (a})f8J or 1fi + (j-F) 1] a factor of the form (54) or outside the sign of summation, And similarly for any factor J -h) we may substitute the factor 1 outside the sign of summation. Observing that the factors (54) and (55) are all positive units, we obtain immediately R= HI Again, if a prime r divide Q. or Al, the sum R' vanishes, being composed of pairs of terms equal in absolute magnitude and opposite in sign; if, for example, r divide Q2, the two terms in one of which i), contained in 2i is +1, and in the other -I, but which are in other respects identical, will destroy one another.

We may determine sepaAf? 1 rately the weights of those genera for which (-1) 2 -1, and of those for which Af + (-1)-2 -+1. In a genus of the former kind the characters may have any assigued values because the condition of possibility is (-1) 2 (Qf)(^)=(-1)2 2 Therefore the sum of the weights of these genera is -8 X'XR, or 32 XI, because X =4. But in a genus of the latter kind the characters (56), or some of them, are subject to the condition (/s,)(>1) (1) 2 (57) we have therefore to consider a sum of which the general term is the same as that of R, but into which only those terms are admitted which are formed with values of (f) and F\ ( ) satisfying the condition (57).
