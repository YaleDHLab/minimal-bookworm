[185] XVIII. On the Resolution of attractive Powers. By Edward Waring, M. D. F. R. S. and Lucasian Professor of Mathematics at Cambridge. Read May 28, 1789. 1. A FORCE acting at a given point may be resolved by an infinite number of ways into two, three, or more (n) forces acting at the same point, either in the same or different planes with the given force and each other; and, vice versa, any number of such forces acting in the same or different planes may be reduced into one. Ex. Fig. 1. Tab. III. Let a body A be acted on by three forces AB, AC, and AD, not being in the same plane; reduce any two of them AB and AC to one AE, by compleating the parallelogram ABEC; then reduce the two forces AE and AD to one AF by completing the parallelogram AEFD, and the three forces AB, AC, and AD, are reduced to the one AF. 2. If n forces act on the body A at the same time, and any (n 1) of them be reduced to one, the force resulting will be situated in the same plane with the remaining, and force equivalent to the (n) forces. 3. If one force a be resolved into several others x, y, z, v, &c. situated in different planes, and the sines of the angles, which the forces y, z, v, &c. contain with the plane made by the direction of the forces x and a be respectively s, s', s'', &c. then will sy~s'z~s''v~&c. = 0.

Given the law of attraction of each of the parts of a given line in terms of their distance from a given point P; to find the attraction of the whole line ab on the point P. Find the attraction of the line ab on the point P in the two directions Pf and fb by the following method. Draw Px from the point P to any point x of the line ab, the force acting on the point P by the particle xy will be the given function (determined from the given law of attraction) of the distance into the particle; draw also Ph perpendicular from the point P to the line ab, and let Pf = a, hf = b, and fx = y; then will the distance Px = ~ (a2 ~ 2by+y2), and the function of the distance into the particle xy = ~ (~ (a2 ~ 2by+y2)) Xy = F (y) Xy; let this be denoted by lx situated in the line Px, which resolve into two others nx = yy x F: (y)/Px = ~ (a2 ~ 2by + y2) situated in the line ab, and ln (in a direction parallel to Pf) = ay x F: (y)/~ (a2 ~ 2by + y2); find the fluents of the fluxions yy x F: (y)/Px and ay x F: (y)/Px contained between the values af and fb of the line fx = y, which suppose Y and V respectively; through the point p draw Py parallel to fb = Y, and in the line Pf assume Pu = V; complete the parallelogram Puzy; Pz will be the force of the line ab on the point P. Cor. If F: (y) varies as any power or root (2n) of the distance Px = ~ (a2 ~ 2by + y2), and n 1/2 be an integer affirmative number or ~, the fluents Y and V of both the fluxions can be found in finite algebraical terms of y; if n 1/2 be an integer negative number, both the fluents can be found in the above1 mentioned Resolution of attractive Powers. 187 mentioned finite terms together with the arc of a circle, whose radius is ~ a2 b2 and tangent y~b, unless n 1/2 = ~, in which case the fluent Y involves that circular arc, and also the logarithm of y2 ~ 2by + a2. If n 1/2 denotes a fraction whose denominator is 2, both the fluents can be expressed by the finite terms together with the log. of y~b + ~ (y2 ~ 2by + a2). If the fluents be given, when n is a given quantity, and n 1/2 not a whole affirmative number, from them can be deduced the fluents of any fluxions resulting by increasing or diminishing n by a whole number, unless in the above-mentioned case of n 1/2 = 1. If b = 0, and consequently ~ the line Pf is perpendicular to the given line ab, the fluent Y will be expressed by the finite terms, unless n 1/2 = 1, in which case it will be as 1/2 log. (y2 + a2) when properly corrected. These fluxions Y and V may be transformed into others, whose variable quantity is Px = u the distance from P, by substituting in the fluxions for y and y their respective values ~ (u2 a2 + b2)~b and uu/~ (u2 a2 + b2), and consequently for ~ (y2 ~ 2by + a2) its value u. P R O B L E M II. Fig. 3. Given the attraction of each of the parts of a given surface in terms of their distance from a given point P, and an equation expressing the relation between an absciss Ap = x, and its correspondent ordinates pm = y of the surface; to find the attraction of the surface on the given point P. First, by the preceding proposition find the attractions Y and V of any ordinate m p m' in the directions of the ordinate pm and of the line Pp; and from the equation expressing the relation 188 Dr. WARING on the relation between the absciss and ordinates of the given curve, find the absciss in terms of the ordinates (pm) = ~: (y), and thence x = ~: (y) X y and ~ (a'2 ~ 2sa' x + x2) = ~': (y), where PA = a' and s = cosine of the angle, which the absciss Ap makes with the line PA; then find the fluents of the three fluxions x X Y = y X Y X ~: (y), x X V x x/~ (a'2 ~ 2sa' x + x2 = ~: (y) X y X ~: (y)/~: (y) X V and x X a'V/~ (a'2 ~ 2sa' x + x2) = y X a'V/~': (y)contained between the values of y, which correspond to the extreme values of x, which suppose Y', V', and Z; and draw through the point P the lines Py and Pz respectively parallel to the ordinates pm and to the absciss Ap and equal to r X Y' and V'; assume Pu in the line (PA)=t X Z, r and t denoting the sines of the angles, which the ordinates pm and line AP make with the absciss Ap: reduce these three forces Py, Pz, and Pu, to one Pf, and Pf will be the force of the surface on the point P. Cor. 1. If for y and y be substituted their values in terms of x and x, deduced from the equation expressing the relation between the absciss Ap and ordinate pm of the given curve, thence will be deduced the above-mentioned fluents Y, V, Y', V', and Z, in terms of x; and in the same manner, if for x and x be substituted in the fluxions or fluents resulting their values ~ (u2 a'2 + 12 a'2)~sa', and its fluxion, there will result the above-mentioned fluxions or fluents in terms of u the distance from the point P. Cor. 2. Let the curve be a circle, of which A is the center, PA a line perpendicular to the plane of the circle, and the ordinate pm perpendicular to the absciss Ap; the forces on each side of the absciss Ap will be equal, and the force in the direc6 tion Resolution of attractive Powers. 189 tion of the absciss Ap will be equal to that in the contrary direction; the force in the direction (PA) = 4 x ~ au/~(u2 a2) x ~ uy/~u2 + y2 x F: (~(u2 + y2)) = W, in which F: (~u2 + y2) is the function of the distance, according to which the given force on the particles varies; the fluent ~ uy/~(u2 + y2) x F: ~(u2 + y2) is contained between the values o and ~(r2 + a2 u2) of the quantity y, and the fluent W is contained between the values a and ~(a2 + r2) of the quantity u, where a = PA and r the radius of the circle; but the same force is = 2 x 3,14159 &c. x ~ au x F: (u), where F: (u) denotes the given function of the distance (u), and the fluent is contained between the values a and ~a2 + r2 of u. P R O B L E M III. To find the attraction of a given solid on a given point P. Find the attraction of every parallel section on that point by the preceding problem, and multiply it into the correspondent fluxion of the first abscissa AP, and also find the fluent of the resulting fluxion, which, properly corrected, multiply into the fine of the angle, which the first abscissa makes with the parallel sections, and the product will be proportional to the attraction of the solid on the given point P. 2. Fig. 4. Let the solid ABCH be generated by the rotation of a given curve round its axis AB, which passes through the point attracted P, and this solid be supposed to consist of small evanescent solids, whose bases are the surfaces EF, ef, &c. of spheres, of which the center is P, and altitudes Ff, &c. the VOL. LXXIX. G g incre190 Dr. WARING on the increments of the base AB contained between the two contiguous surfaces EF and ef: from the points E and e of the curve draw ED and ed perpendicular to the axis AB, and ES perpendicular to the arc Ee of the given curve at the point E, and meeting the axis AB in S; then will the evanescent solid EFse = p x PE x FD x Ff = p x FD x PS x Dd (because Ff = PSxDd/PE) = p x ~(z2 + y2) z x zz = yy, where z and y denote respectively the absciss PD, and its correspondent ordinate DE of the given curve. The increment of the attraction of the surface EF on the point P in the direction PD will be as the increment of the surface (p x PE x Dd) x PD/PE x force of each particle = p x PD x Dd x given force of the particle; but the fluent of the fluxion PD x Dd contained between the points E and F is = 1/2 PE2 1/2 PD2 = 1/2 ED2, whence the attraction of the evanescent solid EFse is as 1/2 p x ED2 x Ff x F: (~x2 + y2) force of each given particle at the distance (PE = ~(x2 + y2)) = 1/2p x ED2 x PS/PE x Dd x F: (~z2 + y2) = 1/2 py2 x zz~yy/~(z2 + y2) x F: (~(z2 + y2)); the fluent of which, properly corrected, is as the attraction of the solid on the point P; p denotes the circumference of a circle, whose radius is 1. Cor. 1. The fluxion of this solid is 1/2 py2 z = Y which deduced from the preceding principles = p x (~(z2 + y2) z) x (zz = yy) = V, and consequently their fluents between two values of z, which correspond to two values of y = o, will be equal to each other. Cor. Resolution of attractive Powers. 191 Cor. 2. The increment of the attraction of this solid as given in this proposition 1/2 p x y2 x zz = yy/~(z2 + y2) x F: (~(z2 + y2) = U, but in the preceding proposition the force of a circle on the point P = p x ~ au x F: (u), where u = ~(z2 + y2) and a = z, and y or u the only variable quantity contained in the fluxion; and consequently the fluxion of the attraction of the solid p x z ~ z yy/~z2 + y2 x F: ((z2 + y2)1/2) = W; therefore, if for the fluent of zyy/~(z2 + y2) x F: ((z2 + y2)1/2) be substituted its fluent contained between the values a and the value of y, which in the given equation corresponds to z; then the fluents of U and W contained between the two values of z, which corresponds to two values of y = o, will be equal to each other. The difference of the fluents of Y and V, &c. contained between any other two values of z, can easily be deduced from the difference of two segments of spheres. 1. It may not be improper to remark in this place, that from different methods of finding the sum of quantities, the fluents of fluxions, the integrals of increments, &c. quantities may often be deduced equal, which otherwise cannot without some difficulty; of which instances are contained in the Meditations, and I shall here subjoin one or two more to those already given in this Paper. Ex. 1. Any curvilinear area ABC, &c. may be supposed to consist of evanescent areas EFef, of which the base EF is the arc of a circle, whose radius is PE = ~(z2 + y2) and sine ED = y, and altitude Ff, and consequently the fluxion of the area = Ff x arc (A) of a circle whose radius is PE and sine ED = G g 2 PS 192 Dr. WARING on the PS/PE x z x A = zz~yy/~ (z2+y2) x A = V; the fluent of V contained between the two values of z which correspond to two values of (y) = 0 will be equal to the fluent of yz contained between the same two values of z. Ex. 2. The attraction of any circular arc EF in the direction PD on a point P (P being the center of a circle, of which EF is an arc, and ED the sine of that arc) will be as ED x force at distance PE = ED x F: (PE); for the attraction in the direction PDll'F at the point x is as the increment of the arc xy X F: (PE) x Pl/Px (xl and yl' being at right angles to PF) = U x Px/xl x Pl/Px x F: (PE) = U' x?l/~ x F: (PE) = uu/~ PE2 u2 x F: (PE), if u = Pl; and consequently the fluent of it is as ~ PE2 u2 x F: (PE) = ED x F: (PE), and the attraction of the surface EFef will be as ED x Ff x F: (PE) = ED x z x PS/PE x F: (PE) = y x zz~yy/~ (z2+y2) x F: ((z2+y2)1/2 = V; the attraction of the curve will also vary as ~ z ~ zu x F: ((u2+z2)1/2)/(z2+u2)1/2 = W, in which the fluent of zu x F: ((z2+u2)1/2)/(z2+u2)1/2 is contained between u = 0 and u = y; the fluents of V and W contained between two values of z, which correspond to two values of y = 0, will be equal to each other. 2. From a similar method may be deduced equalities between other like fluents, for the curve may be supposed to consist of other similar curve surfaces equally as circles, and the solid of similar segments of other solids equally as spheres. 3. From the same principles may innumerable serieses equal to each other be deduced; for by different converging serieses find Resolution of attractive Powers. 193 find the sum of the same quantity or quantities, and there will result serieses equal to each other: for instance (fig. 5), if the time of falling down the arcs AC and BC and their interpolations from the principles delivered in the Meditationes Analyticae, of which the difference let be D; find the difference between the times of a body's falling through BC when it began to fall from A and from B by a series proceeding according to the dimensions of AB = 0~ a small quantity; and find, by a series of the same kind, the time of falling through AB; the sum of these two serieses will be equal to D. Similar propositions may be deduced from fluxional equations. 4. In some cases the ratios of the times of bodies falling through some particular distances to each other may be easily known; for instance, let the force vary as the m 1 power of the distance (x), and a be the distance from which the body began to fall, then the velocity varies as ~ (am xm), and the increment of the time as x/~ (am xm); but if the parts of different curves are proportional, then will a, x, and x vary in the same ratio as each other, and consequently the time through proportional parts of the distance will vary as a2-m/2; and if the bodies be resisted likewise by a force which varies as the 2m-2/m power of the velocities, then the times through proportional parts will vary as before, that is, as a2-m/2, where a denotes the proportional distances from the points where the forces and resistances are equal. P R O194 Dr. WARING on the P R O B L E M IV. 1. Fig. 6. Given an equation expressing the relation between the two abscissae z = AP and x = Pp and their correspondent ordinates y = pm of a solid, to find its solid contents contained between two values of its first abscissae z. Assume z as an invariable quantity, and from the equation resulting find the fluent Z of yx contained between the extreme values of x or y; then find the fluent of Zz contained between the given values of z, and the fluent multiplied into the product of the sines of the angles, which the first abscissa makes with the plane of the ordinates and second absciss, and the second absciss makes with its correspondent ordinates, will be the solid content required. 2. Fig. 7. Let the first absciss z of a solid be perpendicular to the planes of the ordinates, and the second absciss Pp = x perpendicular to the ordinates themselves pm = y. First, assume the first absciss as invariable, and find the increment of the arc p'm = (x2 + y2)1/2, then assume the second absciss Pp as constant, and let mu be the fluxion of the ordinate y or u, when the fluxion of the first absciss is z = ul, where ul is perpendicular to the plane of the ordinates p'pm, and l a point of the surface of the solid; draw uh perpendicular to the arc p'm, and since ul is constituted at right angles to the plane pp'm, lh will cut the arc p'm at right angles; but uh = um x pp'/p'm = ux/~ (x + y2), lh = (hu2 + lu2)1/2 = (ux/x2+y2 + z2)1/2 the fluxion of the surface will be lh x ~ (x2 + y2). From the given equation expressing the relation between the two abscissae z and x and ordinates y find, by assuming z invariable px=y, and by assuming x invariable qz= 4 y' = u, Resolution of attractive Powers. 195 y'=u, which being substituted for their values in the quantity lh x ~(x2+y2), there will result (q2+p2+1)1/2xxxz=Axz= (q2+p2+1)1/2/pxyxz=Byz; in A and B for y and x respectively substitute their value deduced from the given equation, and let the resulting quantities be A'xz and B'yz, where A' is a function of x and z, and B' a function of y and z; find the fluent of A'xz from the supposition that x is only variable contained between the extreme values of x to a given value of z, which let be Lz, then find the fluent of Lz by supposing z only variable contained between given values of z, and it will be the surface of the solid contained between those values. The same may be deduced by finding the fluent of B'yz on the supposition that y is the only variable quantity contained between the extreme values of y as before of x to a given value of z, which let be L'z; then will the fluent of L'z contained between the given values of z be the surface required. If the solid be a cone generated by the rotation of a rectangular triangle round a side containing the right angle as an axis; hu will be a given quantity, if z be given. If the above-mentioned angles are given, but not right ones, the arc p'm and perpendicular l'h can easily be deduced, and consequently the increment of the surface. 3. To define a curve of double curvature, it is necessary to have two equations expressing the relation between the abscissae z and x and their ordinates (y) given, and if the angles which they respectively make with each other be right ones; the fluxion of the arc as given in the Proprietates Curvarum is (z2+x2+y2)1/2. Find its value from the two given equations in terms of x, y, or z, multiplied into its respective fluxions, and its fluent, properly corrected, will be the length of the arc required. If 196 Dr. WARING on the If the angles are not right, they may easily be reduced to them. 4. The attractions of these surfaces, curves, &c. on a given point P may be deduced from the preceding principles of finding the attractions of each of the parts in the directions of the first abscissa, which passes through the point P, the second abscissa, and the ordinates, and then finding the integrals of these increments. From the method which determines the attraction of a body, surface, &c. on a given point can be determined the attraction of a body, &c. on any number of points, and consequently the attraction of one body, &c. on another, &c. It is sometimes advantageous to transform the first absciss, that it may pass through the point attracted; and the abscissae and ordinates, that they may be at right angles to each other, &c. P R O B L E M V. 1. Fig. 8. Given an equation expressing the relation between the two abscissae AP and Pp of a solid, and their correspondent ordinates pm, or AP', P'p', and p'm'; to transform the first abscissa into any other Lh. Let the abscissa Lh begin from a point L of the first abscissa AP, and meet an ordinate pm in the point h; draw hp, and let the sines of the angles Ppm, Php, and pPh; LPh, PhL, and PLh, be denoted respectively by r, s, and t, &c. r', s', and t'; through a point h of the line Ph draw p'h'm' parallel to pm, and Lh=z, hh' = x, and h'm' = y: in the given equation for AP, Pp, and pm substitute respectively their correspondent Resolution of attractive Powers. 197 respondent values s'z/r'~AL (a), st'z/rr'~sx/r (for Ph = t'z/r' and Ph' = Ph~hh' = t'z/r/~x), and y~tt'z/rr'~tx/r'; there results an equation to the same solid expressing the relation between the two abscissae z=Lh and x, and their correspondent ordinates y. 1. 2. If the absciss Lh does not begin from L, a point in the first given absciss AP, but from M a point given out of it, it may be reduced to the preceding case, by drawing from M a line MN = c to the plane of the first and second abscissae parallel to the ordinates pm; and from N to the first abscissa a line NO = b parallel to the second abscissae, and substituting in the equation expressing the relation between AP, Pp, and pm for AP, Pp, and pm respectively z~AO (a), x~b and y~c; and there results the equation required expressing the relation between the two abscissae z and x, and their correspondent ordinates y, of which the first abscissa z passes through the point M. 2. To change the second abscissa Pp into any other Lh, the first abscissa and ordinates remaining the same. In the preceding figure let L be considered as a moveable point of the first absciss AL, and the sines of the respective angles denoted by the same letters as before, and Lh = x, AL=z, and hm = y; in the given equation for AP, Pp, and pm, substitute z ~ s'x/r', st'x/rr', and y~tt'x/rr'; and there will result the equation required expressing the relation between z and x the abscissae, and their correspondent ordinates y. 3. Fig 8. To change the ordinates, the abscissae remaining the same, draw p'm an ordinate transformed, p'h parallel to the first abscissa AP, and meeting a second abscissa, of which VOL. LXXIX. H h pm 198 Dr. WARING, &c. pm is an ordinate in h: for the sines of the angles p'hp, hpp', and hp'p; p'pm, pmp', and pp'm write r, s, and t, r', s', and t'; and for AP', P'p', and p'm respectively z, x, and y; then substitute in the given equation for AP, Pp, and pm, their respective values z (AP') ~ ss'/rr' X y, x (P'p' ~ ts'/rr' y, and t'/r' y; and there results an equation to the solid expressing the relation between the two abscissae AP' and P'p' and the transformed ordinates p'm. From these cases, which are easily reducible to one, may be transformed any given abscissae and their correspondent ordinates into any other containing given angles, &c. with the before-mentioned abscissae and ordinates. In the properties of curve lines, first published in 1762, is given a method of deducing the equation to any section of the solid, and in particular the case of deducing the equation to the projection of any curve on a given plane. From the principles given in this, and the Paper on centripetal forces, which the Royal Society did me the honour to print, can be deduced the fluxional equations, whose fluents express the relations between the abscissae and their correspondent ordinates of the curves described by bodies, of which the particles act on each other with forces varying according to given functions of their distances.
