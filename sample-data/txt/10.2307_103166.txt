(528) V. A Relation of the Effects of a Storm of Thunder and Lightning at Sampford-Courtney in Devonshire, or October the 7th 1711. Communicated by John Chamberlayne Esq; F. R. S. IN the Parish of Sampford-Courtney near Oakhampton in Devon, on the 7th of October, about 3 or 4 a Clock in the Afternoon, there was a great darkness as the Minister was Gatechising the Children, that he could hardly see with Spectacles: And as soon as Prayers were over, some young Men went to ringing, as commonly they used to do; and there were several People in the Church Porch talking; and of a sudden, a great FireBall fell in between them, and threw some one way, some another; but no one was hurted. The Ringers said, they never knew the Bells go so heavy in all their lives, and were forced to leave off: And being very weary, and looking out of the Belfrey into the Church, saw 4 Fire-Balls more, a little bigger than a Man's Fist, which of a sudden broke to pieces; so that the Church was full of Fire and Smoak. John Goodman's Man received a full Blow in the Neck, which caused him to bleed both at Nose and Mouth; but is very well now. He says, that the Fire and Smoak went up into the Tower, which broke a great Beam which one of the Bells hung on, and the Gudging breaking, the Bell fell on the Floor. It likewise carried away one of the Pinacles of the Tower next the Town, and threw some of the Stones near a Barn Door at a pretty distance from the Church, and hath done some Damage to the Barn at one end. The Chimney of the House was (529) was removed in such a manner by the Thunder and Lightning, that all People did admire it stood, and not fall upon the House. And tho' the People ran up and down in a great Consternation at the dreadful Thunder and Lightning, yet no body was hurt This Relation comes from the Minister who then officiated. VI.
