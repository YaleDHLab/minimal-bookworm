1281 3 XX. A formula for expressing the decrement of human lfe. In a letter addressed to Sir EDWARD HYDE EAST, Bart. M. P. F. R. S. By THOMAS YOUNG, M. D. For. Sec. R. S. Com.municated February 2, 1826. Read April 1i, 1826. MY DEAR SIR, THE investigation of the laws, by which the general mortality of the human species appears to be governed, is of equal importance to the statesman, the physician, the natural philosopher, and the mathematician; and as you have had occasion to pay particular attention to the subject, I trust that it will not be disagreeable to you to receive the results of an inquiry, into which I have entered, for the purpose of appree ciating, if not of reconciling, the many discordant opinions that have been advanced, respecting the comparative mortality of mankind, at different times, and under different circums stances. Of late years, there is little doubt, that, whether from the protective effects of vaccination in infancy, or from the iny crease of the comforts of the poorer, and of the temperance of the more affluent classes of society, or in some measure also from the simplification of the practice of physic and surgry, there is a decided increase in the mean duration of life in many parts of Europe: but it is also extremely probable that this improvement has been greatly exaggerated; partly on account of the limited description of the persons on whom 28o Dr. YouNG'sformulafor expressing the observations have been made, and partly from an erroneous opinion respecting the profits of certain establishments, which have been attributed to the employment of too low an estimate of mortality, while they have, in fact, been principally derived from the high rate of interest which the state of public credit has afforded. A very laborious and well informed actuary has lately asserted before a Committee of the House of Commons, that "the duration of existence now, compared with what it was a hundred years ago, is as four to three, in round numbers." (Parl. Rep. N. 522, p. 44.) It does indeed happen, that this particular result may in one sense be very correctly deduced from the immediate comparison of the annual mortality of a certain number of persons of the same description, that is, annuitants, at the periods in question; nor is it possible to deny that some importance must be attached to the remark: but the mortality of the same class of persons in France, at the earlier period, was no greater, according to Mr. DEPARCIEUX S estimate of their longevity, than in England at the later, while the general mortality in France has never been materially less than in England, and appears at present to be even somewhat greater: and it can only be conjectured, that the annuitants of the tontine of King WILLIAM were in general most injudiciously selected, while those who were the subjects of Mr. DEPARCIEUx's observations, like the annuitants of the modern tontines, were chosen with more care, or with greater success. Mr. FINLAISON'S tables, therefore, though they may be extremely just and valuable for the purpose of setting a price upon annuities to be granted on the lives of the proposers, cannot, with any prudence, be adopted where the decrement of human life. 283 the parties concerned have an interest in offering the worst lives that they can find notwithstanding any partial security that might be afforded by the exercise of medical skill in their rejection; and if it is true, that some of the tontines were principally filled by lot (Rep. p. 16), with the children of country clergymen and magistrates, it must still be supposed that the families of such persons may have been more healthy than the average of the population of London and the country taken together. For the comparison of the general characters of different tables of mortality, the simplest and most obvious criterion is perhaps the number of individuals out of which one dies annually, which is also the number of years expressing the expectation of life at the time of birth. But this test is liable to material objections with regard to the most usual appli-. cation of the table, which depends more on the comparative expectations at later periods than in early infancy. For example; the Northampton table affords results, throughout the whole of middle and advanced life, agreeing almost exactly with DEMOIVRE's hypothesis of equal decrements, although the annual mortality is supposed to be nearly 1 in 25 at Northampton, instead of 1 in 43, as assumed by DEMOIVRE. It would therefore be very unjust for a person allowing the truth of DEMOIVRE's hypothesis, to condemn the practical employment of Dr. PRICE's tables in common cases, on account of this variation only. A less exceptionable test will be, to find the mean of the numbers expressing, for different ages, the full term of life, or the sum of the age and twice the expectation, taking the decads from io to 8o as the most important. Another standard of comparison may be the age 284 Dr. YouNG's formula for expressing which is equal to the expectation of life, and which, in DEMOIVRE's arithmetical hypothesis, is the mean age of all the population, and probably very near it in all tables formed from actual observation. In this manner a general comparison of the most remarkable tables may be instituted. Characteristics of Mortality.

The proportion of Mr. FINLAISON'S tontines also stands as s to 4 in the first, and as 7 to 8, or 8 to 9 only in the second: the latter comparison giving a much fairer practical estimate of the comparative longevity, indicated by the tables, than the former. Another mode of easily appreciating the regularity and the analogies of different tables is, to construct a diagram, in the form of a curve, of which the absciss represents the age, and the ordinates the corresponding decrements of life. (Plate XI.) The inspection of such a diagram is sufficient to convince us of the great irregularity of the Carlisle tables of mortality, which must obviously have been formed, as they confessedly were, from observations on a very limited number of individuals, so that they exhibit a succession of different climacterics, after which the mortality is diminished, while about the age of 74 the curve that represents them towers to an incredible height, affording an expectation of longevity which some of the strongest advocates of those tables have aban.s doned in their practical applications, since they take their estimate of life, in advanced age, even lower than it is represented in the Northampton tables. It appears therefore to be highly probable, that the fairest basis for general computations, to be applied throughout Great Britain, may be obtained by a proper combination of the tables of Northampton, which have been long known and very generally approved, with the Carlisle tables, corrected however in their extravagant values of old lives, by some other documents; and with the mortality of London as MnDCCCXXVI. P p 286 Dr. YOUNG~'Sformula for expressing derived from the parish registers, which, when thus incorpo. rated with tables formed in the country, will be freed from the objections that have been made to the observations of burials in great cities only. The Carlisle table agrees in the earlier parts pretty nearly with the observations of Mr. MORGAN on the experience of the Equitable Office from 1768 to i8Xo, as it appears from Mr. MILNE'S comparison, as well as from the reduction and interpolation of those observations published by Mr. GOMPERTZ in the Philosophical Transactions for 1825: but for correcting the later portions of the Carlisle table, it may be allowable to employ a subsequent register of the experience of the Equitable Office, so far as it is possible to make any inferences from it with safety. The numbers of deaths occurring in to years, as recorded by Mr. MORGAN, might have been made the foundation of a very valuable determination of the mortality occurring in a certain class of persons, if the number of the Equitable Society had become stationary before the commencement of the record: but in order to deduce from it a just estimate of the value of life, it would then be necessary to alter the numbers of deaths at each age, in the inverse proportion of the numbers of the living compared: that is to say, not simply of the sums of the persons admitted under that age, but of the numbers of persons born whom they represent: since, in comparing the joint mortalities of any two lists of persons, we must obviously add together the deaths belonging, not to a given number of persons of various ages, but of a number proportionate to the survivors at the respective ages out of a given number of births, so that in this manner the apparent mortality in the the decrement of human life. 287 earlier portions of the register would require to be augmented, not only on account of the smaller number of persons who have actually contributed to furnish it, but also on account of the greater proportion that these persons bear to the corresponding number at birth, when compared with the survivors at more advanced ages, who represent a population still more exceeding their own numbers. On the other hand, since the register in question relates only to a limited number of years, immediately following a very rapid increase of the Society, it is evident that the deaths must have occurred at earlier ages than if it had been continued until all the lives had dropped. Of these three modifications, it may be sufficiently accurate for the present purpose to omit the two latter as nearly counterbalancing each other, and to augment the earlier numbers in the proportion only of the members of the Society to whom they must necessarily have belonged, supposing that the admissions had taken place about the same ages at all periods assuming also the number of survivors at 45 to be in the same proportion to the births as in the Carlisle table. We may then proceed to take a mean between the mortality thus obtained, with proper interpolations, and the observations at Carlisle, as the second of the three principal bases to be afterwards incorporated with the mortality of Northampton and of London. Further than this, it is impossible to place any great reliance on Mr. MORGANS document, which makes the annual deaths, in "s a population exceeding ioooo," not quite 1 in 1500. Of the mortality of London, taken for the ten years from i8ii to 1820, it may be observed, that its results bear the 2:88 Dr. YOUNG's formula for expressing internal evidence of greater apparent correctness than either of the other bases, exhibiting a curve less irregular in its flexures, and generally intermediate between the others it has also the advantage of exhibitingthe duration of life as prolonged by the general introduction of vaccination: and when thus incorporated with the registers of two places in the country, each reduced to an equal supposed population, it must probably be sufficiently corrected for the errors that may be attributed to the effect of an afflux of settlers at an early age. The mean obtained in this manner might be employed at once as a standard table without much inconvenience, but it still exhibits some minute but obvious irregularities, as an inspection of the line of stars in the diagram will show, principally perhaps from the want of skill or care with which the interpolations have been made-by Dr. PRICE and others. The most effectual of all interpolations for harmonizing the various orders of differences, is to obtain a formula which shall extend with sufficient accuracy throughout the whole curve. It may be easily believed that it must be extremely difficult to find such an expression; and that its form must be too complicated to be applied to any practical purpose throughout its extent. I have however drawn a curve which comes extremely near to the line of stars, and crosses it in io or 12different points, by means of the equation y=368 +lox. 1oX-1.(156+ 2Ox-Xx) + 6 285 + 2 0o5 x x+z(j -55 '(X) + 4 X\20 5 (00 l ) : Y being the number of deaths among 0ooooo persons, in the year that completes the age x. the decrement of human; life. 289 The terms of this formula have some remarkable relations to the different periods of life. HALLEY'S first approximation was y =ooo, throughout life. DEMOIVRE's arithmetical hy10000o prsn pothesis was y.-.?1? 1163: but of the present formula the principal foundation, as extending to the whole of life, is, y =368 + lo x. In infancy the term containing the reciprocal of the powers of x has a preponderating value: in youth, the term (156 + 20 X xx)2, which diminishes the mortality, ends somewhat abruptly at 2, and would be incapable of being employed with safety in algebraical calculations, from its having a negative as well as a positive value. Old age is expressed almost exclusively by the high powers at the end of the formula, which terminate the series with great and increasing rapidity. It is obvious that for many purposes of calculation, the terms belonging to youth and to old age might be neglected without inconvenience, and that, for the middle portion of life, the terms 368 + lo alone, with some little modification, night be employed as sufficiently correct; or certainly as much nearer to the truth than either the arithmetical or geometrical hypothesis of DEMOIVRE. The relations of the different parts of the formula will be best appreciated from their developement in the following tables. 290 D~r. YOUNG'S formulafor expressing DOCUMENTS.

The error has indeed of late 298 Dr. YouNG's formulafor expressing years been very commonly admitted; but its effects have not been so satisfactorily rectified as could be desired. In the 66th volume of the Philosophical Transactions, for the year 1776, we find a Paper of Dr. PRicE, in which he lays down these theorems, r denoting the interest of Li. for a year, and n the term or number of years during which any annuity will be paid, p the perpetuity, or I , y the value of an r annuity paid yearly, and h half yearly: then, I,y=p r ( + a)"; and, II,h -ps_ : and as examples taking r .=04, r(z +Lf and n= , we havey4,.4,58, andp=4.4913. Now, if we analyse the results thus obtained, by dividing them into the present values of the separate payments,: they will stand thus: I. Present value of Li. payable at the end of} ? 658 1 year.~ 92 years .924556 3 years .888996 4 years .854804 s years .821927 4.451821 II.

The difficulty, if any person thinks it such, may be avoided by a mode of investigation which I have lately had occasion to point out. "c An annuity, of which a payment is due on a given day, is more valuable than an annuity purchased on that day, andto commence a year after, by the amount of a year's payment: and the value of a life annuity, becoming payable at any intermediate time between the day of purchase and its first anniversary, will be greater than the simple tabular value of the annuity by a sum proportional to the anticzpation of the payment ;" the increase of the value being very nearly uniform, when we supposethe anticipation to bee gradually increased:this increase of the value comprehending obviously the greater probability as well as the greater proximity of each payment, and proceeding from day to day by very nearly equal increments. Thus, if we wished to purchase an 300 )Dr. YOUNG'S formula for expressing annuity of Lioo. a year, and its value were ?iooo., upon the ordinary supposition of the payments commencing after the end of a year; supposing that we desired to have the first payment made at the end of nine months, and the subsequent payments at annual intervals as usual, we should have to add ?25 to the purchase money, making it ?1025. at whatever rate of interest the value might have been computed. If we began at six months, ?5o., and if at three months, ? 75. must be' added to the purchase : it being obvious that an additional ?ioo. would be equivalent to an anticipation of twelve months, or to an immediate payment of a year's annuity. From this simple and incontestable principle, in which the second differences only are neglected, it is very easy to deduce the values of annuities, payable at intervals shorter thani a year. An annuity of i, payable half yearly, is equal to two annuities of the one beginning as usual at the end of the year, the other anticipated by half a year; and the value of this portion is greater than the other by half of one of the payments, that is, by o: SO that " We may always find the value of a life annuity payable half yearly, by adding a quarter of a year to the tabular value of the same annuity." In a similar manner it is very easily shown, that "for quarterly payments, we must add -8 of a year's value to the comput ation made on the supposition of annual payments;" and "the continual bisection -of the interval would at last afford as the addition of half a yearly payment for the value of a daily or hourly payment of a proportional part of the given annuity.' "It may also be observed, that when we reckon at s per the decrement of human life. 301 cent. interest, an annuity payable half yearly is the same, throughout the middle of life, that would be granted on the life of a person a year older, if payable annually." If it is required to ascertain the value of a reversionary annuity payable half yearly or quarterly, the calculation becomes in appearance a little paradoxical for since the true value of a reversionary annuity for the life of one person, for example, after the death of another, is the difference between the values of two annuities on the single life and the joint lives, and since an equal addition must be made to these values in consideration of the period of payment being shortened, it follows that the reversionary annuity must be of equal value in either form. This conclusion would indeed be strictly true if the periodical times of payment remained unaltered according to the supposition from which the value of the annuities is deduced; while in fact it is usual to grant such an annuity to commence at the first quarterly, half yearly, or annual period after the contingent event: a variation which would -have no sensible effect in the case of daily payments, but which lessens the value of reversionary annuities at other periods byT that of half a payment for the given period, reduced to the present time in the same manner as any other sum assured as payable upon the same contingency of survivorship. The simplicity observable in the progression of the values of annuities, calculated according to the values of lives here supposed, and at 3 per cent. interest, leads us to inquire what would be the exact law of mortality required to make that progression strictly uniform throughout life; and it will appear on investigation, that in order to have the value 24.45 -. x, MDCCCXXVI. R r 302 Dr. YOUNG'S formula for expressing x being the age of the person, which is nearly true between 2o and 70, the annual mortality must be expressed by .03 + .066: a fraction which at 2o becomes 1 . at 40, 2... at 100.8 x 48' 60,o-, and at So, 2-4.

The curve marked by obelisks, +, in the diagram, will show the comparative progress of mortality iin this system; which, however valuable the data may be, appears to exhibit too many novelties, if not anomalies, to be generally adopted vith confidence: while the line of crosses, X, representing the tontine of DEPARciEux, will serve to show how little difference the lapse of a century has made in the results of these two similar cases. I shall conclude, my dear Sir, with a comparison of the climacteric years, as they may be called without impropriety, in which the greatest numbers of adults die, as taken from different tables. I sincerely hope that these considerations may help to undeceive the too credulous public, who have of late not only received some hints that tend to insinuate the probability of an occasional recurrence of a patriarchal longevity, but who have been required to believe, upon the authority of a most respectable mathematician, that the true and unerring value the decrement of human 4fe. 303 of life is not to be ,obtained by taking an average of various decrements, but by adopting the extreme of all conceivable estimates, founded only on a hasty assertion of Mr. MORGAN, and unsupported by any detailed report; an estimate which makes the grand climacteric of mankind in this country, not a paltry fifty four, or the too much dreaded sixty three; but no less than EIGHTY TWO! An age to which nearly one sixth of the survivors at ten are supposed to attain! Climacterics, or greatest Decrements.
