Remarks on the Height of Mountains in general, and of those of Swisserland in particular, with an Account of the Rise of some of the most considerable Rivers of Europe. By J. G. Scheuchzer, M. D. &c. IN a former Paper, I took Notice that Dicaearchus found Mount Pelius in Thessalia, to be 1250 Paces high, which make 6250 Roman, or 6822 Paris Feet, a Height which we may well pronounce too great even for the absolute Height of Mount Pelius, I mean its Rise above the Level of the Sea. Conform to the Determination of Dicaearchus, I mentioned, that Plutarch fixes the Height of the highest Mountains, and the greatest Depth of the Sea to 10 Stadia, and Cleomedes affirms, that they cannot exceed 16 Stadia. The celebrated Galileus de Galileis is one of the most modest among the modern Writers on this Head: For he says, * that the highest Mountains do not rise above a Mile, or 8 Stadia, or 5000 old Roman Vespasian Feet, which make 5458 Paris Feet above the Level of the Sea, which we shall find by and by to agree pretty well with some of the highest Mountains in France, and may conjecture to do so with those in Italy. Kepler went rather too far ~ when he assigned the Mountains of Rhaetia (thought the highest in Swisserland) a Height of 26 Stadia, or 10000 old Roman Vespasian Feet, which make 10916 Paris Feet. The Opinions of some other antient and modern Geographers and Mathematicians, will appear better by the Table annexed. * Nuntius Sidereus, p. 14. ~ Astronom. Optic. p. 129, 135. & Epitom.

VI.) is of Opinion, in Pursuance of what he imagines to have demonstrated of the Mountains A512 320000 349312 thos and Caucasus, that possibly there may be Mountains of Now, (579) Now, in Opposition to this Table, wherein the Heights must needs, upon first View, appear romantick and unnatural, let us consider the Height of such Mountains, as have been measured,either by Trigonometrical or Barometrical Observations. In England, the Height of Snowdon-hill, one of the highest Mountains in Wales, was measured Trigonometrically, by Mr. J. Caswell of Oxford, and found to be of 1240 Yards, or 3720 English Feet, which make 3488 Paris Feet. At the Top of this Mountain, the Mercury subsided to 25~ 6~, which being reduced to Paris Measure, make just 24~. Now in the Tables above, the Height of the Place where the Mercury subsides to 24~, is, according to Mariotte, of 544 Toises, two Foot, or 3266 Foot above the Level of the Sea, according to Cassini, 676 Toises, or 4056 Feet, and according to my Uncle's Calculation 559~ 2~, or 3356~, so that Mariotte comes 222 Feet short of its Height, as it was determined Trigonometrically, Dr. Scheuchzer but 132~, but Cassini exceeds this Height by 568 Feet, which confirms again, as I have shewn in a former Paper, that the Mariottian Table is preferable to that of Cassini, though pretended to have been corrected upon the former, and that that of Dr. Scheuchzer is an Improvement upon both. According to the Observation made by Dr. Halley, May 26, 1697, the Mercury stood at the Top of, Snowden-hill, at 26~ 1~ English, which, if reduced as above, would give the Height of the Mountain something less. In France, when the Meridian Line, first begun in 1669, was continued in 1703, the Heights of several Mountains, particularly in the South of France, were determined Trigonometrically by the Members of the H h h h 2 Royal (580) Royal Academy of Sciences: And I find up and down in their Memoirs, the Heights of the following.

Barthelemy dans le paix 1185 7110 de foix La Montagne du Mousset 1258 7548 Le Canigou 1440 8640 Before I proceed farther, I must beg Leave to observe, that the Heights of these Mountains, in the main, seem rather too great. This indeed is easily accounted for, as they were measured by Trigonometrical Observations, which will, as I have took Notice above, because of the Re(581) Refraction of the Air, give the Heights greater than they actually are. But what confirms it still more, is, that according to the Tables above, the Numbers which answer to the Heights of the Mercury, as they were observed at the Top of some of those Mountains, are considerably less, and that even Mons. Cassini's own Numbers, which yet we have by some undoubted Experiments shewn to be too great, fall often short. It will be enough to mention two or three Instances. At the Tower of Massane in Roussillon,the Mercury stood at 25~ 5~, and the Height of that Place was determined trigonometrically, of 397 Toises. Now 25~ 5~ answer according 342 0 Mariotte, to According to Cassini, 392 4 According to Dr. Scheuchzer 350 0 At the Top of the Mountain called la Coste in Auvergne, the Mercury stood, Oct. 9, 1700, at 23~ 4~, and the Height of this Mountain was determined Trigonometrically of 851~ Toises.

Sebastien Truchet, June 8, 1705, to 22~ 11~, which answer according to Mariotte, to 707~ 5~ 332~ 1~ Cassini to 925 1 differ. 114 5 Dr. Scheuchzer 727 3 312 3 I come now to the Mountains of Swisserland. The Barometrical Observations made by my Father upon several of the highest will convince us, that they rise aloft, above all the neighbouring ones in France,Spain, Italy and Germany. And that it must be so appears farther, because from their elevated Tops, they dispense their Waters to all the European Kingdoms and Provinces around them. Nay, I doubt not, but that they may vye in Height with the most considerable Mountains in any other Part of the known Globe. Swisserland it self, I mean its Valleys and lower Parts, as they are considerably remote from the Sea, rise also in Proportion above the Level of it. 'Tis true, the Ascent thither is but gradual, in Proportion to the Remoteness. At Zuric, for Instance, which lies towards the Northern Borders of Swisserland, the mean Height of the Barometer hath been observed of 26~ 5~, which give the Elevation of that Town, above the Level of the Sea, according to Mariotte, 205 Toises, 4 Foot, or 1234~, according to Dr. Scheuchzer, 210~ 4~, or 1264~, and according to Cassini, 221~ 4~, or 1330~. This Town is distant from the Mouth of the Rhine, which is the nearest Part of the Ocean, at least 375 English Miles, or an hundred marine French Leagues, and from Genoa which is nearest upon the Mediterranean, 225 En~ glish (583) glish Miles, or 62 French marine Leagues. So that going down from Zuric Northwards towards the Sea, the Descent, or Fall, is but something more than 12 Foot, for a marine League of France, if we suppose a streight Line to be drawn from Zuric to the Sea-shore in Holland; but it is much greater going Southward towards the Mediterranean, where it comes at least to 20 Foot for one League. Nay, if we consider that the highest Mountains of Swisserland lie almost directly between Zuric and the Mediterranean Shores, we must allow so much more in Proportion, as those Mountains are elevated above the Horizon of Zuric, and how great and sudden this Elevation be, will appear by the following Observations. At Ennen Sewen gen Aweren in the Ascent of the high Mountain Freyberg, in the Canton of Glarus, which lies South East of Zuric, the Mercury was observed Sept. 11, 1710, at 23'' 10'', which gives the Height of that Place above the Level of the Sea, according to Mariotte 569o 2' or 3416' Dr. Scheuchzer 584 4 3508 Cassini 712 3 4275 Upon Scherf, one of the Branches of the Freyberg, the Mercury fell Sept. 12, 1710, to 2''8''', which gives the Height of that Part of the Mountain according to Mariotte 906o 1' or 5437' Dr. Scheuchzer 931 2 or 5588 Cassini 1247 4 or 7486 Still (584) Still higher upon Blattenstock, another Part of the same Mountain, the Mercury fell on the same Day to 21'' 6''', which answer according to Mariotte, to 933o 2' or 5600' Dr. Scheuchzer 959 2 or 5756 Cassini 1293 3 or 7761 Hence from Zuric to the Blattenstock near the Top of the Freyberg, there is, in less than three Days Journey, a Rise of 4366 Feet, according to Mariotte, and 4492, according to Dr. Scheuchzer, that is, more than three times the Elevation of Zuric above the Level of the Sea. At Guppen ob Schwanden, in the same Canton of Glarus, the Mercury was observed, August 5, 1705, at 23'' 4''', which give, according to Mariotte 644o 1' or 3865' Dr. Scheuchzer 661 5 or 3971 (I omit giving the Numbers according to the Tables of Mr. Cassini, having already shewn, that they are too great) The Height of this Mountain is nearly the same with the celebrated Puy de Domme, where Mons. Perier observed the Mercury, Sept. 19, 1648, at 23'' 2'''. Upon Joch, a high Mountain in the Territory of Engelberg, where it confines upon the Canton of Bern, full South of Zuric, the Mercury stood, June 23, 1706, at 21'' 4''', which gives the Height of that Mountain according to Mariotte 961o 0' or 5766 Dr. Sheuchzer, 987 4 or 5926 This Mountain, though very high, is far from being the highest in that Neighbourhood, for next to it there (585) there rises another called the Titlisberg, covered with everlasting Snow, which we may, upon a moderate Computation, pronounce at least 1000 Foot higher that the Top of the Joch, and consequently one of the highest in the Country. Upon the Avicula, by the Italians called Monte del' Uccello, and by some S. Bernhard's Mountain, from a Chappel built in Honour of that Saint, a high Mountain in Rhaetia, towards Italy, the Mercury was observed, July 30, 1707, at 22'' 11''', which give according to Mariotte 707o 5' or 4247' Dr. Scheuchzer 727 3 4365 This Height must be understood only of that Part of the Mountain which is passed over by Travellers, the Mountain it self rising considerably above it, and the Adula, or ~ of Strabo, Geog. L. III. of which the Avicula is only a Part, being still higher. The Rhenus posterior, or Hinder Rhein, and the Mouss, which at last loses itself into the Tesin, near Bellinzone, not much above the Entry of the Tesin into the Lake of Locarno, arise upon this Mountain. At Santa Maria, upon the Luckmannier Berg, by some S. Barnaby's Mountain, which is likewise a Branch of the Adula, the Mercury stood,Aug. 9, 1725, as upon the Avicula, at 22'' 11''', which shews the Height of these two Places to be equal. In the Alp San Porta,near the Source of the Hinter Rhein, Rhenus posterior, five Hours and a half from Speluga, Spliigen in Rhaetia, the Mercury was observed, July 29, 1707, at 21'' 4''', where it stood likewise upon the above-mentioned Mountain Joch, whither the Reader is referred for the Height of this Alp. I i i i At (586) At Splugen itself, the Mercury stood the same Morning early, at 23'' 4''', which give the Elevation of Splugen according to Mariotte 644o 1' or 3865, and according to Dr. Scheuchzer, 661o 5' or 3971'. So that the Fall of the Rhine from the Alp aforesaid to Splugen, in five Hours and a half, comes, according to Mariotte, to 1901, and according to Dr. Scheuchzer, to 1955 Paris Feet perpendicular. At the Capuchins, upon the high Mountain S. Gothard, a celebrated Passage out of Swisserland into Italy, the Mercury stood, June 30, 1705, at 22'' 0, which gives the Height of that Passage, which with Regard to the highest Tops of S. Gothard, lies but as it were at the Foot of a high Mountain, according to Mariotte 852o, or 5112', and according to Dr. Scheuchzer, 875o 5', or 5255, above the Level of the Sea. Upon the Furca, a high Mountain between the Urseren Thal, Ursaria Vallis, and the upper Vallesia, and one of the Branches of the S. Gothard, the Height of the Mercury in the Barometer was observed, July, 31, 1707, at 21'' 5''', which give the Height of this Mountain above the Level of the Sea, according to Mariotte, 947o 1' or 5683', and according to Dr. Scheuchzer, 973o 3' or 5841. Near this Mountain there are others, which cannot be less than 800 or 900 Foot higher. These Mountains, I mean the Avicula, the Luckmannier Berg, the S. Gothard, and the Furca, together with the Grimsula, the Crispalt, the Sempronier, or Sempronius Mons, the Adula, and a Chain of others, are the Lepontiae Alpes of Pliny * and the Summae * Lib. iii. c. xx. Alpes (587) Alpes of Caesar *. They begin in the upper Vallesia, traverse the Canton of Uri, and so run on Eastwards, a-cross the Country of the Grisoons, towards Tirol. Their greatest Height above the Level of the Sea, may be fixed in round Numbers to 7500, or 8000 Paris Feet. 'Tis upon these very Mountains, that some of the most considerable Rivers of Europe take their first Rise, within very small Distances of each other. The Rhosne, for Instance, Rhodanus, by Marcellinus called, maximi nominis flumen, and by Varro, Fluvins inter tres Europae maximus, arises from two Gletchers, as we call them, or Montes glaciales, huge Mountains of Ice, near the Furca, whose Height hath been above determined, and thence runs with great Impetuosity down Vallesia, the Wallisserland, forming a long Valley, surrounded on both Sides with huge Mountains, till it looses its Waters and Name in the Lacus Lemannus, or Lake of Geneva, but resumes it again near the Town of Geneva, whence it flows with a more gentle Descent through some Provinces of France into the Mediterranean Sea. The Thesin, Ticinus, by Claudian, in his Panegyric upon the Consulate of the Emperor Honorius, called Pulcher, the handsom; takes its first Rise from two small Lakes upon the S. Gothard, and some lateral Sources from the Lago sopra la Cima di Pettine, upon a Mountain called Pettine, the Lago della Sella, the Lake of Rottom upon the Luckmannier Berg, the Lake of Tom, and the Lake of Bedretto,upon a Mountain of this Name. It descends the Lavinia Vallis, or Liviner Valley, and in its Way to the Lake of * De Bello Gallico l. iii. I i i i 2 Lo(588) Locarno, receives many Brooks and Rivulets from the adjoining Mountains: It unites its Waters with the Po, near Pavia, and looses itself jointly with that River into the Adriatick Gulf. The Rhine, Rhenus, by Caesar de Bello Gallico termed, latissimus atque altissimus, arises in three several Branches, which are called Rhenus anterior, posterior, & medius, the further, the hinder, and middle Rhine. The hinder Rhine takes its Rise upon the high Mountain Avicula, Colmen del Occello, Part of the Adula, in the Alp San Porta, from a Gletcher, or Ice-mountain, which extends in Length full two Hours. The middle Rhine, Rhenus medius, arises upon the Luckmannier Berg, which is likewise Part of the Adula, in the upper Part of a Valley called San Maria, opposite to one of the Sources of the Thesin. The furthermost Rhine, Rhenus anterior, arises upon that Branch of the Crispalt, which is called Cima del Badut, Baduz, and soon receives several lateral Branches from the Alps Mugels and Cornera. My present Purpose will not suffer me to pursue the Course of this River in its several Branches. Near the Monastery of Disentis, the further and middle Rhine join together, and the united Stream falls into the hinder Rhine, near Reichenau. Below Rheineck, The Rhine falls into the Lacus Bodamicus, or Boden Sea, and comes out of it near Stein; whence washing for sometime the Borders of Swisserland, it then traverses great Part of Germany in a very irregular Course, till at last, in Holland, it looses itself into the great Ocean. The Reuss, Rusa, arises from a small Lake called Lago di Luzendro, upon the S. Gothard, but soon receives a considerable Inforcement from the Furca, and (589) and near Urselen, another from a mountainous Lake in Oberalp. Near Fluelen, not far from Ury, it enters the IV. Waldstetten Sea, Lacus quatuor Civitatum Sylvestrium, but resumes its Course and Name at Lucern, and at last falls into the Aar below Windish, Vindonissa. The Aar, Arola, Arula, arises upon the high Mountain Grimsula, in the upper Vallesia. About three Hours below that, it falls into the Lake of Brientz, and out of that, not far from the Monastery Interlachen, into the Lake of Thun, which it leaves near the Town of Thun, and thence running by Bern, Solothurn, and so down, falls at last, after many Windings and Turnings into the Rhine near Coblentz, Confluentia, probably so called from the uniting of these two considerable Rivers. But to proceed. Gemmius Mons, the Gemmi, is a very high and steep Mountain in Vallesia, over which there is a Passage, but only in Summer-time, from the Fruttinger Valley, in the Canton of Bern, to the Mineral Waters at Leuk in Vallesia. The Descent, on the South-side of this Mountain, is steep and frightful, even to the Aspect, beyond what can be imagined, being a narrow Path, cut on the Side of almost perpendicular Precipices, sometimes with trembling woodenBridges,or Planks over the Clefts in the Mountain, and here and there supported with low Walls. Having been geometrically measured, it was found of 10110 Feet in Length, or rather Height, its many Windings and Turnings included. At a small Cottage, called Zur Dauben, a poor resting Place for weary Travellers, being the highest Part of the Mountain which is passable, the Mercury subsided July 1, 1709, to 21~ 3~ which gives the Height of (590) of that Place, according to Mariotte 974~ 5~ or 5849~ And Dr. Scheuchzer 1002 0 or 6012 Not far from this Cottage, is a small mountainous Lake, called the Dauben Sea, or the Pidgeons Lake, encompassed on all Sides with high Mountains, the Tops whereof, for their Steepness, it would be impossible to reach. At Kandelstag, the first Village in the Frutinger Valley, in the Territory of Bern, going up to the Gemmi, the Mercury rose on the same Day to 24~ 2~, which give according to Mariotte 520~ 1~ or 3121~ Dr. Scheuchzer 534 1 or 3205 And at Mullenen, at the Foot of the Gemmi, it stood at 25~ 7~, which answer according to Mariotte to 318~ 5~ or 1913~ Dr. Sheuchzer 327 0 or 1962 On the other Side of the Gemni, at Leuck, a celebrated Place for its Mineral Waters,the Mercury was observed July 2, and July 5, 1709, at 23~ 9~, which answers according to Mariotte, to 581~ 4~, or 3490~, and according to Dr. Sheuchzer, to 597~ 3~, or 3585~. So that the Cottage Zur Dauben, rises above Leuck, according to Mariotte, 2359~ Dr. Scheuchzer 2427 Above Mullenen, in the Frutinger Valley, according to Mariotte 3936~ Dr. Scheuchzer 4050 And (591) And the perpendicular Height of the Gemmi, above the Level of the Sea, considerably exceeds 6000 Paris Feet. But high above all the Mountains of Swisserland rises the Stella, Piz Stail, a steep Mountain in the Schamser Valley, in Rhaetia,or the Grisoons, the Height whereof was by my Uncle Dr. John Scheuchzer, by some Observations made in the Year 1709, determined to 9585 Paris Foot, above the Level of the Sea, according to his own Calculation, or 9441 according to Mariotte, and 12196 according to Cassini: A Height, which the Rupicaprae, or Shamoys themselves scarce venture to ascend. And 'tis to these only, and the like Heights the following Verses of Silius Italicus ought to be applied. Cuncta gelu, canaque aeternum grandine tecta, Atque aevi glaciem cohibent: riget ardua montis AEtherei facies, surgentique obvia Phaebo Duratas nescit flammis mollire Pruinas. Nullum ver usquam, nullique aestatis honores, Sola jugis habitat diris, sedesque tuetur Perpetuas deformis hyems Having thus determined the Heights of the Mountains of Swisserland from Barometrical Observations, I will now close these Remarks, which are insensibly grown to a much greater Length, than I at first intended they should, with a few general Observations on the natural History of that Country, arising from the Height of its Mountains. The first Observation shall regard the Lakes, of which there are several, and very remarkable ones, in and (592) and upon the Borders of Swisserland, which will afford me a singular Instance of Divine Providence. The Ascent of the Mountains of Swisserland being so very sudden and quick, that as I have above shewn, the Elevation of the Mountains in the Canton of Glarus above the Horizon of Zuric, though not quite three Days distant, is more than three Times as great, as the Elevation of Zuric itself above the Level of the Ocean, of which it is upwards of 375 English Miles distant in a streight Line; and so in Proportion of others; and the Rivers, which arise in these Mountains, rushing down, in Consequence of so quick a Descent, with great Force and Impetuosity, it was to be feared, they would often overflow their Banks, and cause frequent Inundations in the flat Countries, (of which there are too many Instances in our own Vallies and Plains,) if this Force and Impetuosity was not in great Measure broke, and their Waters disposed to a more gentle Descent. And this is effectually done by those great Receptacles of Water, the Lakes, which are besides of infinite Use to the Inhabitants around them, supplying them with Plenty of Fish for their Sustenance, and enriching them by the Facility with which Commerce may be carried on over them. Thus the Rhine falls into the Lacus Bodamicus, Boden-Sea, the Rhosne into the Lacus Lemannus, or Lake of Geneva, the Muesa and Thesin into the Lake of Locarno, the Reus into the Lake of Lucern, the Adda and Maira into the Lake of Como, the Lint, or Limat, into the Lake of Zuric, the Aar, into the Lakes of Brientz and Thun. And it seems, that the more considerable the Rivers are, and the more impetuous their Course, so much the greater must the Receptacles be, wherein they are to loose their Force (593) Force and Rapidity. The Lake of Geneva, and the Boden-Sea, the two largest in Swisserland, evidently evince what I here assert, and the others above-named gradually decrease in Largeness, in proportion as the Rivers, which fall into them, are less and less rapid. The extream Smallness of the Alpine Plants is another Observation, I intend to make. They become less and less, in proportion as the Mountains, upon which they grow, rise higher. Whether this be owing to the Sharpness and Purity of the Alpine Air, or the decreasing Pressure of the Atmosphere, which is far less upon Mountains than in Valleys and lower Countries, or to a Want of a sufficient Quantity of subterraneous Heat, to push the Nourishment into the Roots and Vessels of the Plants, or rather to a joint Concurrence of these and other Causes, would require a more leisurely Consideration. The Thing itself is an indisputable Matter of Fact, and it extends also to Trees and Shrubs, which become smaller, as they grow higher. Nay, what is still more remarkable, no Trees will grow beyond a certain Height, which is the Reason why the Tops of Mountains appear so bare and naked, if viewed at a Distance, though a curious Traveller shall not fail meeting upon their rich Pastures with an agreeable Variety of beautiful Plants. The Height, where the Trees cease to grow, hath been found, by Barometrical Observations, nearly to be the same in divers Parts of Swisserland. Otherwise, the Smallness of the Alpine Plants is abundantly compensated by the Richness of their Virtues, which are, as it were, purposely centred there into so narrow a Compass. But to another Observation. The Mountains are much more abrupt, and steep, and the Precipices greater K k k k to (594) to the South, than to the North, and Westwards than Eastwards. Many Instances of this might be given in particular Mountains in Swisserland, as the Gemmi, the Mons fractus and so forth; but it is also evidently true with Regard to the whole. Those are the highest Mountains, which separate Vallesia, the Canton of Uri, and the several Leagues of the Grisons, from Savoy, Piemont, and the Tirol, which lie to the South, or South-East. Those very Countries are, as it were, one continued Set of high Mountains, quite to the Mediterranean Sea, and the like Structure seems to be continued farther on into that Sea itself. The Pyrenean Mountains also are but a Continuation of that vast Chain, which begins in the Lepontiae Alpes, or the Mountains in the upper Vallesia, the Canton of Ury and Rhaetia, and from thence spreads itself chiefly West and South. On the contrary to the East and North they break off by Degrees into gentle Plains, which appears evidently by the vast Tracts of Ground, which the Rhine for Instance, and the Danube compass, before they lose themselves, the one into the German Ocean, the other into the black Sea, whereas the Rhosne, on the other Side, quickly and with a proportionable Velocity reaches the Mediterranean. The same Observation, with Regard to the abrupt Steepness of Mountains to the South and West, holds true in other Parts of Europe, remarkably in England and Norway, more or less in other Countries. And so far as our Maps, and the Accounts of Travellers go, the same Thing is observable in other Parts of the World, but most evidently in the high Mountains of Peru and Chili in South America, which terminate very abruptly Westwards into the Pacifick Sea, but gradually decline to
