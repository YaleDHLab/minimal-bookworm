Extract of a Letter from Mr. Edmund Pitt, Alderman of Worcester, a very knowing Botanist; concerning the Sorbus Pyriformis. LAst year I found a Rarity growing wild in a Forest of this County of Worcester. It is described by L'Obelius under the name of Sorbus Pyriformis: as also by Mathiolus upon Dioscorides. And by Bauhimus, under the name of Sorbus Procera. And they agree, that in France, Germany, and Italy they are commonly found. But neither These, nor any of our own Country-men, as Gerard, Parkinson, Johnson, How, nor those Learned Authors Merret or Ray, have taken notice of its being a Native of England. Nor have any of our English Writers so much as mention'd it. Saving, that Mr. Lyte, in his Translation of Dodonaeus, describes it under the name of the Sorb-Apple. But saith no more of the place, but that it groweth in DutchLand. It (979) It resembles the Ornus or Quicken Tree; only the Ornus bears the Flowers and Fruit at the end, This, on the sides of the Branch. Next the Sun, the Fruit hath a dark-red blush: and is about the bigness of a small Juneting Pear. In September, so rough, as to be ready to strangle one. But being then gather'd, and kept till October, they eat as well as any Medlar. Thus far the Letter. Q. Whether a Verjuyce made of this Fruit, either ground with Crabs, or Grapes, or if plentiful, alone, would not, being kept for some time, prove one of the best acid-astringent Sawces, that Nature affords.
