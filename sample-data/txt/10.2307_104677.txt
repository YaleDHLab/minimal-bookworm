X. Extract of Letter from Mr. William Arderon F. R. S. to Mr. Henry Baker F. R. S. containing an Account of a Dwarf; together with a Comparison of his Dimensions with those of a Child under four Years old; by David Erskine Baker. Norwich, May 12, 1750. `` JOHN Coan, a Dwarf, was born at `` Twitshall in Norfolk, in the Year `` 1728, and has been shewn in this City for some `` Weeks past. I weigh'd him myself Apr. 3, 1750, and `` his Weight, with all his Cloaths, was no more than `` 34 Pounds. I likewise carefully measured him, and O o o `` found Read June 14. 1750. [468] `` found his Height, with his Hat, Shoes, and Wig `` on, to be 38 Inches. His Limbs are no bigger `` than a Child of 3 or 4 Years old: His Body is per`` fectly strait: The Lineaments of his Face answer`` able to his Age; and his Brow has some Wrinkles `` in it, when he looks attentively at any thing. `` He has a good Complexion, is of a sprightly Tem`` per, discourses readily and pertinently considering `` his Education, and reads and writes English well. `` His Speech is a little hollow, tho' not disagreeable; `` he can sing tolerably, and amuses the Company `` that come to see him, with mimicking a Cock's `` Crowing, which he imitates very exactly. In `` 1744 he was 36 Inches high, and weigh'd 27 `` Pounds and an half. His Father says, when about `` a Year old he was as large as Children of that Age `` usually are, but grew very little and slowly after`` wards.'' On receiving the Account of this little Man, a Child of 3 Years and not quite nine Months old, Son of the late very worthy William Jones Esq; F. R. S. was measured and weighed. This Boy, tho' very lively and handsome, is no way remarkaable for his Size; and therefore his Dimensions and Weight, compared with the Dwarf's, may give a tolerable Idea of the real Smallness of the Dwarf. The Weight of the Dwarf, with all his Cloaths on, was no more than 34 Pounds. The Child's Weight, with its Cloaths likewise on, was 36 Pounds (a). The (a) The Cloaths, being weigh'd afterwards by themselves, were two [469] Inches. The Height of the Dwarf, with his Shoes, Hat and Wig on 385/10 The Height of the Child, without any thing on his Head 377/10 Dwarf. Child. Inches Inches Round the Waist 21 205/10 Round the Neck 9 97/10 Round the Calf of the Leg 8 9 Round the Ancle 6 6 Round the Wrist 4 41/10 Round the Thumb 2 21/10 Length of the Arm, viz. from the Shoulder to the Wrist 15 13 From the Elbow to the End of the middle Finger 104/10 10 From the Wrist to the End of the middle Finger 4 4 From the Knee to the Bottom of the Heel 104/10 107/10 Length of the Foot with the Shoe on 6 64/10 Length of the Face 6 62/10 Breadth of the Face 5 48/10 Length of the Nose 12/10 12/10 Width of the Mouth 18/10 18/10 Breadth of the Hand 25/10 25/10 It two Pounds fourteen Ounces; consequently the real Weight of the Child is thirty-three Pounds two Ounces; which is but fourteen Ounces less than the Dwarf's Weight with all his Cloaths. O o o 2 [470] It may not be improper here to take notice, that as the Measures of the Dwarf were said to be taken with his Cloaths on, these of the Child were also taken over his Cloaths; and they (being a tight Stay and Petticoat) probably sit closer to his Body, and therefore make less Difference in the measuring round his Waist (the only Dimension wherein it could have any Effect) than the looser Coat or Waistcoat of the Dwarf.
