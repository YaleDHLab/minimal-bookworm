An Account of the same, by William Fauquier Esq; F. R. S. ON Thursday the 8th of February, 1749-50. at about half an Hour after 12, as I was sitting reading with one Elbow on Read Feb. 15. 1749-50. [606] on the Table, on the Ground-Floor,in my House a Eltham in Kent, I felt two Shocks from East to West, which I immediately thought was an Earthquake, as I had felt something like it once at Naples; and was confirm'd in my Opinion, by my Wife's running down-stairs frighted,and declar'd it was an Earthquake, she having felt one in the West-Indies. She was in the Room over me, in which Room there was China standing on a Cabinet, which, she says, shook in such a manner that she expected it to fall. My Children, who were in the Room over her, seem to have felt it stronger, as they say, they apprehended a Chest of Drawers in their Room was falling. The Servants that were in the Kitchen, which has no Room under it, seem to have felt but little of it. One that was writing says he felt the Dresser move, and the Wall, but thought it was only the Shutting of a Door. Other Servants in the same Room felt nothing at all of it. My Gardener, who was at Work in the Garden, felt nothing of it. The Wind was at S. W. and had been high in the Night and Morning, but was very much abated; and after this, for some time, it was quite calm; which I believe it is generally observ'd to be, in those Countries where Earthquakes are more frequent. A Flight of Pigeons I have, seem'd to be much frighten'd. Eltham is about 8 Miles S. S. E. from LondonBridge, and stands on a Hill. This Account was written before I had heard any thing from London. 1 V.
