[389] XXV. A new Method of investigating the Sums of infinite Series. By the Rev. S. V I N C E, A. M. of CAMBRIDGE, in a Letter to Henry Maty, A. M. Secretary. Read June 6, 1782. S I R, H A V I N G lately discovered some very easy methods of investigating the sums of certain infinite series, I have taken the liberty of requesting the favour of you to present them to the Royal Society. I have divided the subject into three parts: the first contains a new and general method of finding the sum of those series which DE MOIVRE has found in one or two particular cases; but whose method, although it be in appearance general, will, upon trial, be found to be absolutely impracticable. The second contains the summation of certain series, the last differences of whose numerators become equal to nothing. The third contains observations on a correction which is necessary in investigating the sums of certain series by collecting two terms into one, with its application to a variety of cases. I am, &c. Cambridge, May 3, 1782. P A R T 390 Mr. VINCE'S new Method of P A R T I. L E M. I. Let r be any whole number, and then the fluent of x/1 + xr can always be exhibited by circular arcs and logarithms; but when x = 1, the fluent of the same fluxion will be expressed by the infinite series 1 1/r + 1 + 1/2r + 1 1/3r + 1 + &c. the sum of this series therefore can always be found by circular arcs and logarithms. L E M. II. To find the sum of the infinite series a/1. ~r + 1 a + b/~r + 1. ~2r + 1 + a + 2b/~2r + 1. ~3r + 1 &c. Assume 1 1/r + 1 + 1/2r + 1 1/3r + 1 + &c.. = S; therefore, (A) 1 1/1. ~r + 1 + r + 1/~r + 1. ~2r + 1 2r + 1/~2r + 1. ~3r + 1 + &c.... = S. In the first series, add together the 1st and 2d, the 2d and 3d, &c. &c. terms, and the resulting series will evidently be equal to twice that series minus the first term; therefore, (B), r/1. ~r + 1 r/~r + 1. ~2r + 1 + r/~2r + 1. ~3r + 1 &c.... = 2S 1. Now (A/r) 1/r 1/r/1. ~r + 1 + 1 + 1/r/~r + 1. ~2r + 1 2 + 1/r/~2r + 1. ~3r + 1 + &c.... =S/r, or 1/~r + 1. ~2r + 1 2/~2r + 1. ~3r + 1 + &c.... = S/r; + 1/r 1/r/1. ~r + 1 + 1/r/~r + 1. ~2r + 1 &c.... Now investigating the Sums of infinite Series. 391 Now the sum of the lower series, omitting the first term, is equal to B divided by r2, or = 2S 1/r2; hence, by transposition, and, multiplying both sides by b, we shall have, b/~r + 1. ~2r + 1 2b/~2r + 1. ~3r + 1 + &c... = bS/r + 2bS ~r + 1. b/r2; also by multiplying B by a/r we have a/1. ~r + 1 a/~r + 1. ~2r + 1 + a/~2r + 1. ~3r + 1 -&c.... = 2 a S a/r; subtract the last equation but one from the last, and we shall have a/1. ~r + 1 a + b/~r + 1. ~2r + 1 + a + 2b/~2r + 1. ~3r + 1 &c.... = ~2ra~r + 2. b x S ra + ~r + 1. b/r2 Cor. 1. Hence it appears, that the sum of this series can never be exhibited in finite terms, except a: b as r + 2: 2r, in which case the sum is equal to a/r + 2. Hence, if a = 3, b = 2, then r = 1; ~3/1.2 5/2.3 + 7/3.4 -&c.... = 1; if a = 1, b = 4,then r = 4/3; ~5/3.7 9/7.11 + 13/11.15 17/15.19 + &c.... = 1/6; if a = 4, b = 3, thenr = 6/5; ~ 4/5.11 7/11.17 + 10/17.23 13/23.29 + &c.... =1/20; Cor 2. Put a = c b, and we shall have, after transposition, c/~r + 1. ~2r + 1 c + b/~2r + 1. ~3r + 1 + &c.... = ~3r + 2. b 2rc X S ~2r + 1 b + rc/r2 + c-b/r + 1. P R O P. I. To find the sum of the infinite series m/1. ~r + 1. ~2r + 1 + m+n/~2r + 1. ~3r + 1. ~4r + 1 m+2n/~4r + 1. ~5r + 1. ~6r + 1 + &c. Every 392 Mr. VINCE'S new Method of Every series of this kind may be resolved into the following series a/1. ~r + 1 a+b/~r + 1. ~2r + 1 + a+2b/~2r + 1. ~3r + 1 a+3b/~3r + 1. ~4r + 1 + &c. for if we reduce two terms of this series into one, it will become 2ar b/1. ~r + 1. ~2r + 1 + 2ra +~2r 1. b/~2r + 1. ~3r + 1. ~4r + 1. + 2ra + ~4r 1. b/~4r + 1. ~5r + 1. ~6r + 1 + &c. where the denominators being the same as in the given series, and the numerators also in arithmetic progression, we have only to take a and b such quantities that the respective numerators may be also equal; assume, therefore, 2ra b = m, 2ra + ~2r 1. b = m + n; therefore, b = n/2r, a = 2rm + n/4r2, which substituted for a and b in LEM. 2. gives m/1. ~r + 1. ~2r + 1 + m+n/~2r + 1. ~3r + 1. ~4r + 1 + m+2n/~4r + 1. ~5r + 1. ~6r + 1 + &c.... = 2rm~r + 1. n/2r3 x S + ~2r + 1. n 2rm/4r3.

Let r = 5, and we shall have m/1. 6. 11 + m + n/11. 16. 21 + m + 2n/21. 26. 31 + &c.... = 5m 3n/125 x S + 11n 10m/500. 2 If investigating the Sums of infinite Series. 393 If m = 1, n = 1, 1/1. 6. 11 + 2/11. 16. 21 + 3/21. 26. 31 +&c.... = 2/125 x S + 1/500; m = 1, n = 0, 1/1. 6. 11 + 1/11. 16. 21 + 1/21. 26. 31 + &c.... = S/25 1/50. Cor. If 2r: r + 1:: n: m, the sum of the series can be accurately found, and will be equal to m/2r. r + 1. Let therefore m = r + 1, and then n = 2r, consequently 1/1. 2r + 1 + 1/2r + 1. 4r + 1 + 1/4r + 1. 6r + 1 + &c.... = 1/2r; which is also known from other principles. P R O P. II.

If, instead of substituting in prop. 1. 2b and a for n and m, we had substituted two other quantities, as 2r and s, and then proceeded as above, a series would have been formed, the numerators of whose alternate terms would have formed each a 2 separate arithmetic progression. 2 If investigating the Sums of infinite Series. 395 If the latter series had been added to the former a series would have been formed whose terms would have been all positive; but as I purpose, in the second part of this paper, to give a general method of summing all such series, I shall not stop here to apply this method of investigation.

Having thus far explained the method of summation of such series as I proposed to treat of in the first part of this paper, I trust it is not necessary to say any thing further, as the same method of proceeding will manifestly continue the series to any proposed number of factors in the denominator; I shall therefore conclude with pointing out a remarkable property of those series whose sum can be accurately found: that when the number of factors in the denominator is even, the numerator is always equal to the sum of the two 5 middle investigating the Sums of infinite Series. 401 middle factors; and when the number of factors be odd, the numerator will be equal to the middle factor, and consequently will take it out of the denominator, and leave a series whose numerators are unity, and whose denominators want the middle factor. The method of summation of series here made use of may also be applied in investigating the sums of a great variety of other series; but as a further application of this method would carry us beyond the limits to which this paper must be confined, I shall re-assume the subject at some future opportunity, and proceed immediately to the second part.

Let us now make n infinite and then this term will vanish, and consequently the resulting series will terminate at an infinite distance. Now, by making n infinite in the given series, the two successive terms (as they begin with x + nz/w + nv x + n + a. z/w + n + a. v by making n infinite) become z/v z/v; this series, therefore, is still continued after the other terminates; and the terms of such a continuation will be z/v z/v + z/v z/v + &c. ad infinitum, and whose sum by cor. 2. to the lem. is z/2v; consequently the given series exceeds that which is formed by collecting two terms into one, beginning at the first, by z/2v; hence the sum of the latter series + z/2v will be equal to the sum of the former. Now, if we begin to collect at the second term, then will x + nz/w + nv + x + n + a. z/w + n + a. v be two general terms of the given series to be collected into one; consequently the continuation of the given series, when n becomes infinite, will be z/v + z/v z/v + z/v &c. ad infinitum, whose sum by cor. 2. to the lem. is z/2v; in this case, therefore, the sum of the given series is less than the sum of the series formed by collecting two terms into one, beginning at the second term, by z investigating the Sums of infinite Series. 413 z/2v; hence the sum of the latter series z/2v will be equal to the sum of the former.

Now, if we begin to collect at the first term, the series becomes 5/1.2 + 5/3.4 + 5/5.6 + &c. and the correction, to be added, being 11/2, we have 5/1.2 + 5/3.4 + 5/5.6 + &c. + 11/2 for the sum of the given series; but 5/1.2 + 5/3.4 + 5/6.7 + &c. is equal to 5 X hyp. log. of 2, consequently the sum of the given series is equal to 11/2 + 5 X hyp. log. of 2. Because axv awx/w + nv X w + n + a. v, the general term of the series formed 414 Mr. VINCE'S new Method of formed by reducing two terms into one, has its numerator independent of the value of, n, it is manifest, that the numerators of that series will be all equal. Now, if a series be assumed, the numerators of whose terms are unity, and in every other respect the same as the series in this proposition, that is, if 1/ w + nv 1/w + n + a. v be two successive terms of a series, it is manifest, that if every two terms of this series be reduced into one, the general term of the resulting series will be av/w + nv X w + n + a. v, where the numerator is a constant quantity av; consequently the sum of the series whose general term is avx awz/w + nv X w + n + a. v is to the sum of the series whose general term is av/w + nv X w + n + a. v as vx wz to v, or in a given ratio; whenever, therefore, the sum of the latter series can be found, the sum of the former can be found, and consequently, after proper correction, the sum of the series in this proposition can be found. Hence, therefore, in the two cases given above in whatever arithmetic progression the numerators may proceed, the sum of the former can always be expressed by circular arcs, and the latter by the hyp. log. of 2. Hence also, as it appears from lem. 1. part the first, that the sum of the series 1/1 1/r + 1 + 1/ 2r + 1 1/3r + 1 + &c. can always be expressed by circular arcs and logarithms, it is manifest, that if the numerators form any arithmetic progression, the sum of such series may be found by this proposition, and will always be exhibited by circular arcs and logarithms. Besides investigating the Sums of infinite Series. 415 Besides the series contained in the foregoing propositions, a great variety of other series might be produced where a correction is necessary, after collecting two terms into one, in order to exhibit the true value of the given series. As the proper correction, however, may always be found from the principles delivered in the above propositions, that is, by considering what the terms of the given series become at an infinite distance, I shall only add one or two instances more, and conclude what I at present intend to offer on this subject. EX. 1. Let it be required to find the sum of the infinite series 3.4/1.2 4.5/2.3 + 5.6/3.4 6.7/4.5 + &c. This, by resolving two terms into one, becomes 16/1.2.3 + 24/3.4.5 + 32/5.6.7 &c.; and as the terms of the given series continually approach to unity, the correction, to be added, is 1/2, consequently 16/1.2.3 + 24/3.4.5 + 32/5.6.7 &c. + 1/2 is equal to the sum of the given series; but by prop. 1. part I. the sum of the series 16/1.2.3 + 24/3.4.5 + 32/5.6.7 + &c. is equal to 8S 2 (S being the hyp. log. 2.) consequently the sum of the given series is 8S 1 1/2. EX. 2. Let it be required to find the sum of the infinite series 1.2/1.3 2.3/3.5 + 3.4/5.7 4.5/7.9 + &c. This series, by resolving two terms into one, becomes 4/1.3.5 + 8/5.7.9 + 12/9.11.13 + &c. and as the terms of the given 2 series 416 Mr. VINCE'S new Method, &c. series continually approach to 1/4, the correction, to be added, will be 1/8, therefore 4/1.3.5 + 8/5.7.9 + 12/9.11.13 + &c. + 1/8 is = to the sum of the given series; but by prop. 1. part I. the sum of 4/1.3.5 + 8/5.7.9 + 12/9.11.13 + &c. is equal to 1/4 S + 1/8 (S being a circular arc of 45~, whose radius is unity) hence the sum of the given series is 1/4 S + 1/4. This method is not only applicable to those cases, where the given series resolves itself into another, whose sum is either accurately known or can be expressed by circular arcs and logarithms, but also to those cases where we want to approximate to the value of the given series, as it must, in general, be necessary first to render the terms of the series converging, by collecting two into one, before the operation of approximation begins, and consequently a correction of this latter is necessary in order to exhibit the value of the given series.
