Observations of the apparent distances and positions of 38o double and triple Stars, made in the years 1821, 1822, and 1823, and compared with those of other Astronomers; together with an account of such changes as appear to have taken place in them since their first discovery. .Also a description of a Five-feet Equatorial Instrument employed in the observations. By JOHN FREDERICK WILLIAM HERSCHEL, Esq. F. R. S. and JAMES SOUTH, Esq. F. R. S. Read January iS, 1824. HE frequent and exact determination of the apparent distances and positions of such double stars, as are sufficiently close to be easily measured with micrometers and high magnifying powers, was suggested by Sir WILLIAM HERSCHEL, mnore than forty years ago, as an enquiry likely to lead to interesting results, and which has, in fact, in his hands, led to the creation of a new department of physical astronomy, and to the discovery of a class of phenomena in the sidereal heavens referable to the agency of attractive forces, and analogous to those produced by gravity within the limits of our own system. The immediate object with which the enquiry was commenced, the determination of the existence and amount of annual parallax, was soon lost sight of in the more extensive views of the construction of the universe which unfolded themselves as it advanced, and has not since been resumed; though, from the extreme precision of which it will appear in the course of this paper such measurements are susceptible, owing to the refinements of modern instrument. making (a precision not to be looked for in any other class MDCCCXXIV. B 2 Mr. HERSCHEL'S and Mr. SOUTH'S observations of the apparent of celestial observations) and the progress we may yet hope for from farther improvements in this respect, there is every reason to suppose it still the most eligible mode of setting at rest that great question, and to believe that no distant period must put us in possession of something decisive from this quarter, as to the existence or non-existence of an appreciable amount of that element. Meanwhile unexpected pheanomena have been witnessed. The existence of binary systems, in which two stars perform to each other the offices of sun and planet, has been distinctly proved, and the periods of rotation of more than one such pair ascertained with something approaching to exactness. The immersions and emersions of stars behind each other have been noted, and real motions among them detected, rapid enough to become sensible and measureable in very short intervals of time. The results of Sir WILLIAM HERSCHEL'S observations from 1779 to 1784, were published in two Catalogues in the Philosophical Transactions for 1782 and 1785, and consist of -descriptions and measures of 702 double and triple stars. The labour of re-examination was undertaken and executed by him in i8oi, 2, 3 and 4, after a lapse of twenty -years; and the changes observed or suspected in them were recorded in two other papers, published in the volumes for 1802 and 1804. It was to be naturally expected that, owing to the imperfection of the micrometers with which many of the earlier measures, especially those of 1779 and 178o, were performed, -and the novelty of the subject, many errors would have crept in; and that a verification of the facts, by farther observation, would at all events be highly desirable. Accordingly, in the distances andpositions of 38o double and triple stars, &c. s year i8i6, a second re-examination of the measures was entered on by his Son (one of the authors of this paper), and some progress made in it; several of the results of which will be found attached to the measures in the following pages. The instruments in Mr. SOUTH'Spossession being peculiarly adapted to the purpose, a similar idea had also occurred to him; and, at his suggestion, it was determined to undertake the work of re-examiination in concert, which was accordingly commenced in March, 1821, and continuedwhenever weather and circumstances would permit, till the present time. Meanwhile (though at that time unknown to us), a similar undertaking had been commenced and carried to a considerable extent by a very exact and assiduous continental astronomer, Mr. STRUVE, Director of the Imperial Observatory of Dorpat. The comparison of his observations of such of our stars as have been measured by him with our own, will not be-found the least interesting part of the present paper. So far as it goes, the coincidences of our results, with very few exceptions, are striking; and afford the most satisfactory ground for reliance on the methods employed by both. Professor AMIcd, of Modena, has also of late occupied himself in the pursuit of the same object, with instruments said to be of extraordinary power. Very few, however, of his results have come to our knowledge, and those imperfectly stated; hence it may fairly be presumed that the differences existing between them and our own, will be found to admit of easy explanation. The instruments employed in our combined observations, are two capital achromatic telescopes mounted equatorially, of the respective focal lengths of five and seven feet. These 4, Description of Mr. SOUTH'S are cited in the following pages by the names of the five-feet and the seven-feet equatorials; and a brief account of them, especially of the former, will neither be uninteresting to the practical astronomer, nor irrelevant to the objects of this communication. Five-feet Equatorial. The greatest part of this instrument, with regard to bulk, is constructed of tinned iron plate. Its characteristic qualities are great lightness, extreme steadiness, promptness in answering to its adjustments, and capability of retaining them. The instrument, as represented in fig. 1, Plate I, is drawn on a scale of one-twelfth of the real dimensions. The view is taken at right angles to the plane of the declination circle. The polar axis is about ten feet and a half long. The lower end is a pivot attached to a cone, which, reckoning upwards, is about one-fourth of the whole length, the sides of this cone making with each other an angle of about fifty degrees. The higher side of the cone, for about a foot of its length, is cut in a sloping direction, as seen in the figure, for the purpose of more conveniently observing in the vicinity of the pole. From, the upper end of the cone, the polar axis branches into two parts, between which is room for the declination circle and the head of the observer: these two branches are again united at the top by an open frame of bell-metal, represented in fig. 2, to which the upper pivot is attached; which frame, as well as the iron work which supports it, is so contrived, as to present the least possible surface to obstruct the telescope. For the same reason, the pivot at the top of the axis is made as small as possible, while that at the lower end is considerably larger. Both ends of Fve-feet Equatorial Instrument. the axis are supported on stones; the northern one rising within about four inches of the level of the axis of the declination circle; the rest of the support being of wrought iron. At the southern end the stone rises very little above the floor, but a cast iron frame > supports the pivot at the height of about two feet. The Y. or angle which receives the lower pivot, is placed upon the frame, and provided with two screw adjustments, one for giving the axis its due elevation, and the other for bringing the instrument to the meridian. The form of the iron-work above-mentioned will be sufficiently comprehended on consulting the different figures of the Plates. The two branches of the polar axis, on their upper sides, are formed of broad planes, both making one continued plane. On these surfaces the axis and reading microscopes of the declination circle are fixed. The plane is as much above the line of centre as was judged would render the instrument self-balanced; but the declination circle, &c. having proved somewhat lighter than was expected, an equilibrium is effected by a weight fixed to the conical part of the polar axis, The diameter of the declination circle is four feet, the length of the telescope five feet and the axis about thirty-two inches long. In Plate I, fig. 1, the declination circle appears quite plane, exhibiting the form of a drum-head, with the telescope looking towards the equator, and projecting at each end a little beyond the circle. In Plate II, the draughtsman stood close to the south pole of the instrument, on account of which, and its elevation, the polar axis is considerably foreshortened. In this figure the edge of the declination circle is shown as a short cylinder, the object-end of the telescope protruding beyond it. In this figure is also seen the shape of the 6Description of Mr. SOUTH'S declination axis, and the two principal reading microscopes, viz. those which give declinations. There is a third microscope, which indicates zenith distances. This is seen in Plate I. fig. i, between the eye end of the telescope and the instrument's elevated pole. In the latter figure is shown, on the extreme border of the drum, a narrow brass ring, whereon the graduation is made. This ring is not only narrow, but as thin as was judged consistent with sound workmanship; this slightness is necessary, because iron plate and brass expand very differently, but the former being much stronger, the latter must obey it: the brass is soldered to the iron, and also pinned to it at short intervals. The hour circle, two feet in diameter, is fastened to the lower end of the pollar axis, the edge of which is seen in Plate I. fig. 1, its under side in Plate II., and its face in Plate III. fig. 5* One of the reading microscopes is well seen in Plate IS fig. i, and both of them, less perfectly in the other two figures. The whole of this circle was of brass, and the divisions were at first made upon that metal; but twenty-two years exposure to the atmosphere in the neighbourhood of London had obliterated the graduation. This has been restored by Mr. TROUGHTON, upon an inlaid ring of platina9 the divisions (fine lines) corresponding to twenty seconds each, which are subdivided by the microscopes to tenths of seconds. The declination circle is divided to five minutes, which are subdivided by the micrometer screw of the microscopes to single seconds with a capability of estimating further subdivisions. The instrument is furnished with two good ground levels, neither of which are seen in any of the figures. The divided side of the declination circle has been called a drum ; but the reverse is articulated; Five-feet Equatorial Ins~trument. 7 showing how the conical parts of the axis and telescope are united, as well as the radial bars which proceed from the axis and telescope almost to the border of the circle, and how these bars, thin as the tinned plate is, are rendered firm and inflexible. It is on this side that the levels would be seen; one of them is parallel to the telescope, the other to the declination axis. In fig. i, is seen the support of one end of the latter, above the polar axis, and nearly half way between the centre of the circle and its limb ; here a circular aperture in the drum is represented as being quadrisected by a cross. This has, inserted in its centre, a small pivot or cylinder pointed inwards, upon which one end of the level is supported, while, on the articulated side, a cross and similar pivot support the opposite end. Both of the pivots are adjustable by screws, and the adjustment being duly performed by them, the horizontality of the axis is ascertained in every position of the telescope, when directed to the meridian. The other level, which is the larger, hangs upon similar adjustable pivots, which adjustment being performed, places the level parallel to the line of collimation of the telescope, serving at all times to ascertain the due elevation of the polar axis, as well as to answer many other useful purposes. The clamps and screws for slow motion deserve notice; the former from being unusual, and both from being good. Instead of the common mode of clamping upon the circle, in this instrument the clamp is made to grasp the axis. There is soldered on each axis a ring of brass, the outer edge of which is broad and cylindrical. On this fixed ring a movable one is well fitted, and afterwards cut into three equal parts. These are again united at two places by joints, like 8 Descrztin of Mr. SOUTH'S those which bind the different parts of a watch-chain together. At the third juncture the clamping takes place; a pro. jecting part of the ring having been left where the third section is made, and a strong screw at right angles to this section, which is made to gape, brings the parts towards each other, and effects a firm embrace. The clamping apparatus, so far described, was avowedly borrowed from the means used for fixing the shaft of an ordinary wind-mill. To the middle of each of the trisected rings are fastened long arms of tinned iron plate, at the extremities of which the slow moving screws have their places. The fixed stud is in the lower screw planted in the iron support; that of the upper one in the polar axis ; the moveable studs are of course connected with the levers. The long screw for slow motion in right ascension is acted on by a contrate wheel and a pinion at right angles to the plane of the circle; a long handle attached to it is shown in Plate I, fig. i, leaning against the northern pier. A similar screw for declination, but without the contrate part, is seen in Plate II, fig. 3. All the apparatus for clamping and slow motion is seen in Plates I, II, and IlI, figures I1, , and 5. It may be remarked, that in the 'apparatus described, the right-ascension motion does not at all disturb that in declination ; nor does that of declination affect the other: properties most essential to facilitate and render accurate, micrometrical observations; properties not to be expected, with the same precision, from those contrivances to which micrometers are usually attached, known by the name of equatorial stands. The illumination of the wires of the telescope is produced by a small lantern, which has its -place at one end of the 1 ?>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~XMIN INNOWN11\11 I__il__-_IzJI/.AofI ( (XCXPIIAdtNXF ~~~~~~~~~~~~~z J41~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ ______________________________________~Art I; -------|---FllU H AW~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~1 'g~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ I / \ \ss X H =: ! ; -Jo -; --2g i ; --ark tER i-:;-tASt t ; i:i l -; '-t X ::g -l; -5: :-i = E -; = t= BE W = : ---: : m:-::::i =-' : e l --is -; =-it _A _ __ 0 _ l' ; . _ 4 -; ;w __ Em 2 iW h .1_ | .1 2-= ! w_ | A-_ A_ _ A; _ w _ _ :' __ _, _S i, :,, _^ I = " ffi a,,, :. ::er-. .__._ ', -''-_ is = ' __ I __ . t'<KHM ?

There is a neat contrivance placed between the nosel of the lantern and end of the axis, by which the quantity of light is regulated, so as to suit the nature of any observation that may be made; and such is the amplitude of this illumination, that, on one hand, the brightness of broad day is produced, and on the other, total darkness. In any position of the telescope, and while the object is viewed, the adjustment of light can be conveniently effected, by means of a long handle shown in Plate I. fig. , Changing down on the hither side of the polar axis. In Plate III. fig. 4, the eye-piece of the; telescope is represented, in which there is seen the edge of a graduated circle, the front of a quadrant, and two small spirit levels. This apparatus is particularly described by Sir G. SHUCKBURGHI, in the Phil. Trans. 1793; by which, and by some small tables given in his paper on the Equatorial, the corrections due to refraction and parallax are neatly allowed for, in observations made at a distance from the meridian. There is also seen in this figure, rather partially represented, a double parallel line micrometer (sometimes called a repeating micrometer), which also measures angles of position. Although this apparatus has had not a little to do with the observations recorded in this paper, it is forborne to give a detailed account of it: ist., because it would considerably lengthen this description, which, it is feared, many will think too long already; -dly, because a great number of these micrometers are in the pos. session of practical astronomers, and of course their construction is tolerably well known; and, lastly, because they have been described in our modern Encyclopaedias.* It isO REBs's Encyclopedia, Article Micrometer. BREWSTERX' ditto, ditto.MDCCCXXIV. C io Description of Mr. SOUTH'S thought however, that the micrometer under considerations was the first that had a position circle large enough to show distinctly minutes of a degree, by help of its verniers. This equatorialwas designed to suit its first situation, viz. on the top of a house, where, to the north, higher buildings prevented any distant objects from being seen, and to the south, a smoky town presented almost as great an obstruction. The instrument being elevated 50 feet above solid ground, it became absolutely necessary that a permanent mark should from time to time be consulted. This advantage only presented itself to the westward, where, at a pro per distance, the ground was not much below the level 'of the instrument; and to suit it to these circumstances, the declination axiswas converted into a telescope-. The effect produced by this, is similar to that of the Y level of the civil engineers, but with this difference: it is here required that each end of the axis should alternately be presented to the object, and that in reversed positions the telescope Ishould have equal power. For these purposes, both ends have crossed wires, adjustable so as to be placed in the centres of their respective pivots. Exterior to the wires are placedob. ject glasses of equal focal lengths, and an eye-glass, removable from one end to the other, completes the apparatus. The whole instrument having been adjusted astronomically, it was easy to build up a mark to the level of the axis, and also at right angles to the meridian, which afterwards became a substitute for a meridian mark, and also afforded an excellent mean foradjusting the reading microscopes of the hour circle. The instrument bears no maker's name. The wholes Five-feet Equatorial Instrument. 11 scheme of its fabric was cast by the late Captain HUDDART, many years a worthy Fellow of this Society. All the tinned iron work was made, under the direction and inspection of the same able engineer. Under the like superintendence also, was the brass work made, by J. and E. TROUGHTON; who having furnished it with graduation, reading microscopes, levels, &c. completed the instrument in 1797. The excellent object-glass for the telescope of .3inches aperture was made by the late P. and J. DOLLOND. The power ordinarily employed isi3; besides which, powers of 68, i6 240, 303, and 381, were occasionally used, being double eyepieces; and in some few cases a single lensl with a power of 578 was employed for the purpose of minute scrutiny. The extent of the field with these powers (in their order beginning with the lowest, 68) was respectively S' 31', 20', 19', 13', ik', and e . l . . To preserve the tinned iron plate from oxidation, it has been well covered with white paint, and afterwards varnished; thus it has not only a neat appearance, but can be cleaned at any time, without difficulty. The present situation of this instrument, in the immediate vicinity of one of the great thoroughfares of this immense metropolis, required the adoption of particular precautions against tremors. The northern pier is therefore, sunk seven feet into the earth, where it is bedded on a Yorkshire flag four feet square, and two feet in thickness, into which the pier is firmly tenoned and fastened by stone wedges. From this flag rises a mass of brickwork to the level of the surface, surrounding the pier, and united with PARKER'S cement, having the area of its horizontal section equal to that of the 1 2Mr. HERSCHEL'S and Mr. SOUTH'S observations of the apparent flag. The weight of this effectually secures the stability of the foundation stone. The southern pier likewise consists of a large stone, two feet in thickness, resting on a bed of brickwork, carried downwards ten feet below the surface. So effectual are these precautions, that stars pass with perfect regularity along the whole extent of the declination wire, while the heaviest waggons are traversing the street within forty feet of the instrument, which, in one instance, has kept its adjustments, and been actually employed as a transit for six weeks, without sensible alteration. Indeed, whilst in Captain HUDDART'S possession, it was almost exclusively used as a meridian instrument. The object glass of the seven feet equatorial is the work of Mr. TULLEY, and may perhaps be regarded at present as the chef d'oeuvre of that eminent artist. It is five inches in clear aperture, and in distinctness under high magnifying powers* is probably excelled by no refractor existing. Proof of this will be found in the separation and measurement of the most minute double stars, such as o and q Coronas Borealis, in its sharp definition of the double ring of Saturn, and various other of the most delicate celestial objects. It is mounted on a polar axis of brass, furnished with declination and hour circles of the same metal, the work of the late Mr. SIssoN ; being, in fact, those of the old equatorial sector of the Royal Observatory, committed to our care for this purpose by the Council of the Royal Society (to whom our thanks are therefore due) and of which a more particular de*Under favourable circumstances, with a power of 6oo, the discs of the two stars of x Corona and of a Corona; of ? Bootis and of C Orionis, are shown perfectly round, and as sharply defined as possible. distances and positions of 88o double and triple stars, &c. 1s scription, accompanied with a plate, will be found in page 141 of VINCE's Practical Astronomy. The axis is supported by strong piles of wood sunk deep into the earth; and though not quite exempt from, tremors, is sufficiently so for the performance (with due care) of the most accurate and delicate measurements. The telescope is furnished with a micrometer, the work of TROJGHTON, similar in all respects to that of the five feet just described, with the exception of a peculiar apparatus carryingan additional moveable cross wire, for a purpose not connected with' the present paper. The ordinary observing power employed-with this telescope was 179, but occasionally a lower powerof o05, and a higher one of 273, were also used. The illumination of the field is effected by a lamp attached to the tube, and (as in the five feet), may be increased or diminished to any extent. The values of the parts of the scale of each micrometer were determined by separating the wires a certain known number of revolutions and parts, and having placed them in the direction of the meridian, measuring repeatedly the time occupied by the passage of an equatorial star, or other of known declination, from wire to wire. By this method, one part of the scale of the five-feet micrometer was ascertained to represent o".31582,:and of the seven feet, o".l4o44. The equality of the threads of the screw was proved by the same value resulting, whatever opening, of the wires was employed; and! the parallelism* of them in either micrometer was perfect. The position of the declination wire, when set to zero, was frequently examined by running a star * The wires employed in these micrometers, are spider's lines of extreme tenuity, and were inserted by Mr. SIMMS. 14 Mr. HERSCHEL'S and Mr. SOUTH's observations of the apparent from one end to the other, backwards and forwards, by the right ascension motion of the instrument; but being once well adjusted, was found liable to no change, except in one instance, when the micrometer had received a blow, the defect produced by which was immediately discovered and rectified. Respecting the precautions used in observing, a few words will suffice. In measuring distances, the stars were bisected by both wires and kept on them by means of the long handle of the slow R. A. motion, held in the left hand, and gently turned between the finger and thumb, the right being at liberty to manage the micrometer. This, though rather difficult at first, becomes, easy by a little practice, and even in unfavourable positions, the effect of the earth's diurnal motion may be almost exactly neutralised with a little management. The measures of distance are therefore: all central, a circumstance the more necessary to be noticed, by reason of the greater size of the spurious discs of stars in refracting, than in reflecting telescopes. In taking angles of position, these spurious discs are often extremely troublesome, as their inequality renders it very difficult (especially in close stars), to judge of the position, of the line joining their centres. In such cases a green, or even a slightly smoked glass, was sometimes used in viewing bright stars, or advantage taken of the favourable intervention of a thin cloud, which reduces them to mere points, or even of broad daylight, to obliterate their rings and scattered light, &c. Such cases are noticed when they occur, but it may not be amiss to mention, that the angle of position of a pair of very close stars, or very unequal ones, at a moderate distance, (SUch as E Bootis, , Orionis, &c.), can never be obtained with any degree of certainty by a single distances -and positions of 380 double and triple stars, &c. 15 measure, -especially when the two stars, as in the above instances, differ greatly in colour, The requisite degree of illumination is a matter of great consequence, and differs in almost each particular star. In relation to tthis, a singuular phenomenon deserves mention. Many very minute stars bear, without extinction, strong degrees of illumination, and are even seen the better for it, while others, apparently brighter, have been found unable to bear even the slightest extraneous light. This may probably be owing to an excess of blue light in the star, forming a contrast with the ruddy tint of the lamp illumination: at least, the most remarkable instances of the ph'anomenon in quest tion are, those in which the small star is decidedly of a blue colour. A rather singular method of obtaining a view, and even a rough measure of the angles of stars of the last degree of faintness, has often been resorted to, viz. to direct the eye to another part of the field. In this way, a faint star in the neighbourhood of a large one, will often become very conspicuous, so as to bear a certain illumination which will yet totally disappear, as if suddenly blotted out, when the eye is turned full upon it, and so on, appearing and disappearing * Scorpii is much improved by illumination. a, Lyre.

The small companion of ?3 (h) Ursxe Majoris, is a remarkable instance, and others will be found in the note.* The lateral portions of the :retina, less fatigued by strong lights, and less exhausted by perpetual attention, are probably more sensible to faint impressions than the central ones, which may serve to account for this phaenomenon. The measures were, for the most part, taken by both observers in each other's presence, the one acting as assistant, and writing down what the other announced. Frequently, however, -this disposition, dictated by convenience, was changed, and the observations made by one were read off, as well as written down, by the other, and the results not communicated till the measures were finished. This mode of checking each other's measures, the severest which can well be resorted to when two persons -observe together, was however only adopted, when., from a discrepancy in the first measures, some suspicion of a bias in the eye, or judgment of one or other, arose, in cases of peculiar interest, or in the earlier part of the work, before practice had confirmed our confidence. When the two instruments were used at once however, which during the last year's observations was almost perpetually the case, the observers were necessarily separated from each other, and their results only communicated on the following morning, at the time of taking and applying the index errors.' In a very few instances, the assistance of a third person has been called in, to give a turn to our opinion in a doubtful case. 'Mr. RICHARDSON, of the Royal Observatory, has generally * ?

Geminorum. distances andpositions of 380 double and triple stars, &c. 17 been the person selected for this purpose, as possessing the necessary qualifications of an eye practised* in observations with this particular instrument, a correct hand, and unbiassed impartiality. A few measures by Mr. TROUGHTO1 will also be found on similar occasions. Of the general disposition of the following paper, it will now be necessary to give some account. The stars observed by us, are arranged in order of right ascension, and such names, synonyms, and references are attached, as will serve to identify them in the writings of other astronomers. The catalogues of Mr. SOUTH? and Mr STRUVE , have been exitremely useful to us; the latter being much more extensive than the former, the number of each star, in the order in which it stands in that work, is annexed: the synonyms therein given are also generally adopted, with such additions and corrections as seemed necessary. Our observations will be found to include many stars given by Sir WILLIAM HERSCHEL, in his catalogue of 145 new double stars, printed in the Memoirs of the Astronomical Society, Vol. 1. These are cited by their numbers (for instance, 41 of the 145.) Some few discovered by ourselves, are either mentioned as new, or may be known by the absence of any other reference. The right ascensions and declinations are generally those of STRUVE. When de.* Prior to his appointment at Greenwich, Mr. RICHARDSON, by daily experience, had been long familiar with the Blackman-street instruments. t This catalogue was arranged in the year i 8 i8, by Mr. S. and was intended for private use only; at the request, however, of the Reverend Dr. PEARSON, it was communicated to the Astronomical Society, in the spring of X 82o. t This catalogue, unfortunately, did not reach us till the commencement of the present year.MDCCCXXIV. D i8 Mr. HERSCHEL'S and Mr. SOUTH'S observations of the apparent termined by ourselves, they may be regarded as true to the nearest minute in declination (unless for southern stars, where the neglect of refraction will entail a larger error), and to a few seconds in R. A. The identification of the stars being our only* object, greater accuracy was not attempted, than would suffice for setting the instrument directly upon them. Next follow our observations as written down at the time, or at least as allowed to stand, at the moment of terminating the measure. It would have been easy indeed, by giving only the mean results of whole sets of measures, to have produced an appearance of very exact coincidences ; but this has not been so much our S object, as to show, by an actual expose of the whole work, what degree of confidence is due to our results, and what extent of deviation from mean quantities, other observers, who may enter upon the same enquiry with similar instruments, may fairly expect to meet with. In this respect, very few liberties have been taken. To have rendered this paper as complete as possible, it was Mr. SOUTn' s intention to have accompanied it with the observed places of each principal star, brought up to a particular epoch, and some progress towards effecting it was actually made so far back as February, i 82i : but, although the transits of fifty stars, over all the wires of his instrument, were occasionally observed by him in one night, the scheme was found to interfere so much with the primary object, that it was deemed advisable to relinquish it. Should, however, their places remain undetermined, possessing, as he does, the instrumental means of ascertaining them, ,with the greatest accuracy, his original design, (if health allow), will probably be not abandoned. Still, it must be remembered, that, two or three hundred double stars yet remain unmeasured; this done, the period must be distant, ere a private individual can, with his own eyes, (be his industry great as it may), furnish standard observations, both in Right Ascension and Declination, of seven hundred stars, many of which are only visible in the illuminated fields of our large meridian instruments, under circumstances which, in this country, are of very rare occurrence. distances and positions of 380 double and triple stars, &c. 19 When indeed a measure (on looking down the list, without reference to the observations of former nights) was found to differ considerably from the rest, the micrometer was usually set to the suspicious reading off, and the measure re-examined by both observers. If declared erroneous (and the contrary would occasionally happen), it was corrected by him whose measure it originally was, and the result set down in the place of that rejected. In general, the degree of discordance in the measures of any particular star, may be taken as a pretty fair criterion of the difficulty which attended the observation. The instrument with which each set of measure. was taken, is mentioned. In the north preceding and south following quadrants, the micrometers show angles of position complementary to the true ones. These are, however, (except in one or two instances) set down as read off, and the mean afterwards subtracted from goo. In the measures of distance, the index error is applied to the mean of the micrometer parts in each set, and the result reduced into seconds is stated. The index error was at first only taken at pretty consider-, able intervals; but, being soon found liable to a trifling change, it was afterwards regularly taken on the morning after each night's observation, or at least as soon as circumstances would permit. The zeros applied are means of at least five, but frequently of ten separate determinations. In order to make this paper more complete, and to save trouble to those who may wish to consult our measures, or prosecute farther this interesting department of astronomy, we have presented at the end of our observations of each star, 1st, the mean result of our own measures, reduced to a mean so Mr. HERSCHEL'S and Mr. SOUTH's observations of the apparent epoch, in computing which, each single measure (unless the contrary is expressly mentioned) is supposed to have the same weight: and, 2dly, a brief statement of all the results obtained by other observers, as far as they are known to us, arranged-in the order of their dates, for the sake of comparison with our own, so as to give, as it were, a history of all that is known on the subject. Among them, a multitude of hitherto unpublished observations of Sir W. HERSCHEL are inserted from his Journals and Registers; many lacunae in the history of particular stars filled up, and the chain of observation continued unbroken up to the present time. One or two points here require notice. ist. The dates of his observations will generally be found to differ from those attached to the description of the stars in his Catalogues. The reason is, that the dates here given are those of the observations, as they occur in the Journals, or their mean, if more than one, while the dates in the Catalogues are those when the stars were first discovered to be double. 2dly, Both the angles and distances will also be frequently at variance with those printed in Sir WILLIAMIS Catalogues. This must be explained more at large. Unless a mean result is expressly mentioned, the angles and distances in his Catalogues are invariably the results of single measures. However numerous the measures taken, one has been selected as the best, and all the rest rejected. So great a degree of confidence in single measures, however, is hardly borne out by our experience; and the results we have inserted from the Journals and Registers, are therefore the means of all that could be found, such only being rejected as offer something obviously objectionable. We have only to cast our eyes at the obserdistances andpositions of 380 double and triple stars, &c. ?a vations of Rigel, to see how widely they differ from each other, and yet how exactly their mean agrees with that of our own, to be satisfied that, in so doing, not only no improper liberty is taken, but much valuable labour rescued from oblivion, which would otherwise have been lost to science. In numerous instances, too, whole series of observations have been found, and their mean results inserted. These are generally noted by the letters MSS. annexed. Finally, such remarks are subjoined as comparisons of modern with ancient measures of the same star suggest. In numerous instances they confirm the changes previously surmised to have taken place by Sir W. HERSCHEL, in his papers of 1803 and 1804. In a few they afford no such satisfactory confirmation. In more than one instance, they furnish important verifications of the proper motions assigned to particular stars by MASKELYNE, PIAZZI, and others; while in some, on the other hand, the degree of permanence in the relative situations of the large and small stars is hardly less remarkable. After the main body of observations, we have added a list of a few stars less perfectly measured, or of which, from their uncommon difficulty, the observations are too precarious to be received as satisfactory. The only reason for inserting them is, that should there ever hereafter arise a question respecting them, any measures made with some care and with good instruments are better than none at all, and may become useful, though confessedly imperfect data. This reason is strengthened by the probability that their difficulty, and the little apparent interest they offer, will cause them to be disr2 Mr. -HERSCHEL'S and Mr. SOUTH'S observations of the apparent regarded by future observers, till peculiar views occur to recal them to attention.

X The slow decrease in the angle of position is here suffi ciently evident, though too small to place any confidence in, were it not for the progressive steps by which the intermediate observations show it to have taken place. The rate of decrease, calculating on all the observations according to the formula (1) is no more than 00.117 per annum, in the direction np sf, or retrograde. Supposing it to revolve uniformly in a circle, its period, would at this rate be 3077 years. The distance, in 1783, was il diameter of the large star. M. STRUVE, in 1819, made it 5".77, with which ours coincides, almost to minute precision. The -distance, therefore, as well as the angle, seems to be subject to a slow variation, as a diameter and half between the discs, in equal stars of the 7th magnitude, can hardly exceed 4" from centre to centre.

The observations of stars very near the pole require a correction to reduce them from one date to another, by reason of the motion of the pole in the heavens due to precession, which alters more or less rapidly their angle of position. In Polaris, the annual variation of the angle (being sp) is -195"'' 3' 15". Hence the correction for 42 years is 2? i6', which, applied to the measure of 1781.50, reduces it to 640 46' Sp. The observation of 1802 similarly treated, becomes 600 38', coinciding very well with the present angle. A correction similar in principle, will of course be required for all the stars, after the lapse of long periods; and the only way to obviate the necessity of using it, would be to refer all the angles to the ecliptic, and its parallels; but we are at present very far from the necessity of a: reduction requiring so much labour. distances andpositions of 38o double and triple stars, &c. 41 No. XVI.

The change therefore in the angle of position, surmised by Sir W. HERSCHEL in his Account of Changes, &c. is not confirmed. Indeed it was chiefly concluded by him from the angle deduced from MAYER'S observations, which of course must be very precarious. On the other hand, the distance seems to be subject to a trifling decrease, though perhaps the circumstance of the diameters of the two stars being included in the measures of 1780, may account for the excess in those observations. 46 Mr. HERSCHELSs and Mr. SOUTH'S observations of the apparent No. XXII.

The angle therefore seems liable to no alteration, but the distance is increased if the measure of 1783 be correct but it is only the result of a single measure. This star is remarkable for the great differences between the means of several independent sets of measures, while the star presents no peculiar difficulty. One of the angles differs 3023f from the mean of all ; and this may be considered the maximum error to which the measure of an angle can be considered liable, unless in peculiar cases.

The distances agree perfectly, but there is something unsatisfactory about all the angles, the mean of Mr. HERSCHEL'S observations being 450 371, and of Mr. SOUTH'S 420 14', while the coincidence of each set with itself, indicates an evident bias in the judgment of one or both of the observers from some casual cause.

The star -here observed :was found by setting the equatorial to the place of 1o Trianguli. STRUVE, (Dorpat Obs. ii. 167, Obs. 144), makes 1o Trianguli a double star, but gives distances andpositions of 380 double and triple stars, &c. 55 its position 240 12' sp, and calls the stars 8 and 7.8 magnitudes. The star IV. 40, is called simply FL. 10 Trianguli (a) in the Catalogue of 1782; but in the MSS. Journal for that year we find this remark, " My IV. 4o, is near iO. It is the c preceding telescopic star of a small triangle, whereof the largest is lo Trianguli.." The distance of IV. 40, in 1781, was 17"-.37. So that if this be the star, its distance must have decreased considerably. But when every circumstance is equivocal it is useless to conjecture. No. XXXII R. A. 2h 26m; Decl. 230 52' N.

Go Mr. HERSCHEL'S and Mr. SOUTH's observations of the apparent The change of position in the interval between 1782 and 10oe is therefore not verified, and has probably arisen from some error in the earlier observation. The loss or disappearance of the third star, described as in a line with the other two, and 25 or 26" distant, is therefore to be regetted, and is the more singular, as a MSS observation (Journal. Dec. 23, 1782) describes it as easier to be perceived" than the nearer one.

Yet, had it been then as distinctly separated as at present, it is not possible it could have been overlooked, when kept long enough in view to take an accurate measure, in the course of which the attention must have been closely directed to either star. Still less could it have escaped notice in the reviews of the heavens, in the course of which it has often been examined with minute attention with reference to this very point, as the Journals written at the time testify. On the 29th of September, 1782, during one of the reviews on which the Catalogue of 1785 is founded, it was examined with the 7 feet reflector, power 460, and is called'" white, distinctly round, double," the double referring obviously to the more distant star, and the " distinctly round" to the principal, or central one, according to usual custom. A beautiful star of the first class could never have escaped registering by neglect, when the object was expressly to form a Catalogue of such stars, and we are therefore forced to conclude, that in 1782, the small star was so closely covered by the large one, as not even to elongate its disc. ( Herculis and a Cygni have afforded instances of sidereal occultations, in which one star has completely disappeared behind the other, and o Coronae appears to be on the point of performing the same singular evolution. This is the first instance, however, of the reverse process, for the observation MDCCCXXIV. N 9o Mr. HERSCHEL'S and Mr. SOUT'S observations of the aarent ( Orionis continued. of M.

The evenihg being very unfavourable for procuring satisfactory measures of double stars generally, in consequence of the uniform diffusion of thin clouds, which gave to the stars of the ist and 2d magnitudes the appearance of being only of the 31rd and 4th, the instrument was directed to Castor when it was half an hour west of the meridian: the two stars were admirably defined, perfectly steady, without concentric rings, and of the 5th and 6th magnitudes only, and the following angles were gotten; they were highly satisfactory.

In the next period of 22.2 years to the measures of 1802 (which from the number taken may be relied on), 21?.4 Only were described, giving an angular velocity of o'.964, or about the average; while in the third (and probably most accurate) period of 21.1 years, only 16o.4 were described, giving an angular velocity of 00.777 per annum, being as much below the average as that of the first 20 years is above it.

The change of position has also been accompanied with a considerable diminution of distance; and further observations must decide whether this is the result of rectilinear or orbitual motion. If the former, i i6 Mr. HERSCHEL'S andMr. SoUTH's observations of the apparent the minimum of distance will be attained in about 40 years from the present time, and the change during that period much less rapid than heretofore. On the other hand, an orbitual motion will be indicated by the distance continuing to diminish beyond that limit, and probably too by an acceleration in the angular motion. A certain acceleration indeed is already perceptible, 100 having been described in the first twenty years, and 1,gj in the last; but no great reliance is to be placed on this, as the earlier measures depend only on single observations. Meanwhile the change remarked by Sir W. HERSCHEL in his paper of 1804, is fully confirmed both by M. STRUVE'S observations and our own. No. XCI. R.

The measures of this star have furnished a curious instance of a constant difference between the observations of two observers ; the one always observing angles above the mean, the other below it; and that not one night only, but after long intervals, without communication, &c. Occasionally each observer read off the other's measure, and each declared his eye offended by the situation of the micrometer wire as left by the other. The differences being found irreconcileable, other practised observers were called in to decide the point, whose measures, as will be seen, had no such effect. However the mean angle 6? '7' here set down, being the result of 47 single measures, by four different observers, and on five nights, embracing an interval of two years, cannot well be erroneous to any extent.

The difference of size and closeness of these stars renders the measure of their position uncommonly difficult; but as the angle here set down is a mean of 41 single measures, we cannot suppose it materially in error, especially as it is very nearly a mean between the results of the two best sets of obh servations-those of April, 1821, and April, 1823, which, taken alone would give 80 29' sf.

The angle thus obtained from no less than 58 measures, with its corresponding mean date, will serve for an epoch in which the computer I4 Mr. HE1 dHL' and Mr. SOUTH'S observations f the -apparent g Ursae Majoris continued. at some future period, may rely with confidence in any investigation relative to the orbit of this "star. A double star in which the two stars are nearly equal, connected undoubtedly in a binary system by their mutual gravitation, and revolving round their common center of gravity with a motion so rapid as to admit of being traced, and measuredfrom month to month, must be allowed to be a phtenomenon of no common interest, and deserving every attention, both from the practical and theoretical astronomer. The rapid alteration of position in k Urse Majoris, was first pointed out and established by unequivocal observations by Sir W. HERSCHEL, in his second X; Account of the changes that have happened in the relative situations of double stars," Phil. Trans. 1804, already so often referred to. The observations of M. STRUVE (who has called the attention of astronomers to it in a pointed manner) and our own, fully confirm it ; at the samne time that they indicate a remarkable alteration in its velocity, which can only be accounted for by supposing the relative orbit to be one of great ellipticity. The whole series of observations from the first notice of it as a double star, to the present time, will stand as follows: Position. 1781i.7 (Dec. 19) 534' sf; H.

In the next interval ox i,5o Mr. HERSCHEL'S and Mr. SouTH's observations of the apparent 16.93 years, 1770.75 were described, being at the mean rate of 100.499 per annum. In the next period, of 1.74 years, the angle described was 120.o3, or 6'.914 per annum; while in the succeeding short period of 1.54 years, the motion amounted only to 60.84 or 40.442 per annum. It is therefore at present rapidly decreasing, and the maximum annual mon tion must, at some period between 18o3 and 1820, have greatly exceeded 100.499, and perhaps may have amounted to 20 or 300. This consideration would lead us to place the perihelion of the orbit in the north-preceding quadrant, between the 3oth and 6oth degree from the parallel, and to suppose its plane greatly inclined to the visual line, in a plane not far from that passing through the eye and the major axis of the orbit; and this agrees well with the change of disc tance, which is certainly less at present than in 1782, though the estimation by diameters is necessarily very uncertain. In the present imperfect state of the data, it would-be uses less to enter into any minute investigations respecting the elements of the orbit; but when twenty or thirty years ob. servations shall have enabled us to trace precisely the variation of the angular motion up to the aphelion and to as. certain, by direct observation, the periodic time and mean motion, the principles of physical astronomy may be applied, and the case is one particularly favourable to their application, so that we may hope one day to obtain a precise knowledge of all the most important points respecting this interesting system. It is to be regretted that owing to an error in the place of this star in BODE'S Catalogue, it was not observed by us at an earlier date; the comparison of our observations with those of M.

This star appears to have undergone a very remarkable diminution of distance, and at the same time a material ins crease in the mean motion of its component stars one about the other. The computed occultation of CASSINI in 17 o cannot have any dependance placed on it, as the lunar tables can hardly be supposed correct enough to carry us back loo yearsfrom the present time, with the precision necessary for so delicate an object, unless corrected for that express purpose by some observations made about the time, and it may fairly be doubted whether the necessary degree of accuracy for such observations could then be attained. If we reject this, we shall find that a mean motion of 0o.667 per annum in the direction np sf (or retrograde) will nearly represent the measures, as the following statement will show. Date.

The respective mean annual motions corresponding to which are 00.527, 00489, o00886 and o0.886. The change of distance is more than sufficient to account for the acceleration on the supposi.. tion of an elliptic orbit. The star is a very interesting one, and deserves to be narrowly watched.

Sir W. HERSCHEL saw it double on the gth April, t774, with a power of 211, and has given its measures in his first Catalogue as follows: Position 560 46' sf;b Distance i4'.50, by two years observations, from 1779 to 1781. These measures coincide so closely with our own, that no suspicion can arise of any real considerable change in this star. The following strange observation of M. FLAUGERGUES, recorded in the Connaissance des Temnps, An. xi. page 36o, is therefore the more surprising. After recounting his habitual observations of it, 184 Mr. HERtSCHEL'S and Mr. SOUTH'S observations of the apparent as a trial of his telescopes, without ever noticing its being double, he goes on to say, "Le 4 Aout, 1787, a 8 heurs du soir, regardant cette etoile avec une telescope de i, pouces, je vis avec surprise qu'elle etait composee de deux etoiles, une grande et l'autre plus petite, distante entre elles du diam6tre de la plus petite. La ligne passant par ces deux 6toiles etait dirigee a-peu-pres vers e du Bouvier." "Depuis cette 6poque j'ai observe' souvent ces deux etoiles, et j'ai reconnu que la distance entre elles augmentait continuellement. Ce progres est actuellement bien sensible et ii y a au moins quinze secondes de distance entre elles, c'est a-dire trois ou quatre fois plus que lorsque je fis cette observation. La petite etoile qui est la plus au sud a de plus beaucoup augment6 de grandeur et d'eclat." We should not have noticed this observation, which can only be regarded as an instance of the effect of familiarity, in our judgment of an object's appearance, were it not that, by a Lsingularcoincidence, the earlier observations of Sir W. H. on this very star had suggested to him a similar idea of a rapidly increasing distance.

Allowing 2"t for the apparent diameter of a star of the 8th magnitude in the 2o-feet reflector, this distance would be 5s" It is therefore probable that this star is subject to a sensible change, both in angle and distance.

Bootis continued. between the greatest and least among the single measures amounting to the enormous quantity of i6' io', and even among the mean results of whole sets of observations extending to to or tio. The closeness, and great difference of size and colour of the two stars, will partly account for this; but if we compare our measures of this with those of' Rigel, in which the difference of size'is much more considerable, and where the two stars are also very close (the distance being within 9") -we shall find reason to believe that some other cause than mnere imperfection of vision, bias of eye, or error in judgment, must have operated. There can be no doubt but that, had the micrometer been purposely deranged i6' after any measure with which the observer had been tolerably satisfied, he could not possibly have avoided noticing the change on reviewing his measure. The remark annexed to the observations of April 9, with the five-feet instrument, shows that a much less change proved intolerably offensive to the eye. Refraction, acting differently on two stars close together, and differing so decidedly in colour as these do, might be expected to produce great alterations in their relative apparent situations, but unluckily this will not account for the particular changes observed. The point requires farther investigation.

AMIcds, which is evidently much-too small ; indeed all his measures hitherto published, appear to err more or less on-.that side), the apparent relative orbit of the small star ss's", will be found not to deviate much from a strait line, the slight degree of concavity towards the large one observable in it (See fig. i, Plate IV.) being not to be depended on, on account of the uncertainty of the estimation on which the distance of 6" depends. Moreover the motion in it will be found to be not far remote from uniformity. The position ss' and s' s" being in the ratio oft i8 to 24, and the times in that of 18: 22. The obvious conclusion therefore is, that the two stars are unconnected, and the relative motion merely the difference of their proper motions; If so, both stars must have a considerable proper motion, -for the large one -(according to PIAZZI) has one which alone would carry it in the sp direction, at an angle of about 40? from the parallel (and therefore almost directly away from the small star, at the rate of about on.3o per annum.) This would explain the increase of distance, but not the angular motion. To explain both it becomes necessary distances andpositions of 380 double and triple stars, &c. 211 g Bootis continued. to attribute to the small star a motion of -o. in R.A., and, -o".0o7 in declination, those of the large one being -o".23, and -o".8. This, though very possible, is not very probable, unless we admnit a connection of some kind between the stars, and other circumstances conspire to throw a doubt on the validity of the opposite conclusion. The first is, that either the position of 1804, or that of 1792, is certainly incorrect. The observation of 1791, when taken in combination with that of the following year, shows that about that time the angle of position must have been exactly a right one, the small star then being in the act of chaning quadrants. Even with this concession, supposing the position to have been exactly north in 1791-2, and assuming this (1791.8) as an epoch, the angle described in the lo preceding years will have been 240, while in the t 1 succeeding ones it amounted to no more than 7o (up to 1803.25, the mean between the observations of 1802 and 1804) or 00.68 per annum. Yet this rapid diminution of angular velocity has not continued, for in the next 20 years, up to 1823, we find an angular motion of 130, or o.65 per annum, and taking only the observations of the last four years, it exceeds a degree per annum. These considerations indicate a considerable error, either in the measures of 1802, 1804, which corroborate each other, or in that of 1782, which is marked "' very exact." Here then we have a choice of difficulties, but fortunately a few years will enable us to decide. If the relative path of the small star be really the strait line it appears to be, the angle of position will never reach 5? np, and the angular velocity will diminish continually from the present moment. On the other hand, 212 Mr. HERSCHEL'S and Mr. SOUTH'S observations of the apparent g Bootis continued. if the stars form a binary system, the present angular velocity of about a degree per annum, will continue for some time nearly uniform, and in 15 or go years the limit of 500 np will be attained or passed. If we give up the observations of 1802, 1804, and suppose the position to have been exactly north at the epoch 1792.8, the observations, both of angle and distance, will be nearly represented by a circular orbit, described with a mean motion of 10.8 per annum., and inclined at an angle of 130 Eg to the visual ray, supposing the intersection with the plane of projection to lie in the np and sf quadrants, at an angle of 7o? with the parallel; but the data are too precarious to rely much on this conclusion. There is a small star at about ior 2 minutes distance, and at about 820 np, which is not to be suspected with the seven-feet reflector (aperture 6 inches) and can barely be discerned by rare glimpses (knowing its place) in the ten (aperture 9 inches) but with the twenty-feet it is very conspicuous. This was observed by Sir W. HERSCHEL, in 179X, to be in the same line with the two stars of i, or rather, according to a diagram made at the time of observation, a little more (30 by measurement ofthe diagram) to the preceding side of that line. It became interesting to re-observe this star, as a verification of the motion of ?. Accordingly, in the month of July last, the twenty-feet reflector (aperture 18 inches) being directed on it, E and the neighbouring small stars were seen as in fig. 2, Plate IV. The small star in question is 6, and is now decidedly on the following side of the line of junction of the two stars of i, and that by a distances andpositions of 380 double and triple stars, &C. 213 g Bootis continued. quantity nearly what it ought to be, on the supposition of the reality of the motions above attributed to the two stars. In the diagram above alluded to, fig. a; i and 2 are the two' stars offer 8' 4' 5, 6, are pretty conspicuous stars, nearly of equal magnitudes, (i. e. of the i5th or i6th) and 7 is an excessively minute star, perhaps hardly exceeding the 20th magnitude, being almost the minimum visibile with this aperture.

The change in the position of the small star here is established by indisputable evidence; the star Z being fore tunately placed at a very convenient distance to serve as a mark of reference, and nearly in the direction of the small star, being about 810 np. In 1781 it was remarked by Sir W. H. that the small star followed the line joining the large one and A, and in 1802 that it had changed sides, and preceded the same line. Our observations and M. STRUVE'S fully confirm this change. In the interval of 19.98 years between the observations of 1782 and 1802, the motion observed was a 0, and in the additional period of 20.75 years, a further motion in the same direction of 120.55 appears to have taken distances and positions of 38o double and triple stars, &c. 229 (sf p Bootis) continued. place, the distance remaining nearly the same. A more exact coincidence could hardly have happened. If this double star be a binary system, of which there can be little doubt, its period is about 622 years, and the most probable mean annual motion is 0.,5783, in the direction npsf, or retrograde. Whether this combined system have a motion in space, or not, may be perhaps best ascertained by comparing its place now, and hereafter, with u, and the data for this comparison will be found under the head of that star, as follows.

The relative positions of the large and small star appears then not to have varied (at least as far as angle is concerned) since 178i. This is a point of some importance, as the rotation of the small star (which is itself a close double star) is established by this fact. On the other hand, if the proper motions assigned by PIAZZI (o".3o in R. A. and + o'.i6 in declination) be correct, this fact would go to establish a connexion between the two stars ; for supposing the small star at rest, the space passed over in its path by the large one amounts in 40 years, to '1?".5, which being inclined at an angle of 280 to the parallel in a np direction, would subs tend at the small one an angle of li 49', a quantity which could not have escaped measurement in so distant a stareither therefore PIAZZI'S proper motions are erroneous, or the two stars have a common proper motion. distances andpositions of 38o double and triple stars, &c. 2813 Noe CCV.

STRUVE suspects the distance to have increased. An interval of I2 diameter of the small star would correspond to a central distance of' about 91Z4 or 21. M. STRUVE nea.. sured it in 1819, and found it s"D42, a little larger than ours, but his measure was taken with a projection micrometer, and may be less accurate on that account; yet on the whole 23s Mr. HERSCHEL's and Mr. SOUTH'S observations of the apparent there does appear an increase of distance. The angular velocity has undergone a considerable diminution, and as this corresponds with the increased distance, the orbit is probably elliptic, and so situated as to allow its ellipticity being visible without distortion.

In the interval of so.95 years elapsed, between 1781 and 1802, the angle described was 230.86, giving a mean velocity of 10.3g9 per annum. In the next interval of i6.86 years the angle described was 388.60, or 20.298 a year; while from 1819.6 to 182e3.83 the angle described amounted to 220,55. in 3.23 years, or 60.982 per annum. This rapid increase of angular velocity has been accompanied with a very sensible diminution of distance. In the catalogue of 1782, the interval between the two stars is described as being full il diameter of the large star, with a power of 227; while, with the same power, M. STRUVE observed them only j diameter asunder -and the same assiduous observer remarks, that the stars g Ursee and 17 Draconis, both of which are set down in the catalogues as closer than a-, are now farther asunder. Our observations corroborate this diminution of distance ; a, Coronae is now a very difficult star to separate, almost equally so with 4, and requiring the most favorable distances and positions of 380 double and triple stars, &c. 251 aCorona continued. circumstances for its measurement. Indeed the distance of the centres is less in aC than in s, a mean of 12 capital observations having given us 1".455 for the former distance on the 5th of June, 1823, while a, on the same extraordinary night, measured [1'.577; but the greater inequality of the stars of afevours their separation. To explain these phoenomena we may suppose, first, that the orbit is elliptic, and the star approaching its perihelion. But this would require a much greater variation of distance than appears to have taken place, to produce the effect, without the assistance of a second supposition, viz. that of the motion being performed in a plane passing nearly through the eye. Without therefore going into the minutiae of an elliptic orbit, let us conceive the small star to describe a cir-c cle about the large one, in a plane 3oo inclined to the visual line, and intersecting the plane of projection in the line S A which joined the two stars at the moment of the first observation. Taking the mean motion in the orbit at; 2.13 per annum, after the lapse of any number t of years from 1781.79, the angle apparently described from A, or the angle A S P will be had by the trigonometrical theorem tan. A S P _ sin 300, tan ( t x 20.13). And the angle of positionf S P will = 1o02 28'A S P. If then we calculate the apparent places by this formula for all the times of observation, we get as follows. 252 Mr. HERSCHEL'S alndMr. SOUTH'S observations of the aarent t Coronve continued. Time.

The small star observed on the ioth April will serve to verify the proper motion of A (36), which has been supposed in some way connected with the star 30 Scorpii, though at a great distance (i 2') from it, by reason of an observation of BESSEL, that they have a common proper motion. The point is a very interesting one, especially should other stars in this neighbourhood appear to be similarly affected. But our knowledge of the proper nmotiOns of the stars is lamentably deficient-or rather our ignorance respecting them is the opprobrium of modern astronomy. MDCCCXXIV.

The angles of 1779 and 178t contradict each other, but the earlier is to be preferred, as in the MS. observation the circumstance of the stars being exactly in the direction of the equatorial motion and running together along the hair is particularly mentioned. The motion of these stars appears exceedingly capricious, the diminution of angular velocity since the year i 821 being so great and sudden as almost to throw a doubt on the observations made after that time. The agreement between our measures and those of M. STRUVE in that year, is sufficient to prove that we have observed the same star, and all other observations on it were made with the utmost care, in nights selected for their clearness, &c., and when the telescope was in its best action. Had the angular distances andpositions of 38o double and triple stars, &c. 291 70 p Ophiuchi continued. motion continued nearly uniform from 1821, at its former rate of about 60 per annun, the position, at the time-of the observations of 1822, should have been 600 sf, and on the 9th of April, 1823, about 540. The notes annexed to the last set of observations contain the result of two trials made to ascertain the quantity of error the eye would bear in a single measure of this star. When purposely set, either way, 27 from the mean, the micrometer wire was found to be intolerably out of place. The corrections were cautiously made so as barely to give satisfaction, and from their readings off we are fairly entitled to conclude that no satisfactory measure can deviate above a degree, or a degree and a half from the truth, at most. 7 On the 9th April the micrometer wire was purposely set to w 3 570 sf but its position was so offensive as to be marked " shocking ;" and when set to 510 it had no appearance of ever being intended for a measure, the wire actually passing between the stars. Admitting the correctness of our measures and those of M. STRUVE in 1819, 1820, the mean angular velocities, during the several different intervals of the observations, will stand as follows: Observation of 1779 to that of iSozmean annual motion 5 . 46.

Some of the observations are more probably erroneous, but where to place the error is not so easy to determine. If it rest with us, inattention to usual precautions is assuredly not its cause.

STRIJVE'S, but the latter is only the result of a single measure ; and in the case of very close stars of very unequal magnitudes, and of opposite colours, a single measure can never have any dependance placed on it. We have instances of this kind in E Bootis, Rigel, STRUVE'S NO 4g0 &C. The distance however has undoubtedly undergone a remarkable change; in 1781 the interval with 460 was 24 D, corresponding to about 4" of distance between the centres. In 18o2 it was four or five diameters, which could hardly represent less than 7"' central distance, while it now seems again on the decrease. This agrees with; the idea of a rapid rotation of -one star about the other in a plane nearly passing through the eye, the small star being at its greatest elondistances andpositions of 38o double and triple stars, &c. 3o3 9 a Serpentis continued. gation about i802. The inference is an interesting one, as this star seems not unlikely to furnish another example in addition to those already known of a sidereal occultation, which the difference of colours of the two stars, and the rapidity of their motion, will render a most curious phaenomenon.

Its velocity is o .375 per annum, or is," in 40 years. The change observed in the angle of position of the small star is in the same sense therefore as that which would result from the proper motion of Ad the small star remaining at rest, and its quantity (reckoning from the year 1792, the observations of that year being of course to be preferred from the great superiority of the instrument employed) 15 54', is almost precisely that which such a supposition would give it (15 47), while the small decrease in the distance, since 1792, is also conformable to the same hypothesis. There is therefore every presumption: 1st, that the proximity of the large and small stars is merely apparent and accidental, no connection existing between them; and 2dly, that the proper motions assigned to a are not very remote from truth.

Although these are only estimations, and of course inaccurate, yet as this star naturally refers itself to s Lyr7, and can only be found by it, it was thought adviseable to place its description here rather than defer it.

BIANCHINI relates in his observations (Verona, 1737) that the most southern of the two stars of C Lyre was occasionally seen double by him, and sometimes accompanied with other small stars, through several telescopes, by CAMPINI and CELLIUS, of great focal length. It is also said to have been seen through a 1X feet telescope (by SHORT) surrounded by five small stars. Doubtless, in a part of the heavens so crowded with stars, numbers of minute stars may be seen near it in good telescopes ; but the division of one of the large stars into two is a fact we may be allowed to doubt.

Few stars are better determined than this, and few appear subject to less variation either in angle or distance. We may fairly regard our mean result as true to o". i in distance, and j a degree, or even less, in the angle. The angle of position deduced from the right ascensions and declinations of the stars at so early a period as BRADLEY'S observations, cannot merit much reliance. The observations of 18i6 by one of us, not at that time much practised in these delicate measurements, are not to be put in competition with the rest. No. CCXCVIII. R. A. 9I h41U ; Decl, 80431 S.

The proper motion of a is not sufficient to account for it, for this is such as would alone carry it almost directly towards the small star with a vex locity of o".634 per annurn. Were the small star at rest then, the large one should have approached it by 26".63, with a variation of the angle of position of not more than two or three degrees, and that in a contrary direction to what has actually happened. To account for the phaenomena, if the proper motion assigned to a be correct, the small star must have a motion nearly in the same direction as a, and somewhat more rapid. No. CCCIX. R.

The supposed motion of the small star is not verified. If the observations of 1804 and 1823 be correct, that of 1781 cannot be so; and vice versa, if the latter be correct, a great error must exist in one or both of the others. The measures are of the utmost difficulty. Our observations were each made without the others knowledge, and neither observer thought the slightest confidence could be placed in his measures, it being even uncertain whether the small star had really been seen at all, or in lieu of it some optical illusion. The agreement of the results with different instruments however is a great proof of their reality. No. CCCXII. R. A. 19h 5im ; Deci. 50 58' N. A Cygni. Large, white; small., decidedly blue. Position.

This affords indisputable proof of their connection in a binary system, otherwise the lapse of nearly 70 years, during which they have been observed, one of them would doubtless have left the other behind, without supposing a coincidence too extraordinary to have resulted from accident. Of the reality of this proper motion we have satisfied ourselves by a series of more than 500 micrometrical comparisons of the large star with minute stars in the neighbourhood, which will more properly be reserved for another communication. The mean angular motion, as deduced from' the micrometrical measures of 1781, 1819, 1822, (regarding the latter as perfectly correct) comes out o0.7386 per annum. The 3,68 Mr. HERSCHEL'S andMn SOUTH'S observations of the apparent 6i Cygni continued. mean motion deduced in like manner from a comparison of each of the remaining data with our mean result of 1822, comes out oo.7i96, a very satisfactory coincidence when the nature of such a mode of determination is considered, The mean or both gives a mean annual motion of o'.73o, in the direction spnf or direct. If we employ this to compute the position at the several times of observation, assuming that of 1 822 as correct, we shall have the following comparison: Date. Observed Position. Calculated Position. Error of Observation. 1753.8 54.6 nfi 557 o f 1.I 1778.0 39.0 38.1 -0.9 1781.9 36.2 35.2 1. 0 1793.6 37.2 26.7 -10.5 i8oo.o 19.7 22.0 +4 2.3 18o5.o 11.5 18.4 + 6.9 1812.3 1o.g 3.0 + '. 1 1819.9 7.0 7*5 + 0.5 1822.9 5.3 5.3 + 0.0 The errors are not greater than might be expected when we consider that the most important of them, i.5, is that of a single observation of each star by LALANDE, and that an error of 2" in the difference of declination would suffice to produce it. The mean angular motion of these stars then about their common centre of gravity is not far short of that of the two stars of Castor, while their apparent mutual distance is at distances andpositions of 3s8o double and triple stars, &c. 369 6i Cygni continued. least three times as great. This circumstance, taken in connection with the rapidity of their apparent proper motion, affords a presumption of their being much nearer to us, and renders 6i Cygni a fit object for the investigation of parallax.

A., equivalent to o".38 on the parallel, and o".oiL in declination. In 40 years therefore it should have moved 5".2 from its place in a direction almost exactly coincident with the parallel, and supposing the small star at rest, and the position of 1783 correct, the angle at present should be 7,5 38', coinciding exactly with the observed. The proper motion of this star appears therefore to be well established in fact and correct in quantity. No. CCCXLIII. R. A. a2h 16m ; Del. 6,? 50' N. 1789. 216; STRUYE, 751; 9 and 92 magnitudes.

HERSCHEL in his paper of -1804 is therefore clearly confirmed. It is remarkable that M. STRUVE uniformly places the smaller star in the n-pre. ceding quadrant, while our observations as regularly make it sp or nf, but the position is so nearly in the meridian that it is scarcely possible to perceive a bias one way or the other; and perhaps go9 n or s may be taken as the present situation without sensible error. In 42.37 years therefore the angle described is 190, giving an average annual motion of o0.4484 in the direction-npsf or retrograde. As the proper motion of ( Aquarii (according to PIAZZI) amounts to o'.173 or 7",266 in 42 years, and yet the stars of which it consists still retain the same distance and nearly the same relative situation with respect to each other; this circumstance alone amounts to a proof of their mutual connection, which their equal size corroborates, and renders it exceedingly probable that they form a binary system. distances and positions of 380 doubZk and triple stars, &c. 3 85 No. CCCXLVII.

The distance has not undergone that rapid change which Sir W. HERSCHEL surmised to take place in this star, as is evident by comparing M. STRUVE'S measure 14/'.2 5, taken in i8ig.88, with the mean of two very accurate ones in 1780.69, which gives I 1".032. Some mistake therefore must have been made in the measures It' 4+4]'2i8 in the Cata. logue of 1782, from which the motion was concluded with so much certainty.

The change of relative position in the three stars is conformable to the idea of a rotation of the two closer ones (A, B) about their common centre of gravity, the distant one (C) remaining at rest.

The apparent magnitudes also are nearly equal;* and though it is true the inequality lies the other way, yet it must be remuembered that in results so obta~ined, even an approach to coincidence adds something to the degree of proba. bility.

By fifteen observations made at Passy, by Mr. SOUTH, in April and May of the present year, the angle of position at the Epoch 1825.31 was 530 17' or 530.3, giving an apparent motion of io0.i in 2.0 years since the last observations in 1823, or 5 0.o5o per annum. This serves to render our observations of 1822 and 1823 yet more unaccountable, though it is still not easy to believe them erroneous, having been made with the greatest care. Mean while, if we take the whole interval from x82z to 1825, the assemblage of our observations gives 30,552 for the mean annual motion, so that the retardation of velocity noticed in p. 291 is on the whole satisfactorily confirmed. The distance remains nearly unchanged. Plate IV. Fig. 4,for Bassel, read Bessel. Froin the Press of W. ANICOl, C(leveland-row, St. Jwnes'.s, London,
