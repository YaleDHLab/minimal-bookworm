[20] III. A short Account of some Specimens of native Lead found in a Mine of Monmouthshire: In a Letter from Michael Morris, M. D. F. R. S. to M. Maty, M. D. Sec. R. S. Fludyer's-Street, Westminster, Nov. 5, 1772. S I R, A B O U T the middle of last July, I received three specimens of lead-ore from Valentine Morris, Esq; of Piercefield, in Monmouthshire. They were dug up in one of his fields, on making some drains, at no considerable depth; they were marked No 1, 2, 3. On reducing to powder an ounce and a half of the ore, marked No 3, in order to assay it, I perceived that several small bits were flatted by the pestle, which, on a farther examination, proved to be native lead. Though the bits of lead are inconsiderable, yet, as they are the first that have been publickly seen in England, or, that J know of, in Europe, some of the best and latest writers on mineralogy declaring that they have not met with any, I thought it my duty to acquaint the Royal Society with the fact, that the first account Read Nov. 19, 1772. [21] account of native lead may appear in the Philosophical Transactions, as well as the first account of native tin. N. B. In more than 300 assays of lead ore, I have met with nothing of the kind before. I am, Yours. &c. M. Morris. IV. Farther
