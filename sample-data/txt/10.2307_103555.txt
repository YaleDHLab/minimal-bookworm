An Account of the praeternatural Delivery of a Faetus at the Anus; communicated by Mr. Nourse, one of the Assistant Surgeons to St. Bartholomew's-Hospital; Demonstrator of Anatomy at Surgeons-Hall, and F. R. S. T H E kind Invitation I had from Mr. Giffard the Surgeon, to assist at the Opening of a Patient of his, gives me an Opportunity to lay before this Society, a Case as extraordinary, and I believe very like what Mons. Littre has given us in the Memoirs of the Royal Academy of Sciences at Paris, Ann. 1702; (viz.) where a Faetus had no other Nidus than the Ovary; and was brought forth through the Rectum. The Symtoms previous to this praeternatural Birth, the forementioned Gentleman has very faithfully drawn up; be pleased therefore to take them in his own Words. ` I was sent for about the middle of August last, to ` a Woman who then judged herself to be between ` three and four Months gone with Child; she had all ` the Symptoms preceding a Miscarriage, and upon ` touching, I found the O s Tincae somewhat dilated and ` spread, from whence I concluded a Miscarriage would ` ensue, and therefore ordered what I thought proper ` to promote it; but I was sometime after informed by ` her Husband, that although she before believed that ` she had miscarried, yet that she now thought herself ` Quick; as feeling somewhat to move within her Belly, ` agreeable to what she had perceived after former ` Quickenings. Thus it passed on for about six or seven N n n ` Weeks; (436) ` Weeks; in which Time she grew much bigger, and ` the Motion more perceptible; so that there remained ` no Doubt of her being with Child. About the third ` of October she was seized with violent Pains in her ` Belly and Back; which daily increasing, her Sister, ` by her Desire, came to me on the sixth, when I went ` to her, and found her labouring under very great ` Pains, and other Complaints like those preceding a ` Miscarriage or Delivery: But to be better satisfied, ` and to strengthen my Opinion, I passed up two Fin` gers into the Vagina, to examine by the Touch, whe` ther the Os Tincae began to open and spread. I there ` felt a large and unusual Fulness and Tension, which ` I then judged to be the Body of the Uterus sunk low ` into the Vagina, and much distending it, and extend` ing backwards, and pressing against the Rectum, so ` that the Excrements could not readily pass, neither ` could she, from its Pressure upon the Neck of the ` Bladder, freely make Water. I could not find the Os ` Tincae, although I very carefully examined all a` bout with the Ends of my Fingers; wherefore I then ` judged that the Fundus Uteri must have receded ` from its natural Position, and be bent backwards to` wards the Rectum: In which Opinion I was the ` more strengthened from the Fulness I before observed, ` stretching backwards; and therefore concluded that ` the Os Tincae must be very forward: Wherefore I en` deavoured to pass my Fingers between the Os Pu` bis and the Fulness which pressed against the upper ` Edge of the said Bone. This with some Difficulty I ` effected, and at length about two or three Inches a` bove the said Bone, I felt the Os Tincae with the ` Ends of my Fingers. The Cause of this Situation will ` more (437) ` more clearly appear in the Pursuit of this Account. ` I ordered her anodyne and quieting Medicines to re` lieve her Pain, which she was obliged to repeat at ` least every twelve Hours, with proper Cordials to sup` port Nature; and sometimes Clysters. Thus matters ` continued to the twentieth of the said Month, only ` that for some Days before, a Water tinged with Blood ` came away, as she imagined, through the Anus, and ` which she believed proceeded from the Piles, with ` which she was sometimes troubled. On the twentieth, her Husband came to me about ` six of the Clock in the Morning, telling me that the ` Midwife had brought away a Faetus, but could not ` compleat her Business; whereupon I immediately ` went to the Midwife, who upon my coming told me ` that a Faetus was protruded through the Anus; and ` to confirm it, desired me to examine, which I did im` mediately, and found the Funis Umbilicalis hanging ` out about two or three Inches beyond the Anus, ` and passing up through the same: I therefore passed my ` two fore Fingers by the String into the Anus; when ` I found about three Inches up, an Opening, as I then ` judged, into the Uterus, wide enough to admit the ` Ends of three or four Fingers, and the Funis Um` bilicalis passing into it; from hence I was assured that ` the Faetus came out that Way. I endeavoured, with ` my Fingers passed into the Opening, to bring away ` the Placenta; but as it was very rotten, it tore a` way between my Fingers, so that I was forced to ` bring it in small Pieces, and was at last obliged to ` leave a large Part of it. The Septum or Partition ` between the Anus and Vagina was entirely whole, ` and no Perforation through it. From these AppearN n n 2 ` ances (438) ` ances I then concluded that a Mortification must have ` begun in the Uterus, and so from its Contiguity ` be communicated to the Rectum; so that Nature en` deavouring to expel what was contained, and forcing ` it against this Part already mortified, and consequent` ly ready to give way and separate upon any Pressure ` made against it, produced this Opening, and the Pro` trusion of the Faetus through it into the Rectum, and ` so on through the Anus. ` There was a large Discharge of grumous Blood ` and other Substances through the Anus, which con` tinued coming away until the twenty-sixth of the ` aforesaid Month, when the Woman died about three ` of the Clock in the Afternoon. ` I should have observed that there was a Fulness ` and Hardness very perceptible, to be felt outwardly ` in the fore-part of the Belly, some distance below ` the Navel, from the Time that the Faetus came away ` to her Death; which upon opening the Body, I was ` well assured, was the Uterus forced upwards and ` forwards by a Sacculus, which being large and di` stended filled up the Pelvis; and by its Bulk pressed ` the Uterus forwards. The Faetus was perfect in all ` its Parts; but much wasted and shrunk from its be` ing some time dead; and consequently putrified.' This we thought necessary to premise an Examination of the Parts (which I have here brought) whose Appearances upon Dissection, were as follow. The Vagina, Uterus, Ligamenta Rotunda, left Ovary, Fallopian Tube, and Ligamentum Latum on that side, together with the Hypogastrick, and Spermatick Vessels on the same Side, were in a natural State. The Fallopian Tube on the right Side, we traced (439) traced from the Fundus Uteri almost to the Morsus Diaboli; where it was confusedly united with, and opened into the Sacculus hereafter to be described. The Ovary on this side with the Ligamentum Latum, was dilated into a large Sacculus of an irregular Form, extending itself behind the Uterus (to the posterior Paries of which it adhered) and passing on towards the left, was connected to that Part of the Colon that terminates in the Rectum, and the Rectum. In this Sacculus we found great part of the Placenta, and the Remains of lacerated Membranes, besides the Aperture of the Fallopian Tube mentioned before, and another aboutfour Inches in Diameter into the Middle of the Rectum: That part of the Ureter on the right Side which lies between the Ovary and the Kidney was dilated, and so was that part of the Rectum between the Aperture into it, and the End of the Colon; both which were caused from the Contents of these Canals being obstructed in their Passage.
