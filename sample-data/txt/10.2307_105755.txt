[54] Received January 14, 1768. VII. A Note concerning the Cold of 1740, and of this Year. By J. Bevis, M. D. F. R. S. I Find in my journal of astronomical observations made at Stoke Newington, in a detached or insulated observatory, whose walls were of brick and two feet thick, that during most part of the night of the 5th day of January 1739/40 the ink in my stand-dish would freeze in a few minutes, if brought within a foot of the wall; and that the surface of the water wherein the ball of the plumbline hung, for rectifying the position of my mural quadrant, was continually freezing, so that I was obliged to thaw it frequently, by pouring in hot water; yet was there a good fire in the room all the night. At 5 in the morning, of the 6th, a Fahrenheit's thermometer, made by himself, exposed to the North, stood somewhat lower than 10, that is, more than 22 divisions below freezing. This was the coldest night of that year there. Read March 3, 1768. This present year, in Brick-court, No 1, Middle Temple, the same thermometer, exposed out o'doors to the North, stood lowest on New year's day in the morning, to wit at 17, and once again at the same place; but then I am to observe that I am on that side my chambers invironed with buildings almost contiguous to the wall my instrument is hung against, wherein very probably fires were kept up, which hindered the quicksilver from sinking considerably lower. J. Bevis.
