Extract of a Letter, written by Mr. Sam. Colepress to the Publisher, containing an Account of some Magnetical Experiments; as also of an excellent Liquor made of Cyder-Apples and Mulberries. Presuming, what e're tends to the farther discovery of the Magnetick vertue, will not be unwelcome to you, encouraged by a hint, given in pag. 423. of your Phil. Transact. I shall not scruple to relate to you two or three Experiments of mine own, performed in the presence of Sir William Strode. 1. I took a Loadstone unpolish'd, which attracted but meanly; and I heated a Lath-nail glowing hot, nimbly applying the North-pole of the said Magnet to it, which quickly took it up, and held it suspended a great while, till I put down both the Magnet and Nail. 2. I took the same stone, and cast it into the Fire, letting it remain there, till it was thorow hot, altering its colour from black to red, and being (501) being red-hot, I applied the North-pole to another Lath nail cold, and untoucht before, which it took up but faintly, yet held it suspended for some time. 3. Two or three daies after, I took the same Loadstone, and found that it attracted then as strongly, as before it was cast into the Fire. Whence I inferr'd, that the Fire somewhat lessen'd its Attractive faculty, but did not deprive the Stone of it. Cyder-season approaching, I know not how to conceal from the delicate and curious Cyder-drinker (though I my self find the pleasures of all liquors in one, even that of fountain water *) the notice of a liquor as commendable,as yet rare. It is a composition of the Juyces of good Cyder-apples and Mulberries, producing the best tasted and most curiously coloured liquor, that many ever saw or tasted. Of which the experiment may be easily made by those that are furnisht with Mulberry-trees, without any considerable cost. * This Gentlemans constant drink is spring water.
