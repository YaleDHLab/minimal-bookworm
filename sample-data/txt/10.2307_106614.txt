[48] II. A Series of Observations on, and a Discovery of, the Period of the Variation of the Light of the Star marked ~ by Bayer, near the Head of Cepheus. In a Letter from John Goodricke, Esq. to Nevil Maskelyne, D. D. F. R. S. and Astronomer Royal. Read November 24, 1785. S I R, York, June 28, 1785. THE improvements which of late years have been introduced into astronomy, should be attributed not only to the diligence and accuracy wherewith astronomers prosecute their observations and discoveries, but in part also to your exertions, and especially to that kind encouragement which you have, on many occasions, afforded those who make this science their chief study; and I am happy to have this opportunity of acknowledging myself one of those who are much indebted to you in this respect. Under these impressions I thought I could not do better than to address to you the following account of a periodical variation in the star ~ Cephei, which I lately discovered. This account will, I presume, be a considerable addition to the few discoveries that have but very lately been made respecting the same subject. They may probably lead to some better knowledge of the fixed stars, especially of their constitution and the cause of their remarkable changes. My Mr. GOODRICKE'S Observations of a Variable Star. 49 My first observation was Oct. 19, 1784; and as I wished to establish the several points of the variation with as great accuracy as the nature of the subject will admit of, I have delayed sending this account till now; but as observations made through so long an interval of time must be very numerous, and would only swell this paper to an unnecessary length, I have in the following series formed a selection, chiefly of those that were made under the most favourable circumstances; and I must add, that none of those that are omitted contradict the results. From this series I have settled, that the star has a periodical variation of 5 d. 8 h. 37~1/2, during which time it undergoes the following changes: 1. It is at its greatest brightness about one day and thirteen hours. 2. Its diminution is performed in about one day and eighteen hours. 3. It is at its greatest obscuration about one day and twelve hours. 4. It increases in about thirteen hours. When it is in the first point it appears as a star of between the fourth and third magnitude; but its relative brightness does not seem always to be quite the same, being sometimes between ~ and ~ Cephei, and sometimes only equal to, or something less than, ~ Cephei, or between ~ Cephei and 7 Lacertae. In the third point it appears as a star of between the fourth and fifth magnitude, if not nearer the fifth; and its relative brightness is as follows: nearly equal to ~ and ~ Cephei, and considerably less than 7 Lacertae. The relative brightness and magnitude of those stars to which the variable one was compared, is as follows: ~ Cephei, the brightest, is between the third and fourth magnitude; ~ Cephei, VOL. LXXVI. H the 50 Mr. GOODRICKE'S Observations the next brightest, is between the fourth and third; 7 Lacertae is less than ~ Cephei, and of about the fourth magnitude; ~ Cephei is between the fourth and fifth magnitude; and ~ Cephei, which is a little less than ~, is between the fifth and fourth. A Series of Observations on the Variation of the Light of the Star ~ Cephei. 1784, Oct. 19, at 81/2 h. I thought it was rather less than ~ Cephei. Oct. 20, at 81/2 h. it was rather less than ~, and about equal to ~ Cephei. Oct. 22, at 91/2 h. less than ~, and larger than ~ Cephei; but the air was not very favourable. Oct. 23, at 61/2 h. and 11 h. less than 7 Lacertae, and a little brighter than ~ Cephei. Oct. 24, at 61/2 h. less than ~ Cephei, somewhat less than ~ Cephei, and something brighter than 7 Lacertae; strong moonlight, and air rather hazy.

I thought it still rather less than 7 Lacertae, but at 101/2 h. and 11 h. it was evidently less than it; air clear. Nov. 10, at 11 h. and 121/2 h. something less than ~ Cephei, and brighter than 7 Lacertae; clear sky. Nov. 11, at 7 h. to 12 h. a little brighter than 7 Lacertae. Nov. 12, at 7 h. and 81/2 h. about equal to 7 Lacertae. From 93/h h. to 121/2 h. it was something less than 7 Lacertae, and brighter than ~ Cephei. Nov. 13, at 61/2 h. to 11 h. only a little brighter than ~ Cephei, though sometimes it appeared equal to it. Nov. 14, at 71/4 h. brighter than ~ Cephei, and, I believe, equal to 7 Lacertae. There was a haziness about 7 Lacertae. Nov. 15, at 12 h. less than ~ Cephei, and brighter than 7 Lacertae; fine aurora borealis, but the air was very clear. At 181/2 h. ditto; but the air was not very clear. Nov. 16, at 61/2 h. and 10 h. just the same, if not decreased at 10 h.

Having, in the beginning of this paper, mentioned my intention of omitting several observations, in order to be as short as possible, I have thought it best, with the exception of one only, to leave out all that were made in January, February, and 54 Mr. GOODRICKE'S Observations and March, because they were much interrupted by the then unfavourable state of the weather. 1785, Feb. 8, at 9 h. equal to 7 Lacertae; considerably less than ~ Cephei.

June 26, at 111/2 h. a little less than ~ Cephei, and equal to, if not a little brighter than, ~ Cephei. In the above collection I find only two or three mistakes of any consequence, viz. the dates of the observations of April 7, and 8, are marked in my journal for April 8, and 9; but I have corrected them, being convinced they are erroneous: and the observation of May 10, I think, disagrees rather too much from what it ought to be by computation. The of a Variable Star. 57 The following observations were made by my friend Mr. E. PIGOTT; who, at my request, was so kind as to observe the star as often as possible, though then in an ill state of health. They are, I presume, sufficient to corroborate the variation of the star as above stated, although in one or two places there may be found some little differences between our observations. MR. PIGOTT'S OBSERVATIONS. 1784, Oct. 25, at 12 h. rather brighter than 7 Lacertae; much brighter than ~ Cephei, and much less than ~ Cephei; nearly between ~ Cephei and 7 Lacertae.

VOL. LXXVI. I At 58 Mr. GOODRICKE'S Observations At 181/2 h. much increased; rather less than ~ Cephei. Dec. 4, at 61/2 h. sometimes thought it less, and at other times brighter, than ~ Cephei. Dec. 11, at 53/4 h. less than 7 Lacertae; rather brighter than ~ Cephei. At 111/2 h. rather brighter than 7 Lacertae; not at its full brightness.

Dec. 28, at 53/4 h. nearly equal to ~ Cephei; had only a short view of them. 1785, April 26, at 111/2 h. less than ~, rather less than ~ Cephei, brighter than ~ Cephei, and if any difference rather brighter than 7 Lacertae. May 4, at 93/4 h. much less than ~ Cephei, less than ~ Cephei, and than 7 Lacertae, and rather brighter than ~ Cephei. May 7, at 11 h. rather less than ~ Cephei, and brighter than ~ Cephei.

May 19, at 10 h. equal to ~ Cephei, but if any difference rather brighter; little hazy and moon-light. The same at 12 h. but the weather was not hazy then. May 20, at 113/4 h. and 123/4 h. rather brighter than ~ Cephei, and much less than 7 Lacertae; moon-light strong at 113/4 h. May 21, at 121/4 h. equal to 7 Lacertae; less than ~ Cephei. May of a Variable Star. 59 May 22, at 121/4 h. equal to, if not brighter than, 7 Lacertae; think it brighter than ~ Cephei. May 23, at 113/4 h. seemed sometimes equal to, though generally less than, ~ Cephei and 7 Lacertae. Having now delivered the observations, from whence I have deduced the preceding conclusions, nothing more relative to this subject remains to be mentioned, except the determination of the period; in the doing of which I must follow nearly the same methods as have been used in some preceding papers. It is very evident, from a rough calculation, where only single periods or very short intervals are used, that it is about five days and eight hours. In order to determine this period with greater exactness, I have, in the following table, collated some of the most precise phases. The first five are times when ~ Cephei was observed to be equal to 7 Lacertae during the course of its increase of brightness, which proceeds rapidly. The five next are similar times, with this only difference, that as it was not then actually observed to be equal to 7 Lacertae, a proper allowance from the nearest observations was made on supposition that the changes are similar in every period. The ten last are assumed times between its least and greatest brightness, which determinations can hardly err more than a few hours, as the whole increase is completed in thirteen hours; but even were it so, the periods deduced from them would still be exact, because the intervals are very long.

What I have before mentioned, that the greatest brightness of ~ Cephei does not seem to be always quite the same, is not peculiar to this star, but is also to be observed in the other variable ones. I have remarked in a late Paper, that the greatest brightness of ~ Lyrae is subject to considerable alterations, and thought then that it might be owing to some fallacy of observation; but now 3 I have of a Variable Star. 61 I have reason to alter, in some measure, my opinion on this head. Even Algol does not seem to be always obscured in the same degree, being perceived to be sometimes a little brighter than ~ Persei, and sometimes less than it*. These seeming irregularities, however, do not appear to affect the period; for if we compare the same precise phases together, it will be found still regular. This may, I suppose, be accounted for, by a rotation of the star on its axis, having fixed spots that vary only in their size. I need not say, that the situation of ~ Cephei, on account of its great northern declination is such, that its changes may be observed with great advantage in these latitudes, it being always sufficiently elevated above the horizon. To this circumstance are also owing its various changes of position, which, I find, affect the comparative brightness of the stars a little; but, as these differences are very trifling, I shall take no further notice of them. If you think this account worthy of notice, I beg you will be so kind as to communicate it to the Royal Society. I remain, with great regard, &c. JOHN GOODRICKE. * This will appear from an attentive examination of the observations of that star's diminution in my two late Papers, which were printed in the LXXIIId and LXXIVth volumes of the Philosophical Transactions. I did not take much notice of it then, because I thought the difference was too small to be relied on; but the observations I have made since seem to confirm that it does really diminish a little unequally. M. MECHAIN, in a letter to Mr. E. PIGOTT, mentions the same fact.
