VII. Extract of two Letters, the one to Dr. William Gibbons, Fellow of the College of Physitians London; the other to Mr. Nicholas Staphorst, Operator in Chymistry at Apothecaries-Hall, from Mr. Edward Coles, giving an account of a Red Colour produced by mixture of a Sulphureous Spirit with a Volatile Alcali. I in making several Chymical Experiments found a Sulphureous Spirit, which being mixt with a Volatile Alcali, such as Spirit of Sal Armoniack, or Urin, &c. gives it a red Colour in a moment, and does the same without any effervescence, tho' both the Liquors were clear (543) clear before, wherefore considering that this Experiment might be serviceable in the demonstrating of Sanguification: I humbly offer it to your more refined Judgment, and am -In the Box is a bottle of the Spirit, you may put two parts of the Spirit to one of Spirit of Sal Armoniack, and shake the Glass or Bottle, and it will be red in a Moment, tho' the more the Glass is shaken the deeper or blacker red it will be. I suppose there is enough in the Glass for you to Experiment, and to shew to the VirtuososI made the Spirit by Distilling 2 or 3 Pound of Benzoin with a little sand in a Retort, ad Siccitatem, and put the Oil, Spirit, and Flowers altogether into a Paper Filtre, and the Spirit which came first thro' is that which I have sent. The Experiment abovementioned was tried before the Royal Society, and succeeded as above related, but the Circumstances must be diligently attended, or else it will not succeed.
