(281) IV. An Experiment to shew that some Damps in Mines may be occasioned only by the burning of Candles under Ground, without the Addition of any noxious Vapour, even when the Bottom of the Pit has a Communication with the outward Air, unless the Outward Air be forcibly driven in at the said Communication or Pipe. By the Reverend J. T. Desaguliers, LLD. F. R. S. E X P E R I M E N T I. IN a Cylindric Glass-Receiver, open at both Ends, whose lower End is plung'd in Water, and upper End cover'd with a Plate with an Hole of near an Inch Bore, a Candle of Six in the Pound will not burn quite the Time of one Minute before it goes out. E X P E R I M E N T II. A Candle will burn almost as long when the Receiver is quite cover'd. E X P E R I M E N T III. The Receiver having the Hole of the Plate open, and a Pipe at Bottom communicating with the external (282) ternal Air, will burn but a little longer than in the first Experiment; and if you blow in at the Pipe with your Mouth, it will go out rather sooner. E X P E R I M E N T IV. Blow in at the Pipe with Bellows, and the Candle will burn as long as you will.
