[420] V. Part of a Letter from Mr. Macky, Professor of History, to Mr. Mac Laurin, Professor of Mathematics in the University of Edinburgh, and by him communicated to the President of the R O Y A L SOCIETY; being an Extract from the Books of the TownCouncil of Edinburgh, relating to a Disease there, supposed to be Venereal, in the Year 1497. I F the Venereal Disease was never known in Europe till the Siege of Naples 1495, it must have made a very quick Progress through Europe in a short time; for in 1497, I find it raging in Edinburgh, and our King and his Council terribly alarmed at this contagious Distemper, as appears from a Proclamation of King James the IVth, in the Records of the Town-Council of Edinburgh. The Minute of Council is dated the 22d of September. I have taken a Copy of it for your Amusement, and, if you please, you may communicate it to the SOCIETY. I have pretty nearly observed the old Spelling, except in Numbers. Read March 17. 1742.3. `` 22.
