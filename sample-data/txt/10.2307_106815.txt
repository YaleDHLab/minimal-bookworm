t t683 SV.: Extract of a Letter from Sir Charles Blagden, Kn+. SeÂ£. R. S. to Sir Joseph Banks, Bart. P. R. S. giving some Iccount of the Tides at Naplese Read May 2 798* Rome, March 3o, I 793. lr w 1 TOOK some pains at Naples to get information about the state of the tides, but could learn nothing satisfac4f:ory. The qllantity of rise and f.all is so little7 that uniess tlae sea be very calm, it is impossible to malie a good observaEion. One of the best places for ascertaining the phnomena would/ be at what they call the river St-ys, which is a nar:cow communication between the Porto.di Miseno and the lWare Morto. Here I learned very distinctly that the water sotnetitnes ran in, and sometimes out, but could not get the ti.tnes when I was there it was running out. The best obsers7ation I had was on the 2d of March, when it appeared to be high water at Naples about eleven in the forenoon, and low water betweerl five and six in the afternoonj, with a differetlce -of pretty exactly onet foot in the height. The wirld blew the same way all the time, and the sea was very little agitated. On the preceding day the water had sunk aninch or two lower. From this observation, as well as some others less accurate, I cotleluded the time of high water at full and change to be between nine arld ten o'clock, in the Bay of Naples9 I am, &c. (:. BLAGDEN
