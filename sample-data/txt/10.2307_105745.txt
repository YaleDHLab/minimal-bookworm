[496] LVI. A Discourse on the Locus for three and four Lines celebrated among the ancient Geometers, by H. Pemberton, M. D. R. S. Lond. et R. A. Berol. S. In a Letter to the Reverend Thomas Birch, D. D. Secretary to the Royal Society. S I R, Dec. 15. 1763. M Y worthy friend, and associate in my early studies, the collector of the late Mr. Robins's mathematical tracts, thought it conducive to a more compleat vindication of the memory of his friend against an insinuation prejudicial to his candour, to make some mention of the course, I took in my early mathematical pursuits, and how soon I became attached to the ancient manner of treating geometrical subjects. This gave occasion to my looking into some of my old papers, amongst which I found a discussion of the problem relating to the locus ad tres & quatuor lineas celebrated among the ancients, which I then communicated to a friend or two, whose sentiments of those ancient sages were the same with mine. What I had drawn up on this subject is contained in the papers, I herewith put into your hands, which if you shall think worthy of being laid before our honourable society, they are intirely at your disposal. Read at R. S. 15 Dec. 1763. I am your most obedient servant, H. Pemberton. T H E P 1. C 2. C r 3. C S P T t R E R F I O F T r D S t K P T M D d E S L R V A Q N B N B A Q B D A G Q M H C 7.

Sir Isaac Newton refers the general problem to this: Any quadrilateral A B C D being proposed, to find the locus of the point P, whereby PRQ being drawn parallel to A C and S P T parallel to A B, the ratio of the rectangle contained under Q P, P R to that under S P, P T shall be given; and this by pursuing the steps, whereby he proves, that the point P will in every quadrilateral be in a conic section, may be readily reduced to the case of a quadrilateral with two sides parallel, after this manner. Draw B t and D N parallel to A C, then find the point M in N D, that the rectangle under M D N be to that under A N B in the ratio given, and draw C r M d. TAB. XXIV. Fig. 1. Here R r will be to A Q, or S P, as M D to A N, and B t, or Q P, to T t as N D to N B whence the rectangle under R r, Q P will be to that under S P, T t as that under M D N to that under A N B, that is, in the ratio given of the rectangle under R P Q to that under S P T. Therefore, by taking the sum of the antecedents and of the consequents, [498] consequents, the rectangle under r P Q will be to that under S P t, that is, to the rectangle under A Q B, in the quadrilateral A B C d, whose two sides A C, B d, are parallel, in the given ratio. In like manner, if three of the given lines passed through one point, as the lines C A, C B, C D, and the rectangle under Q P R be to that under S P T in a given ratio, this case is with the same facility reduced to the like quadrilateral thus. Fig. 2. Draw B E parallel to A C, that shall cut S T produced in t, and let the point F be taken, that the rectangle under C A, E F be to the square of A B in the ratio given; then C r F being drawn, B t, or Q P, will be to T t as A C to A B, and R r to A Q, or S P, as E F to A B; whence the rectangle under Q P, R r will be to that under T t, S P, as that under A C, E F to the square of A B, that is, in the given ratio of the rectangle under Q P R to that under S P T, and the rectangle under Q P r will be to that under S P t or A Q B in the quadrilateral A B C F, whose two sides A C, B F are parallel, in the same given ratio. Now let A B C D be a quadrilateral having the two sides A C, B D parallel, with any conic section passing through the four points A, B, C, D; also, the point E being taken in the section, and E F G being drawn parallel to A C or B D, let the ratio of the rectangle under A G B to the rectangle under F E G be given: then the conic section will be given. Fig. 3,4,5. Let the sides A B, C D meet in M, and draw M I bisecting A C and B D in K and L. Then the 4 diameter [499] diameter of the section, to which A C and B D are lines ordinately applied, will be in the line M I; and if N P, Q S are tangents to the section, and parallel to A C and B D, the points O, R, in which they intersect M I, will be the points of their contact, and the vertexes of that diameter. But the square of N O is to the rectangle under A N B, and the square of Q R to the rectangle under A Q B, as the rectangle under E G H or F E G to that under A G B, therefore in a given ratio; but the ratio of N M to N O, the same as that of Q M to Q R, is also given; whence the ratio of the square of N M to the rectangle under A N B, or of the square of O M to the rectangle under K O L, is given, as likewise the ratio of the square of R M to the rectangle under K R L. Fig. 3, 4. Now in the ellipsis the square of M O, the distance of the remoter vertex of the diameter O R from M, is greater than the rectangle under K O L; that is, the ratio given of the rectanlge under F E G to that under AGB must be greater than the ratio of the square of half the difference between A C and B D to the square of A B. But in the hyperbola the square of M O is less than the rectangle under KOL; whereby the ratio of the rectangle under F E G to that under A G B shall be less than that of the square of half the difference between A C and B D to the square of A B [a]. Fig. 4. Fig. 3. In [a] As the square of O M shall be greater or less than the rectangle under KOL, the square of NM will be respectively greater or less than the rectangle under ANB; therefore the ratio of the square of N O to the rectangle under A N B, that is, of the rectangle under F E G to that under A G B, will be accordingly greater [500] In both cases, if the point T be such, that the rectangle under M O T be equal to that under L O K, whereby M O shall be to O T in the given ratio of the square of M O to the rectangle under L O K, the given rectangle under K M L will be to the rectangle under L T K (by Prop. 35. L. 7. Papp. [b]) in this given ratio, and therefore given; consequently the points T and O will be given. Fig. 3, 4. In like manner, if the rectangle under MRV be equal to that under L R K, so that M R be to R V in the given ratio of the square of R M to the rectangle under L R K, the given rectangle under K M L (by Prop. 22. L. 7. Papp.) will be to the rectangle under L V K in the same given proportion, whence the points V and R will be given. Thus in both cases the points T and V will be found by applying to the given line K L a rectangle exceeding by a square, to which the given rectangle under K M L shall be in the given ratio of the square of M O to the rectangle under K O L, or of the square of M R to the rectangle under K R L; M O being to O T, and M R to R V, in that given ratio. But in the last place, if this given ratio be that of equality, so that the square of RM be equal to the rectangle under K R L, by adding to both the rectangle under M R L, that under R M L will be equal to that under KM, LR, and MR to RL as K M to M L, and the vertex R of the diameter greater or less than the ratio of the square of N O to the square of N M, which is the same with that of the square of the difference between A K, B L to the square of A B. [b] See pag. 511. R I Fig. 5. [501] R I will be given, the conic section being here a parabola, this diameter having thus but one vertex. Hitherto the point E, when the line E F G falls between A C and B D, is without the quadrilateral, and within the lines A B, C D, when E F G is without the quadrilateral. But when E is within the lines A C, B D in the first case, and without in the second, the locus of the point E will be opposite sections, each passing through two angles of the quadrilateral. When one section passes through A and C, and the other through B and D; then if the diameter M I be drawn, as before, and to K L be applied a rectangle deficient by a square, to which the given rectangle under K M L shall be in the given ratio of the square of M O to the rectangle under K O L, or of the square of M R to the rectangle under K R L, the points T and V, constituting the rectangles under K T L and under KVL, being thus found, M O will be to O T, and M R to R V, in this given ratio (by prop. 30. L. 7. Papp.) O and T being the vertexes of the diameter M I. Fig. 6. But the rectangles under K T L, K V L cannot be assigned, as here required, unless the ratio given for that of the square of O M to the rectangle under K O L, or that of the square of R M to the rectangle under K R L, be not less than that of the rectangle under K M L to the square of half K L; that is, when the ratio of the square of O N to the rectangle under A N B, and that of the square of R Q to the rectangle under A Q B, or that of the given ratio of the rectangle under F E G to that under A G B is not less than that of the rectangle V O L. LIII. T t t under [502] under A K, B L to the square of half AB, or of the rectangle under A C, B D to the square of A B. But if one of the opposite sections pass through A and B, and the other through C and D, the ratio of the rectangle under F E G to that under A G B will be less than that of the rectangle under A C, B D to the square of A B. For C L being drawn parallel to A B, and A D joined and continued to M, the line D M falls wholly within the section passing through C and D: therefore K M is less than K L, and the ratio of K D to K L less than that of K D to K M, that is, of B D to A B; whence B K being equal to A C, and C K to A B, the ratio of the rectangle under B K D to that under C K L, being the ratio of the rectangle under E G H, or F E G, to that under A G B, will be less than the ratio of the rectangle under A C, B D to the square of A B. Fig. 7. And here the point L is given; for the given rectangle under B K D is to that under C K L in the given ratio of the rectangle under H G E, or that under F E G, to the rectangle under A G B; hence C K, equal to A B, being given, K L is given, and consequently the point L. Again, B L being joined, and N E O P drawn parallel to A B, also G E F continued to Q, as A G, equal to C Q, to F Q so will C K be to D K, and O P to E G, equal to O B, as K L to B K, consequently the rectangle under O P, A G will be to that under E G, F Q as that under K L, C K to that under K B, D K, that is, as the rectangle under A G B to that under F E G; and by combining the antecedents and consequents the rectangle under P E N will be to that under Q E G in the same given ratio. More[503] Moreover D K being to A C as K M to C M, the ratio of D K to A C, that is, the ratio of the rectangle under BKD to the square of AC, will be less than the ratio of K L to C L, or the ratio of the rectangle under C K L to that under A B, C L; therefore, by permutation and inversion, the ratio of the rectangle under C K L to the rectangle under B K D, that is, the given ratio of the rectangle under N E P to that under A N C, equal to that under G E Q, is greater than the ratio of that under A B, C L to the square of A C. And hence the opposite sections passing through the angles of the quadrilateral A B C L, whose sides A B, C L are parallel, will be given as before. When the given ratio of the square of O M to the rectangle under L O K shall be that of the rectangle under K M L to the square of half K L, whereby the given ratio of the rectangle under F E G to that under A G B shall be that of the rectangle under A C, B D to the square of A B, the points T and V shall unite in one, bisecting K L, and the points O and R shall also unite in one, dividing the line KLM harmonically; and then the locus of the point E will be each of the diagonals of the quadrilateral. Fig. 6. In the last place, if the diagonals A D, B C of the quadrilateral were drawn, cutting G E in I and K, and the ratio of the rectangle under K E I to that under A I D were given, and not that of the rectangle under G E F to that under A G B; then the intersection of these diagonals, as L, will be in the line drawn from M bisecting A C, and B D, and the point L will fall within the quadrilateral, whereby the locus, when an T t t 2 ellipsis Fig. 8. [504] ellipsis or single hyperbola, will be assigned by the 36th proposition of the foresaid book of Pappus: and when opposite sections, by the 30th proposition, or be reduced to the preceding cases thus. Since K G will be to G B as C A to A B, and I G to G A as B D to A B, the rectangle under K G I will be to that under A G B, in the given ratio of the rectangle under A C, B D to the square of A B. Therefore when the ratio of the rectangle under K E I to that under A I D is given, the rectangle under A I D also bearing a given ratio to that under A G B, the ratio of the rectangle under K E I to that under A G B will be given, and in the last place the ratio of the rectangle under G E F to that under A G B will be given, this rectangle under G E F being the excess of that under K G I above that under K E I [c]. And thereby the sections will be determined, as before. AND thus may the locus of the point sought be assigned in all the cases of this ancient problem, which Sir Isaac Newton has distinctly explained. The other cases, he has alluded to, may be treated, as follows. When three of the given lines shall be parallel, as A C, B D, and H I, the fourth line being A B, and K E L M being parallel to A B, the ratio of the rectangle under K E L to the rectangle under E G and E M shall be given; that is, three points A, B, and H being given in the line AB, with the line GE insisting on AB in a given angle, that the rectangle under AGB shall be to that under G H and G E in a given ratio: then [c] By Prop. 193. Lib. 7. Papp. take Fig. 9. [505] take A N equal to B H, and draw N O parallel to A C, B D, and H I. Then if N P be drawn, that P O be to O N in the given ratio, N P will be given in position, and P O will be to O N, that is, E G, as the rectangle under K E L to that under E M, E G; so that the rectangle under K E L will be equal to that under PO, EM. But the rectangle under O K M is equal to the excess of that under O E M above that under K E L [d]; therefore the rectangle under O K M, or that under N A H, or under N B H, is equal to that under E M and the excess of O E above O P, that is, to the rectangle under P E M; the point E therefore is in an hyperbola described to the given asymptotes PN, MH, and passing through A and B. Again if two of the given lines only are parallel, but the rectangles otherwise related to them, than as above. Suppose the ratio of the rectangle under A G, E F to that under B G, G E is given. Let C D meet A B in L, and let H E I, M F N be drawn parallel to A B, and L K parallel to A C and B D. Then the parallelogram E M will be to the parallelogram E B in the given ratio. Take A O to O B in that ratio, and draw O P parallel to A C and B D. Here the point O will be given, and the parallelogram P A will be in the given ratio to the parallelogram P B; whence A B will be to B O as the parallelogram B H to the parallelogram B P, and as the difference between the parallelograms E M and E B to the parallelogram E B,consequently as the parallelogram G M to the parallelogram P G; therefore the ratio of the rectangle under A G, F G to the rectangle under [d] By Prop. 194. Lib. 7. Papp. E G, Fig. 10. [506] E G, E P or O G will be given; and in the last place the ratio of F G to G L being given, the ratio of the rectangle under A G and G L to that under E G, O G will be given. And thus three points A, L, O, will be given with G E insisting on A B in a given angle, as in the preceding case. Moreover, AC and BD being parallel, AB and CD may be also parallel. And then, when the ratio of the rectangle under A G B to that underG E F is given, the determination of the locus is so obvious as not to have required a distinct explanation. But when the rectangle under A G, E F bears a given ratio to that under B G, G E; let the diagonals A D, B C be drawn, and H E L K drawn parallel to A D. Then the rectangle under H E L will be to that under K E I in the same given ratio; and if C M be taken to M B in the same ratio, the lines M N P, M O Q drawn, the first parallel to A C, B D, and the other parallel to A B, C D, will be given in position, and the diagonal B M will bisect both I K, N O, and H L; therefore the rectangle under H E L being to that under K E I as M C to M B, that is, as N H to N K, here by division the rectangle under H E L will be to that under I H K [e] as NH to HK; therefore equal to that under N H and I H or K L. But the rectangle under N E O is equal to the sum of the rectangles under H N L and under H E L [f]; therefore the rectangle under N E O is equal to that under N H, N K, equal to that under A P D, that is, equal to that under P A Q, or that under P D Q, the diagonal B M bisecting both P Q and [e] By the prop. of Papp. before cited. [f] By the same. A D. Fig. 11. [507] A D. But thus the point E is in an hyperbola described to the asymptotes M N, MO, and passing through A and D. THE determination of this locus for three lines is solved almost explicitly by Apollonius in the three last propositions of his third book of Conics. For if the three lines proposed were A B, A C, B C, and the point sought D, that the ratio of the rectangle under E D F (the line E F being drawn parallel to B C) should be in a given ratio to the square of a line drawn from D to B C in a given angle, the square of which line will be in a given ratio to the rectangle under B E, C F; then if B H, C I are drawn parallel to A C and A B respectively, also B D L, C D K drawn through D, the square of B C will be to the rectangle under B K, C L as the rectangle under D F, D E, to that under C F, B E. Fig. 12, 13, 14. Hence if the ratio of the rectangle under D F, D E to the square of a line drawn from D on B C in a given angle, is given; the square of this line being in a given ratio to the rectangle under C F, B E, the ratio of the rectangle under B K, C L to the square of B C will be given; whence a conic section passing through D will in all cases be given. In the first place let the point D be within the angle B A C. Then if B C be bisected by the line A M, this will be a diameter to the conic section, which shall touch B A, A C in the points B, C, and B C will be ordinately applied to that diameter; the vertex of this diameter being N, the given ratio of the rectangle under B K, C L to 2 the Fig. 12. [508] the square of B C will be compounded of the ratio of the square of M N to the square of NA, and of the ratio of the rectangle under B A C to the fourth part of the square of B C; and thus the line A M will be divided in N in a given ratio, and the point N, one vertex of the diameter, to which B C is ordinately applied, will be given. If A N be equal to N M, the point N will be the only vertex of this diameter, and the section will be a parabola. Otherwise by taking the point O in A M extended, so that the ratio of A O to O M be the same with that of A N to N M, the point O will be the other vertex of the diameter. And here if the ratio of A N to N M be that of a greater to a less, the point O will fall beyond M from A within the angle B A C, the conic section being an ellipsis. But if the ratio of A N to N M be that of a less to a greater, the point O will fall on the other side of A, and the section will be an hyperbola. And in this case if the opposite section be drawn, that also will be the locus of the point D within the angle vertical to the angle B A C. Fig. 13. In the last place, if D be in either of the collateral angles, A M drawn as before will contain a secondary diameter in opposite sections, one of which shall touch B A in B, and the other C A in C. Then if one of these sections pass thro' D, the sections will be given. For here P A Q being drawn through A parallel to B C, the given ratio of the rectangle under C L, B K to the square of Fig. 14. [509] of B C will be the same with that of the given rectangle under B A C to the square of A P: therefore A P is given, and thence the sections. For let R S be the secondary diameter, to which B C is ordinately applied, and T the center of the opposite sections. Then the square of B M will be to the rectangle under A M T as the square of the transverse diameter conjugate to the secondary diameter R S to the square of this secondary diameter; and if a line were drawn from M to P, this would touch the hyperbola B P in P [g], and the square of A P will be to the rectangle under M A T in the same ratio; therefore the given ratio of the square of M B to the square of A P will be that of the rectangle under A M T to the rectangle under M A T, or the ratio of M T to A T; consequently the ratio of M T to A T is given, and thence the point T. But also the diameter R S is given in magnitude, the square of R T or of S T being equal to the rectangle under M T A; whence in the last place the transverse diameter conjugate to this is also given; for the square of this diameter is to the square of R T as the given square of B M to the rectangle under A M T now also given. But a more simple case may also be proposed in three lines, when the ratio of the rectangle under E D F should be equal to the rectangle under a given line, and that drawn from D to B C in a given angle. Fig. 15. This line will bear, both to B E and F C, a given ratio, and the rectangle under EDF will be in a given [g] Apoll. conic. L. II. prop. 40. VOL. LIII. U u u ratio [510] ratio to the rectangle under the given line and E B or C F. Let the line given be H, and take M B and N C, that the rectangle under M B C, and that under B C N be to that under B A and H in the given ratio of the rectangle under E D F to that under B E and H, B M and C N being equal. Then draw from M and N lines parallel to B A, C A, which shall intersect E F in K and L, whereby, M K cutting C A in I, the rectangle under M B C will be to that under B A and H as the rectangle under B M C to that under M I and H, and also as the rectangle under E K F to that under K I and H, that is, as the rectangle under E D F to that under H and B E or M K, whence by adding the antecedents and consequents the rectangle under K D L will be to the recttangle under H and M I in the same given ratio, which is also that of the rectangle under B M C to the same rectangle under H and M I: the point D therefore is in an hyperbola passing through B and C having for asymptotes the lines M K and N L given in position, the rectangle under K D L being equal to that under B M C, or that under M B N. If the two lines A B and A C are parallel, the locus may be known to be a parabola by the last proposition of the fourth book of Pappus. But if B C were parallel to one of the other, the locus will be an hyperbola, as the preceding, but assigned by a shorter process. Suppose the given lines to be A E, A F, and B C parallel to A F. And let the rectangle under E D F be equal to that under D G, and the given line H, the line E G making given angles with A E, A F. Here take E I equal to H, 1 and Fig. 16. [511] and deduct from both the rectangles that under E I or H, and D F, whereby will be left the rectangle under I D F equal to that under H and F G, both whose sides are given. Draw therefore I K parallel to A E, and the rectangle under I D F will be equal to this given rectangle, the given lines K I, A F being the asymptotes to the hyperbola passing through D. Coroll. If L M be drawn through B parallel to E F, L B shall be equal to F G, and B M equal to E I or H, whereby the hyperbola opposite to that passing through D will pass through B. S C H O L I U M. The propositions of Pappus, which have been referred to in pag. 500, 501, 504, l. 2. are given by him, among others, for Lemmas subservient to the lost treatise of Apollonius De sectione determinata, and the four here cited respect and comprehend all the cases of the problem, where three points are given in any line, and a fourth is required such, that the rectangle under the segments of the proposed line intercepted between the point sought, and two of the given points, shall bear a given ratio to the square of the segment terminated by the third point. The cases indeed of the problem, from the diversity of situation in the points given to the point sought and to one another, are in number six. The given extreme of the segment to constitute the square may either be without the other two given points, or between them. And when it is without, the point sought may be required to be taken without them all, either on the side opposite to the given extreme of the segment to constitute the square, which will be one case,or it may be required to fall on the same side, U u u 2 which [512] which will be a second case. If it be required to fall between this point and the other two, this will be a third case. A fourth case will be, when the point sought shall be required to fall between the other two points. Also when the given extreme of the segment to constitute the square lies between the other two given points, the point sought may be required to fall, either there also, or without, composing the 5th, and 6th cases. The propositions in Pappus referring to these cases, though but four in number, suffice for them all, each proposition being applicable to the problem two ways. For instance the thirty-fifth proposition, as expressed by Pappus, is this, being the first above cited. Three points C, D, E being taken in the line A B, so that the rectangle under A B E be equal to that under C B D, A B is to B E A C D E B as the rectangle under D A C to that under C E D. Now A B is to B E, both as the square of A B to the rectangle under A B E, and as the rectangle under A B E to the square of B E. Therefore if the ratio of A B to B E be given, the ratio of the square of A B to the rectangle under C B D will be given, which is the first of the cases above described, and also the ratio of the rectangle under C B D to the square of B E given, which is the second case. In both cases the rectangle under D A C will be to that under C E D in the given ratio of A B to B E. But in the first the rectangle under D A C will be given, and the point E in the rectangle under C E D to be found by applying a rectangle, which shall bear a given ratio to the given rectangle under D A C to the given line C D exceeding by a square; and in the second case the rectangle [513] rectangle under C E D is given, and A in the rectangle under D A C to be found by applying to the given line C D a rectangle exceeding by a square, which shall bear a given ratio to the rectangle under C E D now given; whence by the ratio of A B to B E given the point B will be found in both cases. The 22d proposition either way applied refers to the 3d case only, the 30th relates both to the 4th and 5th, and the 36th proposition to the remaining 6th. The 45th, and other following propositions, are accommodated to the solution of Apollonius's problem, when four points are given, and a fifth required, which with the given points shall form four segments such, that the rectangle under two shall bear a given proportion to the rectangle under the other two. The various cases of this problem appear to have been the subject of the second book of the mentioned treatise of Apollonius; and, according to the character given by Pappus of those propositions, these lemmas serve to reduce them to problems in the first book, not those above mentioned, but those, where three points being given, the rectangle under the segments included by two, and a fourth point shall bear a given proportion to the rectangle under the segment formed by the third point and a given line. For instance the 46th proposition is this; in the line A B four points A, C, E, B being given; A C D E F B and the point F assumed between E and B; G also D taken, according to the 41st proposition, that the rectangle under A D C be equal to that under B D E; if G be equal to the sum of A E, C B, the rectangle [514] gle under A F C together with that under E F B will be equal to the rectangle under G and D F. Here if it were proposed to find the point F, that the ratio of the rectangle under A F C to that under E F B should be given,the ratio of the rectangle under A F C to that under DF and the given line G would be given. But this analysis may be carried on to a compleat solution of the problem thus. If C N be taken to G in the given ratio of the rectangle under A F C to that under D F and G, the point N will be given, A C D E F B N and the rectangle under A F, C N will be to G that under A F, G in this ratio of CN to G; consequently the excess of the rectangle under A F, C N above that under A F C, that is, the rectangle under A F N, will be to the excess of the rectangle under A F and G above that under D F and G, or the given rectangle under A D, G, in the same given ratio, and in the last place the rectangle under A F N will equal the given rectangle under A D and C N. Here I have chosen this proposition in particular, because the case of the problem, to which it is subservient, is subject to a determination, when F N shall be equal to A F. And then the rectangle under AFN being equal to that under AD and CN, as CN to FN so is AF to AD, and by division as CF to FN so DF to A D; therefore when A F is equal to F N, CF will be to A F as F D to A D: consequently C D to F D as F D to A D, and the square of D F equal to the rectangle under A D C, when the problem admits of a single solution only, wherein the rectangle under A F C [515] A F C will bear to that under E F B a less ratio than in any other situation of the point F between E and B. Moreover C N is to G as the rectangle under A F C to the sum of the rectangles under A F C and E F B; therefore F N being equal to A F, when the problem is limited to this single solution, the rectangle under A F C shall be to the rectangles under A F C and E F B together as the sum of A F and F C to G, which is equal to the sum of A E and C B; whence by division the ratio of the rectangle under A F C to that under E F B, when the problem is limited to this single solution, will be that of the sum of A F and C F to the excess of F B above E F. Thus directly do these lemmas correspond with Apollonius's first mode of solution, and lead to the general principle of applying to a given line a rectangle exceeding or deficient by a square, which shall be equal to a space given. This being a simple case of the 28th and 29th propositions of the 6th book of Euclid's elements, admits of a compendious solution. Such a one is exhibited by Snellius in his treatise on these problems (in Apollon. Batav.) and Des Cartes has exhibited another more contracted in it's terms, but not therefore more useful. It may also be performed thus. If upon a given line A B any triangle A C B be erected at pleasure; then if the legs C A, C B, whether equal or unequal, be continued to D and E, that the rectangles under C A D and C B E be each equal to the given space, and a circle be described through C, D, E cutting A B extended in F and G, the rectangle under B F A and B G A will each be equal to the space given. Also if in the legs C A, C B the rectangles under C A D and C B E be each taken Fig. 17. Fig. 18. [516] taken equal to the space given, and a circle in like manner be described through C, D, E, cutting A B in F and G, the rectangles under A F B and A G B will each be equal to the given space. Here it is evident, that the space given must not exceed the square of half A B, when equal, the circle will touch A B in it's middle point. P O S T S C R I P T. AS this application to a given line of a rectangle exceeding or deficient by a square, or the more general problem treated of in the sixth book of the elements, of applying a space to a line so as to exceed or be deficient by a parallelogram given in species, is the most obvious result, to which the analysis of plane problems, not too simple to require this construction, leads; so the descriptions of the conic sections here treated of, stand in the like stead in regard to the higher order of problems styled solid from the use of the conic sections deemed necessary for their genuine solution. And these are the only modes of solution, the modern algebra, which grounds its operations on one or two elementary propositions only, naturally leads to. But as the form of analysis amongst the antients, by expatiating through a larger field, often was found to arrive at conclusions much more concise and elegant, than could offer themselves in a more confined track; the antient sages in geometry, that the solid order of problems might not want this advantage, sought out that copious and judicious collection of properties attending the conic sections, which [517] which, with some useful additions from later writers, have been handed down to us. And as the advantages of this ancient system of analysis cannot be too much inculcated in an age, wherein it has been so little known, and almost totally neglected, permit me, Sir, to close this address to you with an example in each species of problems. Were it proposed to draw a triangle given in species, that two of its angles might touch each a right line given in position, and the third angle a given point. It is obvious, how difficult it would be to adopt a commodious algebraic calculation to this problem; notwithstanding it admits of more than one very concise solution, as follows. Let the lines given in position be A B, A C and the given point D, the triangle given in species being E D F. Fig. 19, 20, 21. In the first place suppose a circle to pass through the three points, A, E, D, which shall interFig. 19. sect A C in G. Then E G, D G being joined, the angle D E G will be equal to the given angle D A C, both insisting on the same arch D G; also the angle E D G is the complement to two right of the given angle B A C: these angles therefore are given, and the whole figure E F G D given in species. Consequently the angle E G F, and its equal A D E will be given together with the side D E of the triangle in position. Again, suppose a circle to pass through the three points A, E, F, cutting A D in H, and E H, F H joined. Here the angle E F H will be equal to the given angle E A H, and the anV O L. LIII. X x x gle Fig. 20. [518] gle F E H equal to the given angle F A H. Therefore the whole figure E H F D is given in species, and consequently the angle A D E, as before. In the last place suppose a circle to circumscribe the triangle, and intersect one of the lines, as A C, in I. Here D I being drawn, the angle D I F will be equal to the given angle D E F in the triangle; consequently D I is inclined to A C in a given angle, and is given in position, as also the point I given; whence I E being drawn, the angle F I E will be the complement of the angle E D F in the triangle to two right. Therefore I E is given in position, and by its intersection with the line A B gives the point E, with the position of D E, and thence the whole triangle, as before. Here it may be observed, that the angle D of the triangle E D F given in species touching a given point D, and another of its angles touching A C, the line I E here found is the locus of the third angle E. Fig. 21. Again, in the astronomical lectures of Dr. Keil, it is proposed to find the place of the earth in the ecliptic, whence a planet in any given point of its orbit shall appear stationary in longitude, and a solution is given from the late eminent astronomer, Dr. Halley, upon the assumption, that the orbit of the earth be considered as a circle concentric to the Sun. But for a compleat solution of this problem let the following lemma be premised. The velocity of a planet in longitude bears to the velocity of the earth the ratio, which is compounded of the subduplicate ratio of the latus rectum of the greater axis of the planet's orbit to the latus rectum of [519] of the greater axis of the earth's orbit, of the ratio of the cosine of the angle, which the orbit of the planet makes with the plane of the ecliptic, to the radius, and of the ratio of a line drawn in any angle from the center of the sun to the tangent of the orbit of the earth at the point, wherein the earth is, to a line drawn in the same angle from the sun to the tangent of the orbit of the planet projected upon the plane of the ecliptic at the place of the planet in the ecliptic. Let A be the sun, B C the orbit of any planet, D E the same projected on the plane of the ecliptic, F G being the line of the nodes, B the place of the planet in its orbit, D its projected place: then the plane through B and D, which shall be perpendicular to both the planes B C and D E, intersecting those planes in B H, D H, the lines B H, D H will be both perpendicular to the line of the nodes, and the angle B H D the inclination of the orbit to the plane of the ecliptic. But tangents drawn to B C and D E at the points B and D respectively will meet the line of the nodes, and each other in the same point I, and the velocity of the planet in longitude will be to its velocity in the orbit B C, as D I to B I. Now from the point A let A K fall perpendicular on B I, and A L be perpendicular to D I: then the ratio of D I to I B will be compounded of the ratio of D I to D H, or of A I to A L, of the ratio of D H to B H, and of that of B H to B I, that is, of A K to A I. But D H is to B H as the cosine of the inclination of the orbit to the radius, and the two ratios, that of A I to A L, and that of A K to A I, compound the ratio of A K to A L: therefore X x x 2 the [520] the velocity of the planet in longitude is to the velocity in its orbit in the ratio compounded of that of the cosine of the inclination of the planet's orbit to the radius, and that of A K to A L. Moreover the ratio of the velocity of the planet in B to the velocity of the earth in any point of its orbit is compounded of the subduplicate of the ratio of the latus rectum of the greater axis of the planet's orbit to the latus rectum of the greater axis of the earth's orbit, and of the ratio of the perpendicular let fall from the sun on the tangent of the earth's orbit at the earth to A K, the perpendicular let fall on the tangent of the planet's orbit at B. Therefore the velocity of the planet in longitude, when in B, to the velocity of the earth in any point of it's orbit is compounded of the subduplicate ratio of the latus rectum of the greater axis of the planet's orbit, to the latus rectum of the greater axis of the earth's orbit, of the ratio of the co-sine of the inclination of the planet's orbit to the radius, and of the ratio of the foresaid perpendicular on the tangent of the earth's orbit to A L, the perpendicular on D I: these perpendiculars being in the same ratio with any lines drawn in equal angles to the respective tangents. This being premised, the place of a planet in the ecliptic being given, the place of the earth, whence the planet would appear stationary in longitude, may be assigned thus. A denoting the sun, let B be a given place of any planet in it's orbit projected orthographically on the plane of the ecliptic, C B the tangent to the planet's projected orbit at the point B, which will therefore be given in position. Also let D E be the Fig. 23. [521] the orbit of the earth, and the point D the place of the earth, whence the planet would appear stationary in longitude at B. Join A B, and draw a tangent to the earth's orbit at the point D, which may meet C B in F, and the line A B in G; draw also A H making with D F the angle A H D equal to that under A B C. Then the point D being the place, whence the planet appears stationary in longitude, as F B to F D so will the velocity of the planet in longitude in B be to the velocity of the earth in D, this velocity of the planet in B being also to the velocity of the earth in D in the ratio compounded of the subduplicate of the ratio of the latus rectum of the greater axis of the planet's orbit, to the latus rectum of the greater axis of the orbit of the earth, of the ratio of the co-sine of the inclination of the planet's orbit to the plane of the ecliptic to the radius, and of the ratio of A H to A B: therefore the ratio of F B to F D will be compounded of the same ratios; and if I be taken, that the ratio of A B to I be compounded of the two first of these, I will be given in magnitude, and the ratio of F B to F D will be compounded of the ratio of A B to I, and of A H to A B. Whence F B will be to F D as A H to I; and the angles C B A, or F B G, and A H G being equal, whereby F G will be to F B as A G to A H, by equality F G will be to F D as A G to I, and D K being drawn parallel to F B, B G will be to B K as F G to F D, and therefore as A G to I. But now, as this problem may be distributed into various cases, in the first place consider the earth as moving in a circle concentric to the sun, and likewise C B, the tangent to the planet's orbit, perpendicular to A B. But [522] But here D K also will be perpendicular to A B, and A B meeting the earth's orbit in L and M, the rectangle under K A G will be equal to the square of A M. But B G being to B K as A G to I, if B N be taken equal to I, B G will be to B K as A G to B N, and A B to K N also as A G to B N, and the rectangle under N K, A G equal to that under A B and I: therefore the rectangle under K A G being equal to the square of A M, N K will be to K A as the rectangle under A B, I to the square of A M, that is, in a given ratio, and K D with the point D will be given in position. Fig. 24. Again, when C B is not perpendicular to L M, let D O be perpendicular to L M. Then the rectangle under O A G will be equal to the square of A M. But B N being taken equal to I, as before, the rectangle under N K, A G will be equal to that under A B, I; whence N K will be to A O in the given ratio of the rectangle under A B, I to the square of A M, Therefore N P being taken to P A in that ratio, the point P will be given, and K P, the excess of N P above N K, will be to P O, the excess of A P above A O, in the same ratio. Hence, as D K is parallel to C B and D O perpendicular to LM, the triangle K O D is given in species, and if P D be drawn, the angle O P D will be given; for the co-tangent of the angle O K D will be to the co-tangent of the angle O P D, as K O to O P, that is, as the rectangle under A B, I together with the square of A M to the square of A M, and hence the point D is given by the line P D drawn from a given point P in a given angle A P D; and if A D be drawn, A D will be to A P as the sine of the angle A P D to the sine of the angle P D A; this angle therefore Fig. 25. [523] therefore is given, and the angles A P D, P D A being given, the angle P A D is given. Coroll. Here, where the orbit of the earth is supposed a circle, the ratio of I to A B, that is, of the rectangle under A B, I to the square of A B, will be compounded of the subduplicate ratio of A M, the semidiameter of the earth's orbit, to half the latus rectum to the greater axis of the planet's orbit, and of the ratio of radius to the co-sine of the inclination of the planet's orbit to the plane of the ecliptic; and adding on both sides the ratio of the square of A B to the square of A M, the ratio of the rectangle under A B, I to the square of A M will be compounded of the ratio of the square of A B to the rectangle under A M and the mean proportional between A M and the half of this latus rectum of the planet's orbit, and of the ratio of the radius to the co-sine of the inclination of the net's orbit. In the next place, though the earth's orbit is not a circle concentric to the sun; yet if the projection of the planet falls on the line perpendicular to the axis of the earth's orbit, the point A will still bisect L M. In this case draw to the points L and M tangents to the ellipsis meeting in P, from whence through D draw P D meeting the ellipsis again in Q, and intersecting L M in O. Here if a tangent be drawn to the ellipsis in Q, it will meet the tangent at D on the line L M in the point G. Fig. 26. Now L G will be to G M as L O to O M, and the point A bisecting L M, the rectangle under G A O will be equal to the square of A M. But B G is to B K as A G to I. Therefore B N being taken equal to I, A B will be to K N as A G to I, and the rectangle under A B, I equal to that under A G, 4 K N: [524] K N: whence A O being to K N as the rectangle under G A O to that under AG and KN, AO will be to K N as the given square of A M to the rectangle under A B and I, also given. Draw R P parallel to C B, and take P S to A P, also N T to A R in this given ratio inverted. Then will the points T and S be both given, also A O will be to K N, and R O to K T, as A R to N T, that is, as A P to P S. Therefore if T V be drawn parallel to C B, that is, to K D, and V S parallel to L M, these lines will be both given in position; and WDXY being also drawn parallel to LM, WD will be equal to K T, and R O being to K T, as AP to PS, DY will be to WD as XP to PS, and by composition YW to WD as XS to PS, and the given rectangle under YW, or SV, and PS equal to that under WD, and XS. Whence SV being parallel to LM, the point D will be in an hyperbola passing thro' P, and having for asymptotes the lines VS, VT given in position. But if~the projection of the planet fall on the axis of the earth's orbit, or the same continued, A B extended to the earth's orbit in L and M will be the axis of that orbit. If also C B should be perpendicular to A B, K D would be ordinately applied to L M; and the point R being taken, that Q being the center of the orbit, the rectangle under A Q R be equal to the square of Q M, the same will be equal also to the rectangle under G Q K; whence as G Q to A Q so R Q to Q K, and A G to A Q as K R to Q K. But, as above, B G being to B K as A G to I, and B N taken equal to I, B G will be to B K as A G to B N, and A B to K N also as A G to B N or I. Therefore if N S be taken to A B as I to A Q, by equality Fig. 27. [525] equality N S will be to N K as A G to A Q, that is, as K R to Q K; and in the last place N S to K S as K R to Q R, that is, the rectangle under S K R equal to the given rectangle under N S, Q R; whence the point K, the position of K D, and thence the point D will be given. But if D K be not ordinately applied to L M, let D O be ordinately applied to L M. Then here the rectangle under A Q R, equal to the square of Q M, will be equal to that under O Q G, and G Q to A Q as Q R to O Q, whence by composition A G to A Q as O R to O Q. But BN being now also taken equal to I, and N S to A B as I to A Q, A B will be here in like manner to K N as A G to I, and N S to K N as A G to A Q: therefore N S will be to K N as O R to O Q, and by conversion N S to K S as O R to Q R. But N S and Q R being both given in magnitude, if S P be taken to N S as Q R to P R, the point P will be given, and also by equality S P will be to K S as O R to P R; whence if R V be drawn parallel to D O, and S T to K D, both R V and S T will be given in position, one passing through the given point R, parallel to the ordinates applied to the axis L M, and the other through the point S also given, and parallel to K D or C B: also D T V being drawn parallel to M L, D T will be equal to K S and D V equal to O R, therefore as S P to D T so D V to P R, and the rectangle under S P R equal to that under T D V, consequently the point D in an hyperbola passing thro' P, and having for asymptotes the lines S T, R V given in position. Fig. 28. Y y y In [526] In the last place when the line L M drawn through the sun in A, and the projected place of the planet in B, is neither the axis of the earth's orbit, nor bisected in A, the tangents to the points L, M being drawn to meet in P, let L M be bisected in Q, and the point R taken, that the rectangle under A Q R be equal to the square of Q M, whereby P D O being drawn, the rectangle under A Q R shall be equal to that under O Q G, and Q G to A Q as Q R to Q O, or by composition A G to A Q as O R to Q O. Therefore if N B be here also taken equal to I, and N S to A B as I to A Q, A B being as before, to N K as A G to I; by equality N S will be to N K as A G to A Q, thatis, as O R to Q O. Whence by conversion N S will be to K S as O R to Q R; an d if P T be drawn parallel to C B and S V be here taken to N S as Q R to T R, by equality S V will be to K S as O R to T R and also by conversion S V to K V as O R to O T. Moreover S V will be given in magnitude, and the point V given; therefore VW drawn parallel to C B, or K D, will here be given in position. But W D X Y being also drawn parallel to R V, S V will be to K V, or D W, as Y D to X D, and Y Z being taken equal to the given line S V, Y Z will be to D W as Z D to X W, equal to T V, and the given rectangle under Y Z, T V equal that under W D Z. Therefore ~ Z being drawn parallel to R P, R ~, and its equal Y Z, being given, the line ~ Z is given in position, and the point D in an hyperbola having for asymptotes V W, ~ Z, and passing through P. Fig. 29. 4 Thus [527] Thus is this problem in all cases solved either by a right line, or an hyperbola given in position, which shall intersect the projected orbit in the point sought. For though in each case the projection of the planet has here been considered as within the orbit of the earth, the form of argumentation will be altogether similar, were the projection of the planet without. And this is agreeable to the method, I have pursued throughout this discourse, where I have always accommodated the expression to one situation only of the terms given and sought in each article; the variation necessary for the other cases, when one has been duely explained, being sufficiently obvious. In the 5th volume of the Commentaries of the Royal Academy at Petersbourg is given an algebraical computation for a general solution of this problem in the orbits of any two planets projected on the plane of the ecliptic; but with this oversight of applying to the projected orbits a proposition from Dr. Keil's Astronomical Lectures, which relates to the real orbits (a). However from the geometrical solution now given a calculation for assigning the point D may be formed without difficulty. L D M being the orbit of the earth, A is the focus, and R P perpendicular to the (a) The demonstration of Dr. Keil's proposition proceeds on the known property in the planets of having their periodic times in the sesquiplicate ratio of the axes of their orbits, which confines the proposition to the real orbits; for in each planet the periodic time through the projected orbit is the same, as through the real, though the axis in one be not equal to the axis of the other. Y y y 2 axis. [528] axis. Let this axis be a b meeting R P in c, ~ Z in d, P T in e and W V in f. Then the angle a A M is given, being the distance between the heliocentric place of the planet in the ecliptic from the earth's aphelion. Also P T being parallel to C B, the angle A T e, and consequently the angle A e T, will in like manner be given, whence the points ~, R, T, V being given, as in the solution above, the points d, c, e, and f will be given, the triangles A R c, A T e, being given in species, and similar respectively to the triangles A ~ d, and A V f. Also the rectangle under W D Z being equal to that under R ~, V T, if D K be continued to the axis in g, and D h be drawn parallel to P R, the rectangle under f g, h d is equal to that under f e, d c, and both being deducted from the rectangle under f h d the excess of the rectangle under f h d above that under f e, d c will be equal to that under g h d, so that this difference will be a mean proportional between the square of h d and the square of h g, which is in a given ratio to the square of h D, and therefore in a given ratio to the rectangle under a h b, D h being ordinately applied to the axis a b. Thus a biquadratic equation may be formed, whereby the point h shall be found, and thence the point D, whose distance from A is to h e as the excentricity of the earth's orbit to half its axis. Therefore I shall only observe farther, that here occurs an obvious question, what, in so extended a search for principles leading to the solution of any problem, as the ancient analysis admits of, can conduct to the most genuine upon each several occasion. But [529] But for this end, where commodious principles do not readily offer themselves, the most general means is to consider first simple cases of the problem in question, and from thence to proceed gradually to the more complex, as has been here done in the present problem, where the several preceding cases lead one after another to the points and lines required for the last case, wherein the problem is stated in its most extensive form.
