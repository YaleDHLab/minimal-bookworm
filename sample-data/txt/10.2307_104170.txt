Some Conjectures concerning the Position of the Colure in the ancient Sphere; communicated in a Letter from the Revd Ebenezer Latham, M. D. and V. D. M. to Dr. Mortimer, Secr. R. S. S I R, I Have an Opportunity of transmiting to you a Draught of the Constellation Aries, as it was exactly copied by Dr. White, from a Book in the fine Library of your learned Uncle Samuel Sanders, Esq; a worthy Member of the R O Y A L S O C I E T Y. I do not know whether it may not be esteemed of some Moment towards the determining the famous Controversy with respect to Sir Isaac Newton's Chronology. Dr. Halley observes *, `` That the Dispute is chiefly, Over what Part of the `` Back of Aries the Colure passed. Sir Isaac Newton `` takes it to be over the Middle of the Constellation; `` P.

For when he says, Chap. xxvi. 13. By his Spirit he has garnished the Heavens; his Hand has formed the crooked Serpent; I submit it to the Judgment of the Critics, whether it is not highly probable the Writer must have lived within that Period of Time wherein a Star of that Constellation might pass for the Polar Star: And then, if the Asterisms are supposed to be placed in some such Order as here, the express Mention that he only makes . * Hug.
