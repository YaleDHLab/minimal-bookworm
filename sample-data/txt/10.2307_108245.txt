[ 75 3 IX. On the Calculation of Attractions, and the Figure of the Earth. By C. J. HARGREAVE, B.A., of University College, London. Communicated by JOHN T. GRAVES, Esq., A.M., F.R.S., of the Inner Temple. Received January 14,-Read February 11, 1841. THE principal object of the calculations contained, in the following paper, is to investigate the figure which a fluid, consisting of portions varying in density according to any given law, would assume, when every particle is acted upon by the attraction of every other and by a centrifugal force arising from rotatory motion. To what extent this may have been the original condition of the earth, is a doubtful question; and although observation does not fully warrant this supposition of the regular arrangement of parts, it has necessarily been made the foundation of most of the mathematical calculations connected with the investigation. Before proceeding. to this problem, it is necessary to calculate the attraction of a body of any given figure, and consisting of strata, varying in their densities according to any given law; and it is in this problem that the principal difficulty lies. The elegant method of so-. lution discovered by LAPLACE is.well known; and I have followed his steps as far as the point where the equation, known by his name, first appears. In order to illustrate the nature of the deviation which I have there made, it will be necessary to mention some of the principal steps of the two methods. By means of a theorem, which LAPLACE laid down as true of all spheroids that differ but little from spheres, and the properties of the integral of the equation referred to, he was enabled to substitute the easy rules of differentiation for the more complicated inverse processes, and thus to compute the attraction of that class of figures. It has, however, been since discovered by Mr. IVORY, that this theorem is true only of spheroids of a particular kind; and, consequently, to this kind the solution of the problem is restricted. This defect, and the indirectness of his analysis, led other mathematicians to consider the question; and, in 1811, Mr. IVORY published his method, which has the great advantage of being more direct, though equally limited. The method given in the following paper does not appear to be confined in its operation to any particular class of spheroids; since the coefficients of the series, into which the required function is developed, are determined absolutely, without any reference to the form of the spheroid to which they are about to be applied. The principal change consists in the different manner of treating this partial differential equation. LAPLACE and the subsequent writers on this equation, both as applied to the L2 76 MR. C. J. HARGREAVE ON THE CALCULATION OF ATTRACTIONS, calculation of attractions and the mathematical theory of electricity, suppose the coefficients of every term of the series tobe expanded into another series of the sines and cosines of multiple arcs; and they avail themselves of the property which these terms possess of vanishing, in certain cases, when integrated between certain limits. The success of this plan, however, depends upon the restricting hypothesis above referred to, that the radius vector of the surface of the body is capable of expansion in a series of terms, each of which satisfies LAPLACE'S equation. The following method shows that the coefficient of the general term of the first series is independent of one of the variables and thus dispenses with the second series of expansions. This result I have arrived at, by first obtaining the integral of LAPLACE'S equation in its most general form, and deducing the arbitrary functions introduced therein, from' considerations which enter previous to the equation of the surface of the attracting body. These coefficients being known, it is evident that the attraction of any homogeneous body on a point within or without it may be imninediately found when the equation-of its surface is given, since it then depends only on a series of explicit and definite integrations of known functions, which can always be effected, at least approximately. From this, the attraction of a heterogeneous body, similarly circumstanced, may be found by the usual method of dividing it into concentric layers, and summing the 'several attractions of these, deduced as above. By substituting the attraction so obtained, in the equation of equilibrium of a fluid body, CLAIRAUT'S theorem is immediately deduced; and, from a peculiarity in, the functions representing the attraction, it will be seen, that the same principles with longer processes maybe carried on indefinitely, without the necessity of actually determining the precise form of those functions. The restricted species of spheroid above referred to, comprises all surfaces of rev&olution; so that it is sufficiently extensive for most practical purposes; but the integration of LAPLACE'S equation lenders the analysis more direct, and the theory more complete. On the General Problem of Attractions. 1. Let g represent the density of a body at the point (x, y, z); and let f, g, h be the coordinates of a particle attracted by the body, parallel respectively to the axes x, y, z; then, if the power of attraction be inversely as the square of the distance, the resolved part of the attraction of the body, parallel to X 15f11{(f g(f-x)dxdydz {( )2 + (g .)2 + (_) y isJ x2 ydxdyd + (g y)2 + ( -)s T v ~fff ~g(Iiy)dxdydz IV -ax)2 + (g _ yj2 + (h _ AND.-THEE FIGURE OF THE EARTH. 77 the limits of integration being determined lby the equation to the surface of the body. 2. Let V represent the sum of the products of each particle by the reciprocal of its distance from the attracted point. Then V =ffj d dy +d b and by differentiating V, we obtain the ',(-x)2+(-)2 + (h-z2}'1 well-known property +d2 + h = 0, or 4 Tr g, according as the attracted' particle is not or is within the attracting mass; g' being in the latter case the density of the attracted particle*.

This equation was not integrated; but by a skilful use of its properties, 'the problem of attractions was greatly simplified by LAPLACE. He laid down a theorem, respecting the surfaces of all spheroids of small deviation, that their radii vectores might be developed into series, every term of which would satisfy the above equation; and he also gave a method of expansion. By means of this theorem, the problem could be solved for spheroidal bodies which differ but little from spheres; but its generality has been greatly restricted by the researches of subsequent writers*, by whom it has been shown that it is true only for bodies whose radii are expressible in rational and integral functions of pi', V (lp_12) cos p', V(l (2) sin AP'. Among these are the ellipsoid and elliptical spheroid, and-a large class of other spheroids.. In these papers I have adopted a different proceeding; I integrate the equation itself generally, and determine the arbitrary functions contained in the integrals by the circumstances of the problem itself. In consequence of the peculiar, form which P. then takes, V may be found by effecting the operations indicated, which are only explicit integrations. 5. I shall now proceed to integrate this equation. Consider p and p as functions of two new variables X and Y,. to be determined from the equations, 'dX dX dp (dp + kda) dY d Y dx; (d p + Ok' d a)1 where k and k' are the roots of the equation (1 _ ,2) k2 + 1 _ 0.

But an important point yet remains to be determined. The original equation, being a partial differential equation of the second order, can only involve in its integral two arbitrary functions. But here, after X Y and 4, X have come in by two integrations, we have n integrations to perform with respect to Y. It would seem, therefore, that no constant or arbitrary function of X must be added in these integrations. MID(CCXLI. W 82 MR. C. J. HARGREAVE ON THE CALCULATION OP ATTRACTIONS, Such is not the case. At each integration a function of Xmust be added, and these functions determined by reference to the original differential equation*. 7.

From this it appears that up to terms of the 1st order, R -a (1 s sin2 I) is the equation of the curve which generates the surface of equilibrium, where the value of s depends on m, or on the velocity of rotation: but as the coefficients of higher powers of sin I may be considerable, it will be useful to find the surface of equilibrium to a greater degree of exactness. For this purpose we must introduce the fourth power of sin 1, whose coefficient will be of the second order.

The circumstance of the terms arising from the differentiation of V with respect to a vanishing, affords an easy method of extending CLAJRAUr'S theorem indefinitely, without calculating the value of V.

By differentiating C with respect to r, and eliminating N a, P a, and Q a by these three equations, we have the resolved force in r, which divided by the cosine of the angle of the vertical gives g exactly as in (23.). It is evident that this may be carried on indefinitely;, and to any order, without finding g for the next lower order. MDCCCCXLT. 0
