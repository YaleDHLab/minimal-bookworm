SO >Read Aploil , 1:79e. 1 HE followitig narrative is sllbmitted to tlae Royal Society, as containing---irl ltself some curious circumstatlves, and as hav " ing suggested the experiments afterwards to be recited. 0t1 the 13th of December, 790, arl American ship was cast away orl a sand-bank that lies in the opening of the river Mersey into tlle Irish Channe3. The crew got on a part of the wreck, where th-ey:>-passed the night; atld a signal which theSy manle beitlg discovered next day from Hillberry Island a boat went of though at a great risk, and took up the surrivors. The unfortunate men had rernained twenty-three hours on the wreck; and of fourteen, tlle original number, eleven were still allve, all of whom in the end recolrered. Of the three that perished, one was the master of the vessel ; another was a passenger who had been a naster, but had lost or sold his ship in America; the third was the cook. trhe bodies of these unfortunate persorls urere also brought off by the men from Hillberry Islandg and were afterwards interred -irl Saint D cl 2 Dr. CU^RRIE)S SccounI of theMooNicholas church-yard, amidst a great crowd of spectators. The cook., who was a weakly man, died a few hours before: the boat reached the wreckL, but the two-lllasters had been lorlg dead, and this added to the sympathy for theit loss, a curiosity to inquire into its circumstances and causes. When the following particulars came to be knowll, this curiosity was increased Both the nJasters were strong and healthy men land one of them a native of Scotland, in the flonver of lifE early inalred to cold and hardships, and srery vigorous both in body and tnind. On the other hand several of the survivors were by no means strong men, most of them were natives of the warm c]imate of C:arolina, arld what was singular enotlgh, the person among the whole who seemed to have suffered let mras a negro. Wllat is extraordinary is seldom long unaccounted for in otle way or other, and the death of the two tnasters was said <to have buen owing to their Elaving taken possession of a keg . . hich had contained cherry-brandy and which still contaix}ed the cherries,-these it was reporteds they had kept to themselves, and eaten in large quantities after the shipwreck; and this havIng produced intoxicatiotl,-was supposed to have hastened their death. Some experienced sea:nell vvere satisfied witli this account, which indeed seenzed very rational; for thCsgll spirituous liquorswmay fortify the body against the effects of heat combined with moisture) alld nzay perhaps support it for a short time under great fatigue they are) I believe, uniformly hurtful when taken under severe and con tinued cold. Pleased to see a doctrine becoming poptllar vvehich has been so ably supported by Dr. AISEN,$ alad others, I be-X See Trarlsactions ofthe Philosophical and Literary Society of Manchester, V. I; remarkable Effects of a ShiSwreck. go} liesred it might rective a striking confirmation froln this catastrophe, itlto the particulars of which I determined to examine accurately. I therefore obtained access to the survivors ofthe cresr, and from them, but more especially from Mr. AMYA1, the mate, I receilred the information which r required. In repeated conversationsfwith this illtelligent young luan, I learrlt that Capt. SCOTTY the master of l:he vessel died in about four hours after the ship struck; and that CaptDAVISON, the passenger, diecI in about sevell: but that the incident of their llaving eaten cllerries infused in brandy was entirely uzithout foundation: of this he was certain, for he saw the keg which contained the cherries, staved, svhile Capt. DAVISON was endeavouring to fill it with water to make grog for the crew; the cherries fell oll the wreck, and were immediately washed into the sea. Mrs AMYAT expressed his surl?rise at the early death of the two masters, but could not assign any cause for lt. He said there was no liquor of any kind saved, nor any sort of-food; that the whole crew vvere on an equality in all points, except that some were deeper in the waterthan others but that tlhe two masters had the advantage itl this respect for they sat on the only part of the wreck th-at was out of the sea, whereas the poor negron who escaped almost unhurt, was perhaps deepest in the sea of any. He explained this in ithe following tnanner. When the ship struck they cut away her masts to prevent her from oversetting, and after tllis she cirifted over the sand bank, into what 11e called a " swash" on tlle other sideh Here she floated, and they let go their best bower an chor. bllt it dragged, and the vessel struck again in a few mi nutes on another barlk. In this situatiorl she lay some tilXIe beating against the sand, and the sea breaking over her. In 202 DF. CURRIS S AGCOUnt: of the a little whileMr. AMYAT saw the tar barrels, which formed lier cargo, floating-tovards the latld, atld soon after the bottom parted entirely, and was carried in the same direction. Happily for the men, the part of the vvreck otl which they were lashed was held by the atlchor and floated ill the water, a snzall portiotl -of the after part of the quarter-"deck beitlg above the surface. On this sat the twovmasters, generally out of the sea, but frequently overwhelmed by the surge, and at other times exposed to l-leavy sho^rers of sleet and-snou atld to a high and piercing willd. The temperature of the air, as nearly as can be guessed, was from gO° to 3So of FAU. and that of the sea, from trials in similar circumstances, from :380 to 400. IInmediately before the two masters was-Mr. AMYST himself. As te was sitting, and the deck sloped pretty rapidlys he vveas generally up to the tniddle in the water. The situation of the rest may be supposed; some of them were up to the shoulders. Thesy were not at atly time able to change their position, but kept their legs in pretty constant rnotion to counteract the colds their arms being employed ill holding by the wreck. The master of the ship Capt. SCOTT, a native of Nortll-Ca rolina, and about forty years of age, died first. As they urere in the dark, Mr. AN{YST could not see his countenance; but he was first alartned by hearirlg him talk incoherently, like one in the deliriutn of fever. By degrees his voice dutindled into a mtltter, and his hearing seemed to fail. At letlgth he raised llimself up in a sort of convulsive motion, in which he continued a few secollds, and then fell back dead on the deck. This happened about eight in the evening; four hours after tlle ship werlt aground. Soon after thisa Capt. DAVISONX who remarkable Eyects of a SbiSwreck.203svas about twenty-eiglat, began to talk incollerently, in the same manner as the other. He struggled lelager, but died ill the same way, at about elea7en at rlight. The cook died in the forenoon of the succeeding dayo LIe was a losv-spirited man, and desponded from the begirlnirlg. All the rest held: outg as 11as been already mentiolledX though sorely pinched with cold and hunger, till they were taken up about three ill the afternoon. Mr. AMYAT said that his 11arlds and feet were svelled and numb, though not absolutely senseless; he felt a tightness at the pit of his stomach, and his ¢louth arld lip$ were parched; but what distressed isitn most was cramps in the muscles of lliS sides and hips, whicll were drawn into knots. Tllotlgh immersed irl the sea, they were all of them very thirsty; ana though exposed to such severe cold, Mr. AMYAT himself V\JAS tlOt drowsy, nor were any of the men drowsy nor d-id sleep precede death in those that perished. These facts are curious. Reflecting on the particulars of this melanclaoly story, thereseemed ne doubt that the deatll of the twso mastelOs was to beimputed to their peculiar position on the wreck. Exposedto-; heavy showers of sleet and snow they might suffer from being wet with fresh} rather than salt water e they lnight also sufferfrom being exposed to the cold of the atluosphere, probably seven or eight degrees greater than tlliat of the sea. rlhechilling eSects of evaporation might operate against theln, promoted as tliese must have been by the high wind; orthey might receive injury fron their -frequient imlnersivllsin tlle sea producillg a-rl ialternation in the media suirrounding. ThSis liaist supposition did xlot,)illdeed, strike Tne at this tilue ; the otllers vlwelt ol1 my mind. Dr. CURRIE'S Account Qf theBotOf the powers attending animation, -that which seems fulz dalnental, is the capacity o:f the living body of preservillg the -same heat in various degrees of temperature of tlie sanle me --dium, and, indeedX in media of very different density and pressure. If a definition-of life were required, it i-s on this faculty thsat it night best be founded. It is known that some fluids, applied to the-slkin, vary in their eflSects accorditlg to the-rimpregnation. In the same -degree of temperature, pure water on tlle surface of the body is lnuch tnore hurtful than wzater in which salt is dissolved. Seafaring. men are universally -acqtlainted with this, and a striking proof of the truth, as well as of the itnportance of tlle observation, may be found in the Narsrative of Lieut. BLIGH. Probably the saline impregna;tion may stimulate the vessels of the skin ill sorne vwrav that -counteracts tlle sedative or debilitating action of the cold. At Aany rate, it seemed not unliliely that some light might be thrown on this curious subject, by observing the effiects of immersiorl in fresEl and salt water, of equal temperature, oxl the -animal heat. Alld this ulight also assi$t irz accounting for tlle death of the unfortunate men already mentioned. . . E XPE R I MENT I . I placed a large vesse], contaitling one hundred and seventy gallons of salt water, in the open ai The atmosphere was damp, and what is called raw The thermometer stood at in the air, and tllis also was the temperature of the water. The subject of my experiment was RICHARD EDWARDS, a healthy man, twenty-eight years of age, with black hair, and a -ruddy complexion. The hour chosen for his itnmersion was four in the afternoona about two hou-rs after Ilis dinner; a timb remveekable Eects of a Shipare(/k.Bosappoirlted rather for my own convenience, than as being most proper for the purpose. His heat was 98° before undressing, his pulse zooe itl the minute. He was undressed i} a rooze where the mercury was at $6°; and aftersvards stood naked before the fire till llis heat and pulse were examined again, and found as before. He then walked pretty briskly througll a flagged passage into an open court, where the north-east svind blew sharply uponhim: he was exposed to it f{r a lllinote, and then plung;ed suddenly into the water up to the shoulders. The thermometer which had been kept in a jug of warm . . water, at tlle heat of 100°, was introduced into his mouth, with the bulb under his tongue as S0001 as the convulsive sobbings occasioned by the shock snJere over. The mercury fell rapidly, and a minute and a half after irnmersion it stood at 87°. He renlairled motionless in the rater, and the mercury rose gradually; at the etld of twelve minutes it stood at 3°3* While he sat itz the water, it occurred to me to exanline lliS heat when he rose out of it -into t]le air: I had reflected oz the power that must be employed to keep up his heat in a medium so dense as utater, and where an inanirnate body, of the satne bullk, would have cooled so much more speedily thaz in air of the salne temperature. Supposing that this heat-producillg process, whatever it may be, might corltinlle its operations some time after the extraordinary stimulus (the pres sure of the water) was remorred, I expected to see tlae mercury rise by the accumulation of his heat, on changing the medium of srater for air, and therefore-kept hina exposed, naked, to the wind two luinutes after takiilg hiln out of the bath. To my surprise, although the attenciants were rubbing him dry with towels during this time, the mercury fell rapidly. 11e was put into a warm bed, and his heat, svhen fexamined uxlder MDCCXCII. E e go6 Dr. CURRIE S ACCQUnT of the tI-le totlgues was 87°at-the axilla 89o. Frictions were usedy and Ebrandy mixed with water admirlistered; but I found orx this, as on all future occasiorls, that the best tnode of counteracting the cold, was to apply a bladdery svitl:o hot watery to the pit of the stomach (the scrobiculus cordis), a fact whicll I think important: this : being done, his shi-veringsy vvhich be-fore were severe, soon ceased, and he became mqre com-fbrtable. Three hollrs afterwards however, he had not entirely recovered EliS Xformer heat, but hy eight at night,he was m all respects as usual. . . I have beetl very minute in detailing the c-ircumstances under which this experiment was made; some of the partictllars which, at the time, I thought of little consequence, I found afterwardsof importance. The experimerlt itself I deterrllined to repeat as exactly as posslblee EXPERIMENT Ile. On the next daya at the same hour, the same person wa$ again imulersed, as before.

A draught of ale was given him and he was put into a warm bed; in three minutes after the mercury rose to 9gg. An hour afker . 9 his heat was 9S * The etiects produced by this alternate exposure to water and air of the same temperature, gave a new direction to my thoughts, and determitled me to inquire again illto this singular phaenornenon. The most obvious method would have been to have prolonged the process; of alternation, and replunged the person cooled by the es.ternal air into the bath; but this vas runnirlg too great a risk, unless some lnore sudden atld certain method could be fbund of restoring the heat tTlat might be lost.

At such times the thermorneter was taken out of EDWARDS'S tnouth, to admit of his answering the questions put to him. He said, that on plunging into the water he felt an extreme -cold, hich he could not but think wasZ partly OWiR1g to his being exposed, naked, to the wind be£ore; that this cold diminished, and in a little while he felt comfortable, but that after a while the sense of coldn&ss returned, though less than at iRrst; diminishing again, but in a less degree. At length his sensatiorls became pretty fixed. In this state, when the water was at rest, be should rlot even have known, by his feelings from the upper part of llis chest to the pubes, that he was in water at all His feet and legs vwrere very cold ;4 so were his hands and artns; and so-also the perlis and scrotum. He mentioned, likewise, that lle felt a cold circle round the upper part of his body, though not constantly On examining into this, I fbund it was greatest at first, and that it extended over the space which) frotn the undulationsK left in the bath by the plunge of immersion3 wtas alternately above arld under the surface of the w-ater: wherl the bath settled, it was little felt; but hy agitating the fluidy I could ret produce it, at any time when the cold inthe extremities was not so great as to yevent its being felt This curious parti Dr. CURRIE'S Account ef tbeoallar serves to explain a circumstance much dsvelt on by Mr. AMYAT, in giving an account of his sufferings on the wreck, that what he felt most searerely was the cratnps in the muscles of his hips and cides, parts-whicil, from his situation on the wreckg already described, mllst have been alternately under and above the surge. Here I must observe, that the sea did not break over the su*erers all the time they were on the wreck. The wind moderated, as well as tlle waves, and for the last fifteen hourss they were llOt at any time overwhelmed or atSleast Mr. AMYAT himself was not. The cold never abated. Being all lashed to the eck, they never changedl their positions; the bodies of those who died occupied l;he space where they were originally placed. Mr. AMYAT, therefore, dtlring the whole titne sat nearly up to the middle in watern but subject to the variations occasioned bX the motio of the sea. To return.-When exposed naked to the wi:nd, the rnercuryX in this cases sunk as usual five or six degrees, and his shiverings were great. Desirous of restoring his heat as$peedily as possible, we incautiously heated the hot bath to 104o: bUt aFter being half a IninUte in it, he SCrEamed OUt with painX especially in his extremities, and about his scrotuna.

RICHARD EDWARDS, the origirlal subject of experiment, was again immersed in the: cold bath, of the temperature of 4o°^ and remairled in it three quarters of an hour. His heat previously was 97°; his pulse go in the sninute. The mercury b.s * . fell to 92°, was stationary for a few minutes, and then mounted, thou$h, as usual, with no regularity. In twellty-two minutes it stood at 96°; it then began to decline, and in twenty-three minutes more had sunk to 94°. Being exposed as usual to the wind, the mercury sunk as usual, and he shivered violently. In the warmsbath at g6 his shiversngs continued sereral minutes, his heat remaining at go and 91°. In seven mi nutes the mercury began to rise fastX and five minutes after was at 96°. remarkable EfXects of a SbiSwreckeEXPER IMENT v I I * The effects of forty-Eve lminutes itunzersion in the cold saltX 1:) water bath, at 4oo, were proposed to be tried on RICHARD SUTTON. He was lnUcll under the itnpressions of fear, arld his heat previously raised the mercury only to 94t. The Inercury sunk, as usual, on his immersion, but to all urlusual degree It did not stop in its fall till it got to 83°, which perhaps mig;ht be in part accounted for by the extraordinary chattering o£ his teeth, admitting some contact of the air. It then mounted in the usual irregular \97ayv and at the end of thirteen minutes had got to 9g. Here it stood for nineteen rninutes longer with little lrariatiotl; at the end of this time it began to fall rapidly, though irregularly, and in three minutes was down at 85°. He had nosr beell thirty-five minutes in the waterX and I did not thillk it safe to detain him longer; we there fore 11urried: him into a warm bath, heated to 96°, where he shivered much. The bathwas heated .gradually to log° and in this heat he recorrered his proper temperature in abouttsrenty-eight minutes. Being then put into a warm bed, he fell into a profuse perspiration, which left him in his usual health. One general remark will serve for the pulse in all these ex periments. It was not possible to keep the subjects of them from some degree of previous agitation, and this always quickerled the pulse. The natural pulse of EDWARDS was about 70 irl the m:itlute; but it may be observed, that it was never slower than 845 before immersion, axld generally more. lIowever this might be it invariably sunk to 6aS, or from that to 68, in the water, beca;ne fir3n, regular, alld small. After being long in the bath, it could hardly be felt at the wrist, bllt MDCCXCIIG F f Dr. CURRIE?S Sccount of tbe214the heart pulsated with great steadiness and due force Irl the last experiment, when the heat surlk rapidly, SUTTON said that he felt a coldness and fai:ntness at his stomach, which he had not perceived before, and when I felt the motion of his heart, it was feeble-and languid. In some future trials of the eiSects of immersion in fresh water (one of which I shall detail), the same coIdnessat the -stomach preceded a rapid fall of the mercury; and these facts, together with the effects I found from applyilag a considerable heat to this part hell the body was chilled vvith cold, convince me that there is solue peculiar connection of the stomach, or of the diaphragm, or both, wlth the process of animal heat. Whoever will consider tlle rapidity with which a dead body would have cooled irllmersed in water of the temperature of 40°, may form sonle estimate of the force with which the process of animal ileat must hav-e acted ill the experiments already recited. These experiments, hovever, furnish irrefragable proofs of the futility of some of the theories of animal heat. The increase of heat, irl fever, has led some persons to believe that arlimal heat is produced by, or immediately connected vith, the action of the heart and arteries; here, however, it may be observed, that while heat must have been generated in the bath with more than fourfold its usual rapidity, the vibrations of the arterial system were uxlusually slowO Another, and a very beautiful theory of anirnal heat, supposes it immediately to depend on respiration; but in the bath, after the first irregular action of the diaphragm from the shock of immersion was over, the breathing became regular, and utlusually slow. Lastly, the curiotls phaenomenon of the heat rising, and falling, arld risillg again, in the bath, with the body at rest, and the temperature remarkable Eyects of a SliSpwreck.21.sof the surrollndirlg medium unchanged, is, I think, fatal to those theories of animation which consider the living body as a mere machine, acted on by external povvrers, but not itself originating actioll, ancl differing from other machitles only in the peculiarity of the powers which are fitted to set it in motion. I have said that the temperature of the mediuln cotltinued unchanged, but it may be supposed that the bath was lleated a little during the experiments; it was so; butbeing exposed, with a large surface, to the opetl air, the svind blowing briskly over it, itstheat was little altered; in twelve mi nutes immersion it had gained nearly orle degree, and in fortyfive tnillutes, the longest duration of any of the experiments, it had gained three degrees. As this accession was regular, if it had been greaterj it would not have invalidated the foregoing observatiorls. Many other trials were made on the effects of immersiort ilo water on the human heat, which I shall speak of generally, under the general corlclusions which they suggested. The experiments already recited, suggested to me the notion that irl all changes from one tnedium to another of diffierent density, though of the same temperature, there is a loss of animal heat. I found, however, that this conclusion requires many restrictions. 1. My experiments being made on bodies of such very different density as air and: water, do not admit all universal inference of this sort. 2. Being all made in a temperature fifty degrees 1lnder the humala lleat no certain conclusion can be drawn as to what night happen in degrees of heat mucll higher, whereit IS probablen the effiects of the change, if it appeared at all might lve Ffg Dr. CURRIE s Account of the21Dless striking. It would seem, however, that after a person is long chilled in cold water, the first effect of passing through the external air into the warm bath, is first a fallof heat in the air, and after this a still greater fail in the warm baths followedX -however, by a speedy rise. --> The air and the vjrater being equally cold, arld both 4t or under, I found the loss of heat in passing from the one to the other to be regulated in the following way. . If, instead of being exposed nakesd to the urind previotls to irnmersion in the waterg the body svas kept warm by a flannel coverillg the rnercury fell mtlch less on the first plunge. 2. If, after plunging illto tlle water, the person continued in it only a minut:e or two, a subsequent fall of the luercury did not alwars take place, on his emerging into the air. On the contrary there was sometimes a rise on such occasions in the mercuryg, especially iit the atmosphere was at resti g. In one irastance, after continuing in the water fifteen minutes, on rising intv the air in a perfect calm, though during a frost, there was little or no seeming ditninution of the heat; vYhile exposure under similar circumstances) nvith a north-east wind blowing sharply, though the air -as many degrees svarmer, produced a rapid dimillution. The effects of the wind i-n dimilaishitlg the huluan heat are indeed striking, and are not in my opinion explailaed by the common suppositions. 4. The loss of heat by a cllange of meclia, depends much on the rapidity of the change, for the plastic power of life in varying the process of animal heat, so as to accommodate it to the external changes, acts for a time with great celerity, though t;his celerity seelus to dinzinish with the strengthO rentarkable IEffects of a ShipwreckeEXPERIMENT VIII. I placed in a large room, svhere the mercury stood at g6° two slipper baths at the distance of six yards fronl each other. Orle was filled with cold salt-water of the temperature of 5°, tlle other with water heated to 96O, which was my onvn heat. Undressing myself in an adjoining rootn by a fire, I afterwards slipped on a loose flannel dress, and descerlded slozvZy into the cold bath, wllere I: relnairledtwo m-inutes; I ascended slowly into the-air, and then sunk myself in the wearln bath, where I remained two minutes also: I returned to the cold bath, where I staid two minute-s as before, and removed frolm it again to the wartn bath. But during all these chaklges of media and tenlperature, the thermometer svith its bulb under lny tongue never varied from 96O. I attribute this partly to the heat of my body being ill some degree defended by the flannel dress, partly to the calm of the air, but clniefly to the slowness of motion in these changes. It may be said that the time of staying in the d-iSerent baths was not long enough to produce any sellsible change in the heat of circy hting fluids of such a mass but th-is is not collsistelat xvith malay of the other facts. . The irlfluense of tlit application af coldwater to tlle surface of the body on the heat, is in some respects regulated by t-he animal vigour, as the follosvingx experiment ^rill show E XPE R I M-ENT IS § . In the same room-I placed a large elnpty vessel: in this tsvo young men sat cIonvnill succession, each oZith the bulb of a thermoneter under his tongue. A luan s-tandirlg on a bencll Dr. CUR\RIE s Accou«t: of tbe:218.mTith a bucket of cold salt-water containing four gallonsy poured the whole on tlae head atad shoulders, sulffieriilg it to run davvll on the rest of the body. This process took up nearly a minute durings -hlch I examilled the mercury, and found it unchanged. They were both directed to continue sittirg svithout motion for a minute after, during which, in both instances, the lnercury rose two degrees. A third, lnuch inferior in vigour, submitted to the same experimerlt, alld the mercllry continued during the ausion of the water unchanged, but in a minute after sunk half a degree. Irl fevers, where the heat is generally increased from two to six degrees aborre the standard of heaTth, polarilig a bucket of cold water on tile head always reduces the pulse ill freqviency, and columonly lowers the heat from two to four or five degrees. Of this saw lutary practice I hope SOOl1 tO speak at large to the public. 6. The pover of the body in preserving its heat under the impressiotls of cold, and the changes of temperature, and of media, seems in sonae measure regulated by the condition of the mindt That fear increases the influence of cold, and of many other noxious powers, will llOt be doubted ; but the state of the mitid to whicil I allude, is that of sigorous czttention to other objects. 'lthis, it is urell ktiown, will to a certain degree deaden, or, itideed, prevelat the selasation of cold; alad what does this, I apprellend, -prerrents, or at least n7eakens, its physical actioll. The astronomer, intent oll the objects of his sublime sciencen it is said, neither feel.s, tlor is injuloed by, the damps nor the chillness of the night; and in some species of madness, where the ideas of iluagination are too vivid to admit the impressions of sense, cold is resisted to an extraordinary degree. I have seen a young womanX once of the greatestf retnarkabte Efficts tf a Ship@-r-eck9delicacy of frame, struck with madness, lie all night on a cold floor, with hardly the covering tliat decency requires, when the water was frozen on the table by her arld the milk that she u1as to feed on was a mass of ice. 7th. rrhere are particular condi-t;ions of the atmosphere, not perfectly unclerstood, that seem to have an influece irl depriving us more slJeedily of our animal heat, than otllers w}were the cold is greater. It may seem that by this time I had renounced my intention of tryitlg the effiects of immersioll ill fresh water on the animal powerss atld particularly oll the heat. Some trials I have, however, made, of vwthich I shall orlly relate the folOWltlgx EXPERIMENT X.

The wind vas llow in the west, so that in the court where the bath stood there was a perfect calm. As I had some fears of the issue of this experiment instead of exposing him for a minute naked to the wind before immersion, he was covered with a flannel-dress from the air till tlle instant he descended into the water, into which he was suSered to sink hi1nself slowly, witll the bulb of the ther-2 motneter under his tongue These are important circum stances The following table e;xhibits the resuIt9 Dr CURRIE S Account f tbeImmediately on immersiona s rsnz4 lnin after, 1,5 16S-1y, 18, of 21n 22, 23 2Z 25 26' 27 28z, 2:9 So S 32 33 34heat o96 j 96 96heat_ _ 981 minute aftez g minutes 3 4 t , 7, 8 9 so ., 11F llv IS, 1.3r 9 7 2 97 98 972 g6 90 f 99 97 * aXL /95 94 _ 93 I 94 94 _ 92 oHe now got out into the air very slosvlyX and stood in it three minutes the wind not blowing on hitn.

I mean to try sorne of these experitnents to a greater extellt oal the brute creation, when I have procured thermometers better suited to my views. The thertnometers I enlployed-llad not a suffilcient mobility for very nice experiments? allcl I am well aware tllat in particular illstances this nay have misled rne, though the gelaeral results, wllicll is all that is of itnportance irl such eAxperiments as these, will, I hope, be found just alld true. Before I concltlde, I must offer a few obserarations on tlle subject that led to these experilnents. . It is, I thinli, aIready well krlosvll among sealueIz, that vsthere there is only the choice of being vwet with salt or fresh svater, it is always safest tQ prefer the first Ill the lleavy showers of rain, llail, or snosv by vvllich gales of wind are ge nerally accompanied, the men t}lat must be exposed to them, ouglat, like Lietltenant BLIGH and his crew, to vritzg their clothes out of salt-water. . In all cases where men are reduced to such distress by shipwreck or otllerwYise, that they can only chuse betweetl tlUle alternative of keeping the l;mbs constatltly ilutnerged in the sea, or of expositlg them to the air while it rains or $1]0WS, OF thetsea is at t-ilnes uashing over tlaem, it is safest to prefe< a constallt immersion; becausen in the laorthern regions where tlae cold becomes dallgerous to life, the sea is almost always war-mer than the air, as the experiments of Sir CHARLES DOUGI,aS shew; arld because there is not only a clallger from tlle illcreased cold produced by evaporation, but also from the loss MDCCSCIIO G g Dr. CURRIE S Account of tbeof heat by the rapid changes of the stlrrounding medillm, as the foregoing experiments point out. . NVhether, in high and coldzwinds vvithout rain or snow, and where a situation may be chosen beyond the reacll of tlle vaves, it is safer to colltintle in the air or to seek refuge in the sea, must depend UpOll several circumstances, and cannot perhaps be certainly determined. The motives for choosng the sea svilI be strorlger in proportion as the wind is high andcold, and in proportion as the sllore is bold. . \ The foregoing narrative shosvs that men may survive twen ty-three hours immersiola in the sea, of the temperature of g8° or ato°(as great a cold as it almost ever possesses) without food or water, and almost without hope of relief; but; that any man ever survived an equally long exposure to the higller degrees-of cold of the atmosphere, ill the same circumstances3 does not appear. Though in the case related, immersion in water did notV prevent thirst, yet there is no doubt that it alleviated it, a circumstance of high importance touards tlle pre wrvatioti of life. Liverpool, I)ecember 2s, 1 79 t . P. S. I have purposely avoided any reasoning on the causesof the loss of vital heat on the change of media in the experiments recited It may be supposed that during immersion, the water immediately in colltact with the skirl having become heated to a certain degree, the naked bodya on rising from it into the air, was in fact exposed to a colder medium, and thus the loss of heat, in this instance, produced. My examination o-f the heat otf the vvater during immersion not KenSarkAble EWeC!S OS a SZJ1SZVrEC*.^2QSluving been lnade in contact with the body, I vYill not deny that there is some foundation for the retnark; and the cases) it must be allovved, are by no rneans exactly parallel between imtnersion ill an open vessel, llonvever large and immersiotl ixl the sea, svhere tlle constarlt urldulation may be presu-med to occasion a contirlual change in the surrounding fluid. But whatever allowallce tnay be made for the circumstance mentionedv I am perslladled that tlle diXerence betweerl the density of air and water being considered, it is llot sufEcient to explaill the loss of 11eat in the lnstallce allu(led to. The changes Of tetnperature in the living body are governed by laws pe culiar to it-self I have found, in certaitl diseases, greater and $uddeller variations than any mentiorled, from applicatiolas of cold very gerltle in degree and momentary in duration. It1 his masterly s; Experiments and Observatiorls on Anitnals producilig Heat,}' Mre HUNTER has objected to takirlg the heat of the lluman body by introducing tlle bulb of tlae ther ulolueter into the mouth, because it lnay be affiected by the cold air ill breatllislg. The olqjectioll is well founded if tile bulb be placed on the upper surface of tlie -tonguen but if it be under it and tlle lips shutX the eSects of respiratioll may be disregarded, as I have foulld from many 11undred experiments. The heat may be observed in tlais way with ease and certainty, by employillg thermotneters curved at tlaat end tc) which tlle bulb is affixed (the bulb being introduced at the corner of ttle mouth) sotne of which have been made for nle by Mr. ITAM8DEN according to a form given, as well as others -on Mr. HUNTER'S plalz. From repeated trials it appears to me tllat hen the usual-elothing is on, the heat of the lisring lsody may be takenn with llearly the same result and eclual L -Gg M Dr. CURRIE'S Account, &c.224certainty, under the tongue with the lips shut, at the axilla with the arm close to the side, and in the hollow beteteell tlle scrotum alsd tlle thigh; every other part of the surface is liable to variation and uncertainty. It is evident that of tllese three methods, tlle first only can be elnployed (as far as I can discon7er) wherl the trunlr of the body is iminersed in water; and even vxhen the naked body IS exposed to the cold air-, the first metilod seems the best, the heat remailling rnost steady under the tongue: tlle axilla is thenext best in orcler, and the worst, tlle lovirer part of the groin; for the scrotum and the parts of generation lose their heat otl the application o:f cold more speedily perhaps than a21y other part of the bodyX the extremities not excepted.
