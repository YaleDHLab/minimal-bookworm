DeJecription of a Hydropneumatic Baroscope. By JOHN T'IIOMAS COOPER, Esq. Communicated by WILLIAM THOMAS BRANDER, Esq., FRItS. Sfc. Received January 28,-Read February 21, 1839. THE principle on which tthe instrument I am about to describe is constructed, is, that the volume of a given quantity of air under a constant temperature, is inversely as the pressure to which it is su!jected; and the means I employ to estimate the change of volume which that quantity of air undergoes, by being subjected to differences of pressure caused by a change of elevation, are the determination of the difference of weight which a floating body is capable of sustaining in both situations. Thus, if a vessel containing a quantity of air and water be floated in water, and there be a comnmnunication between the water in the floating h ody and that in which it floats, it will follow, that when such an apparatus is subjected to diminished pressure, the air within the float will dilate, and cause a volume of water equal in amount to the dilatation of the air to be driven fiom the float; and the difference of weight which the floating body will sustain, will be the exact weight of the water expelled: if such an apparatus is subjected to an increased pressure, the air within it will contract and consequently a quantity of water, fioro that in which it floats, will enter the float, and the diminished weight it is capable of sustaining will be the weight of the water which has entered the float, in consequence of the diminution of the volume of the air. It is by such means, with the instrument immediately to be described, and by the help of a very simple calculation, that I propose to determine the difference of level between any twco places. Plate X. fig. 1. represents the floating part, made of thin sheet brass, the body of which (a), in form the frustum of a cone, is nine inches long, two inches in diameter at one end, and one inch at the other, and capable of containing about fourteen cubic inches. In the centre of the widest end, a small stud of brass (b) is hard soldered, into which a brass wire (c) is screwed, an inch and three-eighths long, and about one twenty-fifth or one thirtieth of an inch in diameter: the other end of the wire is screwed into a brass stud in the middle of the convex side of a shallow cup (d), made also of brass, and as light as possible, so that it will retain its shape, and be capable of sustaining a weight of about eight hundred or one thousand grains. At the lower and smaller end, a projecting rim (e) of brass is soldered, for the purpose of pouring out a portion of water fromthe interior with less risk of spilling; and into this end is screwed a brass plugf, which is required to be made of sufficient weight to sink the instrument 'in water with one hundred or one hundred and twenty grain'4 3 I2 426 MR. COOPER'S DESCRIPTION OF A HYDROPNEUMATIC BAROSCOPE. in the cup at the upper part, when it contains ten cubic inches of air. To the miiddle of the brass wire I affix a very small quantity of red sealing-wax (g),i melted on it at that part, to serve as an index. Thiough the centre of the brass plug, a small hole (h), about the same diameter as the wire, is to be drilled which forms a communication between the water in the inside of the float and that in which it floats. The reason I prefer the form of an inverted frustum of an acute cone is, that the greatest portion of the weight being considerably below the centre of gravity, causes the instrument to float with greater stability, and also enables it to carry tnore weight in the cup, without inelining to either side. Fig. 2. is a representation of another part of the instrument, w[hich serves as the case for containing the float, without any chance of its becoming injured, anti at the same time retains the quantity of water necessary to render it buoyant. It consists of an inner vessel (i) made of thin sheet copper, nearly of the same form as the float, I)ut somewhat larger in all its dimensions, being two inches and three quarters in diameter at top, one inch anti three quarters at bottom, and eleven inches and 'a half deep; this is surrounded by a cylindrical case (k) of tin plate, three inches in diameter, and fourteen inches long. About three inches from the upper part of the outer case, are four holes (1) three quarters of an inch in diameter, having small hoods (n) of tin plate soldered over them, to prevent in a great measure the wind from blowing into them. The inner copper vessel is secured to the outer cylinder of tin plate by soft solder; and both are firmly soft soldered, water-tight, to a thick circular plate of brass (n), in which a circular hole (o) is turned, a little more than two inches in diameter, for the purpose of readily allowing the float to pass through it. In the inner edge of this circular hole a female screw is cut, in order that it tnav be closed either by a screw plug, or by the bottom of the brass box (p), which serves to carry the requisite grain weights. Across the top passes a piece of thick iron or brass wile (q), bent into the form of a loop, answering the purpose of a handle for carriage, or for suspending it. Fig. 3. represents the elevation and plan of a small spirit lamp (r), requisite, when an observation is to be made, to bring the water and the float with the water and ailr it contains always to the same temperature. Tlhe lamp is fixed by mneans of three wires (sss) into the middle of a rim of tin plate (t) rather smaller in diameter than the outer cylinder, and consequently allowing it easily to slip in, and there to be Secured by three small studs with bayonet-joints. An open space or interval is left between the lamp and outer rim for the free admission of air necessary for the combustion of the spirit, three small balls (v) serving as feet, upon which the instrument rests, so as to admit sufficient air beneath. Fig. 5. represents a vessel of copper or tin plate, capable of containing 2525 grains of distilled or rain water, having, at its open extremity, a piece of strong glass tube cemented, upon which a mark (w) is to be made with a file or diamond, at the place occupied by the surface of the water when it contains the above quantity, at the tempercature of 620 FAHR. The mode of adjusting the instrument I have next to describe ; it is as follows AIR. COOPER'S DESCRIPTION OF A HYDROPNEUMIATIC BAROSCOPE. 427 having unscrewed the plug h (fig. 1.), the float is first to be filled with rain or distilled water, and then as much water is to be pouredl out as will fill the measure (fig. 5.) to the mark on the glass tube: ten cubic inches of water having been thus abstracted firom the float, the same volume of air will supply its place. If this operation be carefully performed, the same quantity of air within two or three hundredths of a cubic inch will always be admitted, which may be proved by the instrutments sustaining nearly the same weight in the cup: the plug may then be screwed into its place. The next step of the operation is to fill the inner conical vessel (fig. 2.) with rain or distilled water, and to bring it, by means of the lamp, to the temnperature at which it is determined that all the observations are to be made. Presuming that the instrument will be principally employed, for the purposes intended, in the summner season, I would recommend the adjustment and all observations to be made at the temperatu re of 750 or 800 FAHR. The float is next to be placed with its smaller extremity uppermost into the warmed water, that the air andI water which it contains may acquire the desired temperature. I tnay here remark that a thermometer capable of showing at least a quarter of a degree on FAHRENHEIT'S scale Iouglt to accompany the instrument under all circumstances, when experiments and observations are to be made. As soon as the float and its contents have acquired the requisite heat, (which may take from four to five minutes) the finger is to be placed over the small hole in the plug; thoen quickly withdrawing the float and replacing it inverted in the same vessel, it is adjusted for use. In order to find the altitude by the weights to be applied in the cup, which may be conside ed as its scale a long series of experiments has been made, of which the following is an abstract. The float, after being adjusted as above described, was placed in a cylindrical glass vessel containing water at 750 FA-R. the laboratoiy being kept at the samne temperature during the time occupied by the experiments, which was generally from an hiour to an hour and a half; and weights were then added to the cup, till the ins trinent was adjusted so that the index on the middle of the wire was coillcident with the surface of the water. One hundred grains were then put into the cup, which caused the instrument to sink to the bottom of the glass vessel; and no rlore, water was allowed to be in the glass, when the instrument had so sunk, than would stand a quarter of an inch above the mark on the wire. The cylindrical glass vessel was then placed on the plate of an air pump, and a barometer capable of reading to the math of an inch, having a cistern four inches diameter, attached to the smalle plate. The barometer was first read off and noted; a receiver was then placed over the vessel with the float, and exhaustion slowly made, until the float gradually rose from, the bottom of the glass vessel, and the index on the stern coincided with the surface of the water. rThe barometer was then again read off and noted. A smuall portion of air being now let into the pump by the screw for that putrpose, the float immediately sunk to the bottom. The screw, which allowed the admission of air, being made tight, the operation was repeated; and this was done a third time if the observations of the baI Q^ 428 MR. COOPER'S DESCRIPTION OF A HYDROPNEUMATIC BAROSCOPE. meter differed. more than two or three thousandths of anl inch: a mean of the three readings was taken for the correct one. The air was now admitted into the pump, and the receiver removed, when the barometer rose to its original elevation, unless any change of atmospheric pressure had occurred during the interval, which was seldom the case; but when it did happen, a mean of the two was taken. The same operation was gone through with 200, 300, 400, 500, 600, and 700 grains, the last weight being about as much as the instrument would steadily carry on the cup without showing a tendency to overbalance. Care was taken to remove froin the glass vessel an equivalent portion of water on the addition of each 100 grains, otherwise it would have risen so high in the glass as to come in contact with the bottom of the brass cup, and thereby have frustrated the experiment. Having given a general description of the instrument and mode of adjustment, I mtay now refer to fig. 6, which represents the apparatus in use, and wvhich shows the difference of the level of the water in the interior of the float, and that which is exterior to it. Although the instrument contains ten cubic inches of air when sub,ected only to the atmospheric pressure, it will contain somewhat less than that quantity, by being pressed upon by a column of water, equal to the difference of the tvo levels, which is about fivre or six inches. The following Trable exhibits a series of experiments made with the air-pump, and the altitudes deduced from the barometrical depressions, calculated according to the formula and tables of Mr. BAILEY.

COOPER'S DESCRIPTION OF A HYDROPNEUMATIC BAROSCOPE. As an example of the application of the instrument to the determination of the height of one station above another, we will suppose that, having adjusted the instrument in the manner already described, it is found that 118 grains are required to be placed in the clip, in order to sink the float so that the index on the stein shall coincide with the surface of the water, when its temperature is 750 FAHR. Having noted these particulars, returned the weights into the box, and screwed it into its place, we then proceed to the other station, the altitude of which is greater. Here the water is first brought, by means of the lamp, to the same temperature, 750, and then weights are put into the cup, until the instrument floats at the same mark; and we will suppose it requires 274 grains to effect this: then 274 118 156 grains, the difference of weights supported. In Table 1. 150 gives . 10 594 In Table IL. 6 gives . 8 10,586 which multiplied by . . . 156 63'5 16 52930 10586 gives . . 1651 416 feet for the difference of altitude between the two stations. As another example, suppose that at the first station it requires 112 grains to sink the instrument to the mark, the temperature being as before 75?, and we then descend into a mine where it req fires, at the same temperature, only 48 grains to bring it to the same position; then 48 112 64 grains, the difference of weights supported: this is minus, because the weight at the second station is less than at the first. In Table I. 60 gives 10-873 In Table II. 4 gives + 5 10-878 which multiplied by .. . 64 43512 65268 gives .696,192 fleet for)X the depression of the second station belowg the first, MR. COOPER'S D)ESCRIPTION OF A HYDROPNEUMATIC BAROSCOPE. 431 As a last example, I will give the following, which will in some degree serve to show the application of the instrument to the measurement of comparatively small quantities, and the amount of reliance that may be placed on the observations made with it and also on the formula. From the ground floor to the attics of my house it requires as nearly as possible three grains to be added to the cup to balance the instrument. If we now take from Table I. the number answering to 0 .l.... . 10-793 andl subtract from it the number answering to 3 in Table II . . . . 4 10'789 multiply by the difference of weights ..... ................ 3 the product gives the height .........................-32-367 feet whereas by actual measurement it is 31 feet. The delicacy and sensibility of the instrument are, however, such, that if it be very nicely adjusted to a tenth of a grain, it will readily show a difference of elevation of three or four feet.
