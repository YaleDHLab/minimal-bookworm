83] IX. Experiments to determine the difference in the number of vibrations made by an Invariable Pendulum in the Royal Observatory at Greenwich, and in the house in London in which Captain KATER'S experiments were made. By Captain EDWARD SABINE of the Royal Artillery, Secretary to the Royal Society. Communicated by the President and Council. Read December 11, 1828. THESE experiments were made in compliance with a wish of the Council of the Royal Society, expressed in the following minute, dated December 13th 1827 : "That Captain SABINE be requested to ascertain the difference in the number of vibrations of a pendulum between Mr. BROWNE'S house 'in London and the Royal Observatory at Greenwich." The invariable pendulum employed to accomplish the proposed object was of the usual materials and form, new for the occasion, and numbered 12. The thermometer was the same that I had used in my former pendulum experiments; its graduation is described in the volume containing the account of those experiments, pages 182-187. The ball of the thermometer was suspended at both stations midway between the knife edge and the centre of the weight of the pendulum. The height of the barometer in the observations at Greenwich was taken by the standard barometer of the Observatory, which is in a room on the same floor as the pendulum room: inthose at London it was taken by Mr. BROWNE'S barometer placed in the room in which the observations were made. Mr. BROWNE'S barometer being compared with the standard of the Greenwich observatory, by means of an intermediate portable barometer, was found to require a correction of + 0.066 to make it agree with the indications of the Greenwich standard corrected for capillary action. This correction is consequently applied. The pendulum was first' employed in experiments in Mr. BROWNE's house from the 17th to the 20th of March inclusive: the rate of Mr. BROWNE'S clock M 2 84 CAPTAIN SABINE ON THE DIFFERENCE IN THE VIBRATIONS by CUMMING was furnished by himself. The observations are detailed in the r1Table A. at the close of the paper :-the following abstract exhibits the results: London; March 1828; Experiments with Pendulum 12. Barom. Therm.

The mean result is 85963.60 vibrations in a mean solar day, the pendulum being at 620, the air at 620.5, the barometer 29.952 inches, and the mercury 320. To reduce this result to the number of vibrations which would have been made had the pendulum vibrated in a vacuum, I have introduced for the first time a reduction obtained by direct experiment; namely, by vibrating the pendulum alternately in the air and in a rarefied medium very nearly approaching: to a.vacuum. The particulars of this experiment I hope, shortly to communicate to the Royal Society; and may state in the mean time as its result, that the barometer being at 30 inches, the mercury at 32', and the air at 450, a pendulum, similar in form and materials to the one used on the present occasion, made 10.36 vibrations per diem less than when vibrating in a vacuum. To adapt this reduction to the variations which the meteorological instruinents undergo in different experiments, it will be remembered, that the specific gravity of air varies directly as the height of the barometer, and inversely as its expansion of T -uth part of its bulk for each degree of FAHRENHEIT. The reduction.. in the present case, for barometer 29.952 inches, and thermometer 620.5, is + 9.97; making 85973.57 vibrations at 620. OF A PENDULUM AT GREENWICH AND LONDON. 85 In May the temperature in the room assigned by the Astronomer Royal for pendulum experiments, which is the western half of the quadrant room, having arrived nearly at the same height as during the experiments in London, a corresponding series was made at Greenwich on' the 15th, 17th, 18th, and 19th of May, and 5th of June. The clock employed was one belonging to the observatory, made by GRAHAM, and was fixed against the south wall: its rate was supplied by Mr. THOMAS GLANVILLE TAYLOR, assistant at the Royal Observatory, by comparisons with the Greenwich transit clock, accomplished in the manner described in the memorandum B. annexed at the close of the paper. I am also indebted to Mr. TAYLOR for his zealous cooperation in these and the subsequent experiments at Greenwich: the observations made by him are distinguished by his name in Tables C. and F: the abstract of the results in Table C. is as follows: Greenwich; May and June 1828; Experiments with Pendulum 12.

The mean result is 85964.17 vibrations in a mean solar day, the pendulum 86 CAPTAIN SABINE ON THE DIFFERENCE IN THE VIBRATIONS being at 620, the air at 580.92, the barometer at 29.580, and the mercury 320. The reduction to a vacuum is + 9.92, making 85974.09 vibrations in a vacuum at 620. We have thus the vibrations of this pendulum at London and at Greenwich as follows. London ...... 85973.57 Greenwich .... 85974.09 Difference . .. . 0.52 Showing an acceleration at Greenwich of 0.52 parts of a vibration per diem. Now as the latitude of the Royal Observatory is 2' 28" south of Mr. BROWNE'S house in London, and as its height above the sea is also about 50 feet more, a retardation from these causes combined of about 0.3 of a vibration per diem was to have been expected at Greenwich, instead of an acceleration of 0.52 of a vibration. The result appeared therefore sufficiently remarkable to make it desirable to verify it by repetition. The pendulum having remained at Greenwich a few days after the experiments were completed, the knife edge became slightly corroded with rust, in consequence of the great damp which prevails in the observatory at that season. The knife edge having been ground and figured afresh, the pendulum was again conveyed to Portland Place, and the experiments (Appendix D.) made with it on the 8th and 9th of July, the thermometer employed being the same as before, and suspended in a similar manner: the results were as follows. London July 1828; Experiments with Pendulum 12. Barom. Therm. July 8. Mean of 7 exp. 29.670 72.07 85955.42 vibrations at 720. July 9. Mean of 7 exp. 29.490 71.73 85955.40 vibrations at 720. 29.580 71.9 85955.41 vibrations at 720, The height of the barometer corrected to the standard and reduced to 320 is 29.533 inches. The mean result being that the pendulum, having had its knife edge ground and figured afresh, made 85955.41 vibrations at 72?, equivalent to 85959.71 OF A PENDULUM AT GREENWICH AND LONDON. 87 vibrations at 620, the temperature of the air being 710.9, the barometer 29.533, and the mercury 32'. The reduction to a vacuum is + 9.63, making 85969.34 vibrations at 62'. The second series at Greenwich was commenced on the 21st of July, and continued to the 26th, both days included. The clock and thermometer enmployed were the same as on the former occasion; the rate of the clock was supplied by Mr. THOMAS GLANVILLE TAYLOR, by comparison with the transit clock of the observatory, as shown in the memorandum E. The experiments are given at length in the Table F, and their results collected in one view are as follows. Greenwich, July 1828; Experiments with Pendulum 12. Barom. Therm. Vibrations at 62'.

The mean result is 85959.96 vibrations in a mean solar day at 620; the temperature of the air being 61.5, the barometer 29.446, and the mercury 320. The reduction to a vacuum is + 9.82, making 85969.78 vibrations at 620. We have thus a second series of the vibrations of Pendulum 12 at London and Greenwich, after its knife edge had been ground and figured afresh, as follows. London..... 85969.34 Greenwich.... 85969.78 Difference.... 0.44 Showing an acceleration at Greenwich of 0.44 of a vibration per diem. Tile former result was an acceleration of 0.52 of a vibration per diem. We may therefore assume finally, 0.48 of a vibration per diem as the difference in 88 CAPTAIN SABINE ON THE DIFFERENCE IN THE VIBRATIONS the rate of an invariable pendulum between the Royal Observatory and Mr. BROWNE'S house in London; the pendulum vibrating quicker in Greenwich than in London. The retardation computed for the difference in latitude between the two stations is 0.15 of a vibration per diem, and for their difference in elevation being about 50 feet and employing Dr. YOUNG'S co-efficient of .6, is 0.12 of a vibration per diem. The sum of the two computed retardations is 0.27; which added to the acceleration 0.48 shown by the experiments, makes altogether 0.75 of a vibration per diem; by which amount the result of experiment differs from what would have been anticipated, supposing that no previous experience had existed of the occurrence of such anomalies. With regard to the fact, of the existence of this irregularity between Greenwich and London, it is one which admits of easy verification by persons who may be disposed to repeat the experiments: the stations are convenient and close at home; and the magnitude of the irregularity is such as to preclude uncertainty, since with proper precautions, it is not difficult to determine the relative rates of an invariable pendulum to nearly Ith of the present irregularity. With regard to its cause,-having already expressed the opinion that I had been led to form on the occurrence in my former pendulum experiments, of what I believe to have been irregularities of a similar nature,-it is unnecessary now to repeat that opinion; and having since seen no occasion to alter it, on the contrary much to confirm it, I gladly leave the discussion to others whose opinions are entitled to more weight.

These circumstances, combined with the steady going of the clock before and since this period, seem to justify the taking -0.54 as a mean rate for the whole time; which has been accordingly employed with the following comparisons in the determination of the rate of the clock used in the experiments.
