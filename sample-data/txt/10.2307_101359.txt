An Extract of a Letter written by Mr. John Templer June 16. 1673. containing some Observations upon a pleasant way of catching Carps. -ON Thursday last, Sir Justinian Isham invited me to walk with him to his Fish ponds, and to see a boy throw out Carps with his hands at any time in the heat of the day. I saw four very large ones, that the boy took. His way was this: He waded into the Pond, and then returning to the sides, he would grope them out in the Sedg or weeds, and, tickling them with his fingers under the belly, quickly remove his fingers to their gills, and throw them out upon the land. And this he did not in a narrow but large pond, of half an Acre of ground, or rather an Acre.In which practise I must note two or three things,that seem observable to me; 1. Carps (and I suppose all other fish that keep near the bottom) keep alwayes in a shoal, although happily there may be more than one company, answerable to the difference of their Sexes; as in Deer at some seasons. 2. When they move from one place to another, they raise the mud in the heat of the day; and you may easily observe, what (6067) what road they travel, by the muddy ~ near the bottom of the water, and that so certainly as you cannot easily miss of covering the greatest part of them with a cast-net; as I have formerly been shown by Mr. Ferdinando Pulton of Desborough. 3. (What I would most observe;) The boy knows, when he is upon the Carps layer (if I may use that term,) by the warmth of the water; and when he finds that heat in the water, though he neither see nor feel any Carps (in the middle of the pond,) he immediately repairs to the sides to pursue his game. I am, &c.
