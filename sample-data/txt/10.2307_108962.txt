[ 861 ] XXVII. On the Expansion by Heat of Metals and Alloys. By A. MATTHIESSEN, P.B.S. Received June 20,-Read June 21, 1866. IN a memoir "On the Expansion by Heat of Water and Mercury"*, I described a method of determining the expansion of bodies by weighing them-in water at different temperatures. This method was chosen on account Qf its yielding accurate results with comparatively small quantities, for to purify large quantities of metal wouldentail immense labour and expense; so much so, in fact,.that to purify sufficient quantities to. make bars for the determination of the linear expansion would be practically impossible. On determining the expansion of the metals by this n method, I fo und that they did not expand regularly between 0? and 100?. The difference, howev r, between therates of expansion between 0? and 500 and 50? and 1000 was found to be so great that part of it might be possibly attributed to errors in the determination of the coefficients of expansion of water, as the 'coefficients of expansion of the metals are comparatively small when compared with those of water. Now, although the coefficient of expansion of mercury when determined by this method agrees with REGNAULT'S value, yet on account of this value being large, small errors in the water coefficients will not materially influence it; for the volume of water at 40=1L0000, at 100?=1-04316, that of mercury at 0=_1 0000, at 100?=1*0I815, and that of copper, for instance, at 0?=1 00000,, at -1Q4?=10049.98, showing that the expansion of copper is very small compared with that of water or mercury. This fact led me to make another series of check experiments by determining the linear expansion of a certain copper bar, as described in the first part of my paper above quoted, and then weighing a piece of it, turned to the shape of a double cone, in water at different temperatures. The following are the results obtained with' the copper bar; and it may here be mentioned that copper does not behave in one respect like glass. The glass rods, as there shown, do not return directly to their original length after being heated to 1000 and cooled rapidly; copper, however, does so;for no differences in the coefficients were observed after heatingthe rod to 100 ,.determining its expansion, allowing it to stand over night, and redetermining the coefficients.* Philosophical Transactions, 1866, Part I.MDCCCLXVI. 6 A 862 DR.

And taking the length of the rod at 0?-1804, it will be at 500=1805 4575, at 1000=1808.0260. From these values the linear expansion of the copper rod can be expressed by the formula Lt-1804(1 +0 00001555t+0 0000000122t2), or for any length of this sort of copper the formula for the correction of the linear expansion for temperature will be L,=LO(l +0 000001555t+0'00000-00122t2)I and that for the correction of the cubical expansion Vt=V0(1 + 000004665t + 0-0000000366t2).

The values given in the third column express the volume of the copper in cubic centimetres, and are deduced from the observed loss of weight in water W, as described (p. 245) in thepaper already quoted.

This memoir may be divided into two parts: I. On the Expansion by Heat of the Metals.: II. On the Expansion by Heat of Alloys. I. On the Expansion by Heat of the Metals. The metals employed for these experiments were purified in the manner described in a former paper *, and cast in a. well-smoked mould, which gave the casting the shape of a double wedge, as shown in fig. 7 t.# Owing to the action of the water on some of the metals and alloys, the castings had in some cases to be varnished or gilded, the latter method being more generally used. To prove that the gilding or varnishing had no influence on the results, some of those metals on which water has no action were varnished or gilded in the one series and not in the other (Series Nos. 3 and 4, 14 and 15, 11 and 12). The disposition of the apparatus and the method of observation was the same as described in the paper "On the Expansion of Water and Mercury." Sometimes observations were made commencing at the highest temperature, and cooling down without boiling out the water between the determinations made at the different temperatures. (The series made in this manner will be headed once boiled.) At others the observations were first taken at the lowest temperature, the water reboiled, then those at the highest temperature, and afterwards on cooling those at the intermediate one (twice boiled). And again, at others the water was reboiled between each. set of observations (thrice boiled). It may be as well to point out some of the causes of failure in this method of deter-* P]hilosophicad Transactions, 1860,,p. 177. t Philosophical Transaction.s, 1866, :Plate XX.6A2 '864 DR. A. MATTHIESSEN ON THE EXPANSION mining the coefficients of expansion; for although it appears a very simple one, yet it requires, I may say, very great care to ensure reliable results. I. Very often a series was rendered valueless by small hairs or particles of dust falling into the water and attaching themselves to the fine platinum wire, as 0-1 or 0 2 milligramme difference in the weight makes a considerable difference in the expansion of those metals or alloys which have a low coefficient of expansion; this source of error, was carefully guarded against; in fact if on taking the cylinder out to reboil the water any particle of dust floated near the wires, the observations were considered worthless, and fresh ones taken after reboiling the water. II. When, for instance, the observations were being made at the highest temperature, if by chance the temperature sunk three or four degrees and gradually rose again, the air absorbed at the lower temperature would be expelled, and an air-bubble would sometimes attach itself to the metal and cause a false weighing. II. If the casting were not perfect, or were crystalline, and the air could not be completely expelled from the small cavities by boiling, results were obtained which did not agree together, owing to its expansion at the high and partial absorption by the, water at the lower temperature. For this reason two series were always made with each metal and alloy, and where possible they were recast. The values obtained when weighing the purified metals in water were as follow:TABLE III.-Cadmium. Owing to this metal becoming crystalline at about 800, four observations were made between 00 and 100?. It will be seen that this change of molecular condition has no effect on this physical property. No. 3.-Cadmium four times boiled. Loss of weight T. in water=W. W(1+at). Calculated.

It is well known that alloys crystallize much more readily, in most cases, than the component metals, and not always in the same form. The difference between the observed and calculated values obtained for the alloy Bi Pb2 is so great that I thought some error had occurred in making the alloy; I therefore remade it, redetermined the coefficient of expansion (Series No. 42), and obtained the same values. That the gold-tin alloys haveIlower coefficients of expansion tlhan those of the mean of the component volumes of the metals BY HEAT OF METALS AND ALLOYS. 877 forming them is not surprising, as in all probability there exist chemical combinations between the two metals,-just as it may be said that the speck/ic gravity of an alloy is approxirmately eqal to the mean specific gravities of the volumes of the component metals, so also from the foregoing we may deduce that the volume which an alloy will occupy at any temperature between O and 1000 is approximately equal to the mean -of the component volumes of the metals at the same temperature, or, in other words, the cubical or linear coefficients of expansion by heat of an alloy between 0? and 100 are approximately equal to the mean cubical or linear coefficients of expansion by heat of the component metals.

Their values deduced, with the help of the data given in this paper, would not be correct, as for the present research the castings were made more with the idea of producing a perfect surface than an absolute solid; no doubt many of them had MaDccCLXVI. 6 c 878 DR. A. MATTHIESSEN ON THE EXPANSION internal cavities owing to the -surface being rapidly cooled, and for this reasonI have not.given the absolute weights of the metals or the alloys. It is worth remarking that the. observed specific gravity of the alloy Bi Pb2 differs considerably-from the calculated one. From the conclusions just drawn' it would appear that the determinations of the expansion by heat of alloys give in general no indication as to their chemical nature, and',that this property belongs to that class of physical properties which does not indicate. their chemical nature. In the Report on'the Chemical Nature of Alloys*, I have shown that, from the determinations of the electric conducting-power of alloys, we may gain an insight into their chemical nature; and basing my calculations on the hypothesis there propounded, I am at present able to deduce the conducting-power of any alloy which may be considered as a solidified solution of the one metal in the other,. although it may differ widely from that calculated from the mean conducting-power of the component metals, as shown in Table XII. It is proper to point out that the coefficients given in Tables IV., V., VIII., and IX., are those calculated from readings of the ordinary mercury-thermometer, the mercury being contained in a tube of glass. Therefore, except at the two values 00 and 1000, the temperatures indicated by the degrees of the thermometerI used will differI. From the temperature corresponding to the same number of degrees of an airthermometer. II. From the'temperature corresponding to the same number of degrees of a mercurial thermometer, the mercury being contained in a tube of some substance absolutely unaffected as to its volume by heat, could such be found. The proper corrections can be deduced from the following Table: Temperatures indicated by Temperatures indicated by ordinary air-thermometer. thermometer at same time. 0 0 10.0 1008 20.0 20-14 30-0 30-18 40-0 40-20 50.0 5020 60-0 60-18 70-0 70-14 80-0 80-10 90-0 90-05 100-0 100-00 This Table is copied from RECKNAGEL. REGNAULT found 50? air-thermometer to correspond to 500.20 by mercurial thermometer. Professor MILLER has sent me, the following investigation of the correction to be applied* British Association Report, 1863. BY HEAT OF METALS AND ALLOYS. 879 to reduce the temperatures indicated by -the common mercurial thermometer to those indicated by a thermometer of the second kind mentioned above. I have since found' that IRECKNAGEL and POGGENDORFFt have given a similar investigation. A'_____________ .3 Let M B denote a mercurial thermometer in which A is the freezing-, B the boilingpoint, the capacity of the tube between A and B beingdivided into 100-parts of equal capacity. Let M' B' denote a thermometer of material absolutely uninfinenced by heat, having exactly the dimensions of A B when at jO a; At, B' its reeingand boiling-points and: the capacity of A', B' divided-into .100 parts of equal volume. Let V be the capacity of M A at 00, 100 K the capacity of A B at ,0. Sincethe thermometers are exactly alike atO0, thecapacity of M' A' will be V. Let the capacity of A' B'= 1000 my, and, therefore, m the cubic expansion of mercury for 1? in terms of the indications of thermometer MA B'; g the cubic expansion of glass or 1?. When the thermometers are at the same temperature, let the ends of the columns of mercury stand at T T', t, t' being the number of degrees between A 'and T, and A' and T' respectively. The capacity of MA will now be V(i+it') and that of AT will -be Kt (1+gtt) and the volume of the mercury in M T will be V(1 +Mt'). Hence TV(1 +mt9=V(1+gt') +Kt(1 +g') Therefore Vo(n -g)t =Kt(1 gt'). But t and t' are both 100 at the same time. Hence M t7-)100=K1OO(l Og100). Therefore K g t'=t J t0O =t-gt(100-t') very nearly. But g is very small and t' very nearly equal to t. Hence t'=t-gt(100-t), very nearly. g varies from 0 000023 to 0 000028. Taking the higher value, at 500 C., t-t'= 0 000028 X50 X 50007 C., at 250 0., tt---=0000028 x 25 x 75 0?052OC. Hence the expansion of mercury is notproportional to its ascent 'in the tubeof a thermometer, and the difference of rates is a perfectly sensible quantity too large to neglect in many 'researches. Part of the increased rate of expansion of various bodies' at high temperatures is due to this error of the mercurial thermometer, whichindicates temperature between O? and 1000 too high'as measured by the true expansion of mercury. .* PoGGENDo1Fr's ' Annalen,' vol. exxiii. p. 115. t Ibid. vol. xli. p. 372.6 c 2 880 DR. A. M-ATTHIESSEN ON THE EXPANSION REGNAULT frequently used a thermometre a poids. Let P be the weight of mercury contained in it at 00 C., p the weight of mercury expelled when exposed to the temperature t by ordinary thermometer. At temperature t by ordinary thermometer the volume of mercury below 0 is V(1 +gt'), and the volume of the mercury above 0? is Kt(1 +gt'). Therefore the volume of the whole of the mercury is V(1+gt')+Kt(1+gt'). Hence p Kt( +?gt') Kt P-V(1 +gt') + Kt(1 +gt') V + Kt Therefore p Kt -=pv . When t=100 let p=b. Therefore b KlOO. P-b v' therefore t P-b P 1O0P-P b P -b p t REGNAULT uses p p E as the measureof temperature, which is the same as l onthe indication of a common mercurial thermometer uncorrected for the effect produced by the expansion of glass. A small error is generally made in taking the boiling-point of water, 100?, viz. the influence of latitude is not taken"into consideration. Professor MILLER writes to me on this point the following:-" LAPLACE, in the fifth edition' of his 'Systeme du Monde,' states that he regards 1000 C. to mean the temperature of water boiling under a pressure equivalent to that of a column of mercury at 0? and 760 millims. in latitude 450. "DULONG, and afterwards REGNAULT, assumed 1000 to be that of boiling water under normal pressure at Paris. Now the pressure at1 760 millims. of mercury at the level of the sea in latitude 450 is equivalent to a column in latitude X at z metres above the level of the sea, the height of which is 760 (-11322) (1-0-0025659 cos . 2X), where r= radius of the earth =6366198 metres. "The latitude of Paris (480 50' 14") is not very different from 450. REGNAULT'S place of observation was about 60 metres above the sea. Hence a column of 760 millims. mercury at the level of the sea exerts the same pressure as a column of 759-75 millims. in REGNAULT'S laboratory." This will only make a difference in the boiling-point of 0'01, a difference which may be neglected in ordinary work~, but in normal researches ought to be brought into calculation; as, for example, in MILLER'S normal research "'On 'the Construction of th-e New Standard Pound"*. At Abo this correction would amount to upwards of 0?'25. In the text-books on' chemistry and natural philosophy we find the coefficients of* Philosophical Transactions, 1856, p. 753. BY HEAT OF METALS AND ALLOYS. 881 expansion of air given 0 003665 for each degree of the mercury-thermometer, which is not correct; for as air expands regularly between O0 and 1000 according to the air-thermometer, a unit of volume of air measured at 00 will not occupy a' volume at 20-14 mercury-thermometer equal to 1+0-003665 x 20K14=1-07380 but 1+0 i003665 x 20=1-07330, showing a difference of 0 05 per cent. MILLER, in his paper already mentioned, p. 714, says, "REGNAULT found the expansion of air from 00 to 1000 under constant pressure equal to 0-36706 of its volume at 00.. ..The' difference between the mercurial and air-thermometers amounts to about 0 2. Hence the expansion of air between 00 and 500.2 is 0-18353 of its volume at 00; or between 00 and 50? the ratio of the density of air at 0' to its density at t is 1 +0 003656 X t." In the -present state of science it seems quite wrong that such a want of accordance should exist in our normal instruments, considering that otherwise the errors that exist between the instruments do not amount to 00.1 when properly made. I have, had several normal thermometers made for my experiments by Messrs. NEGRETTI 'and ZAMBRA, and in every case, when compared with my Kew Standard, the agreement between them has been almost perfect. It would be decidedly a step in the right direction if in future the fact that mercury does not expand regularly between 0? and 1000 were taken into account in the construction of all normal thermometers; and if some comparisons between the Kew .Standard and the air-thermometer were made, then the readings of thermometers which have been compared with the Kew Standard might be easily corrected. JOLLY*, in his research into the expansion of water, corrected his thermometers by comparing them with an air-thermometer; unfortunately, however, he does not give a table containing these comparisons;; so that his results are obviously not comparable with those obtained with the mercury-thermometer, and therefore at present I am unable to compare his results with those obtained on the same subject by myself. In conclusion, my thanks are due to Dr. M. BEHREND for carrying out the determinations for the Series 1, 2, 13, 20, 21, 24 to 27 and 34, to Mr. BASSETT, who aided me in carrying out the others, and to Mr. R. P. WRIGHT for having undertaken the greater part of the computations.* Berichte der K. b. Akad. der Wissench. zu Mfinchen, 1864, p. 141.
