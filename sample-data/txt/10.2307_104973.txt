An Account of the Earthquakes felt at Brussels; in a Letter from John Pringle, M. D. F. R. S. to Thomas Birch, D.D. F. R. S. BY a letter, which I received a few days ago, from Dr. Brady, physician to the court at Brussels, I find they have felt in that city this winter three several shocks of an earthquake. The first was on the 26th of December; the second on the day following; and the third on the 18th of February; being the same day it was said to be felt on our coast, between Margate and Dover; but the hour is not mentioned. All these shocks, he says, greatly alarmed the inhabitants; but were otherwise attended with no bad consequences. Read Mar. 11 1756. Dr. Brady adds, that he was told by a gentleman from Liege, that the men, who were at work in the coal-pits, and particularly in some of the deepest, near that city, had assured him, that they heard the rumbling noise preceding the shock as over their heads; whilst those, who were above ground, heard the same kind of noise as under their feet. I have inclosed a letter, which, if you think proper, may be laid before the Society, as containing an 9 [547] an authentic account of the sinking in of the small river near Pontypool in Wales. It is written by an excise-officer in that district, and was put into my hand by Mr. Windham Bowyer, one of the commissioners of that board. I am, S I R, Your most obedient Pall-mall, Mar. 11. 1756. humble servant, John Pringle. LXXX.
