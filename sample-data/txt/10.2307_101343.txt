A Way of making Vines grow to advantage, all over the roof of a house; communicated by Mr. John Templer. I Have lately seen a pretty and pleasant culture of Vines at the house of a Gentleman, who makes very good Whitewine of his own Grapes. He lets Vines ascend by one single stem to the Eaves of his house (cutting off all the luxuriant branches by the way,)then gives them liberty to spread upon the tiles, all over one side the roof of his house. Thus he furnishes his dwelling house, and many out-houses; by which means the vines are no hinderance to his other Wall-fruit, and the rays of the Sun being almost direct upon the Vines,he hath riper, sweeter and greater plenty of grapes, than when their vines are placed as Wall-fruit.
