(1072) ANTI~IATPIBH, Sive Animadversiones in Malachiae Thrustoni M. D. Diatribam de Respirationis Usu primario. Auctore Georgio Entio, Eq. aur. M.D. & Col. Lond. Soc. in Oct. 1679. IN this Book (besides the Anatomical Observations) several opinions are proposed and defended with the known Elegancy and Learning of the Author. I shall here set them down in the order I find them; and for the Arguments refer the Reader to the Book it self: least I should either do wrong to the Author, or transcribe the whole. It seems probable, saith our Author, that the finer part of the Alimentary Juice, is transmitted from the Stomach and Guts, by mediation of small concave Fibres thereto annexed, (and of which the Body chiefly consisteth) to the several Parts for their nourishment. page 8, 11. That the same Alimentary Juice, is that which in the use of Vomitories and Catharticks,is by the same Concave Fibres disgorged into the Stomack and Guts: and not by Lacteal Veins, or the Arteries. page 8. That the Water or Serum which is extravasated in Hydropick persons, issues not from the sanguiferous Vessels. But that it is the Nutritious Juice it self, which either by an ulcer in some Mesenterick Gland, which is not unusual, or an Aperture in some Lymphaeduct, oozes into the Cavity of the Abdomen. page 10. That the Febrisick matter in Intermittents, is not lodged originally in the the Blood. page 10. That the Pituita supposed by Dr. Glisson and others to be spued out of the Arteries(as having there no further use)into the Coats of the Stomack; is this very Nutritious Juice, tending to other Parts of the Body, but upon the death of the Animal, by cold and flower motion condensed, and there arrested in its way. page 10. That after the same manner Milk is also transferred to the Breasts. page 10. That neither in Abscesses, nor in any other Case, it is the extravsated Blood (1073) Blood that suppurates, but only the Nutritious or Alimentary Juice. page 12, 13, 32. That accordingly in the Small Pox, the purulent Matter is not derived or bred out of the Blood, but out of the aforesaid Juice. So that if a Woman with Child hath the Small Pox, the Child is found to have them too: though not one drop of the Mothers Blood passeth into the Child. page 13. That the Membranes and Nerves suck in their nourishment from the Glands of the Mouth and Throat, while we chew our Meat. page. 18. That after it is concocted in the Stomach, part of it is filtrated and transferred by the Oesophagus or Gullet to the Brain. page 18. From whence it is also derived to the Nerves and Membranes, especially the Membrana Carnosa originated of the Pia Mater. page 19. That the Colliquamentum, which first appears in a Setting Egg, is the groundwork or beginning of the Brain. page 22. That the Blood serves not to nourish the Body, but only to soment it, as it were, or keep it warm. page. 33, 154. That Generation is Opus Ideale, and the Semen not to be taken for an Extract from the several Parts. For Viviparous Animals have a Placenta, to which there is nothing analogous in either Parent, &c. page 40, 41. That the Puls is rather the Vibration, by a continuation of the motion from the Heart, then the Intumescence of the Artery. page 47. That urine is not derived to the Reins by the Emulgent Arteries (which bring the Blood only to cherish and keep them warm.) but by the Nerves. In favour whereof divers Arguments are proposed from page 62. to 67. That what are called the Lungs of a Frog, are only Wind-Bladders, analogous not to Lungs, which in a Frog are no where found, but to that Part, which in Fithes is commonly called the Swim. page 69. That the primary use of Respiration, is not to carry off fuliginous steams from the Blood, but for the ventilation of the Vital flame in the Heart or Blood, and supplying it with proper fuel. page 72. That 'tis a vulgar error, That the Action of Exspiration is performed more slowly, than of Inspiration. page 72. That in the tip of an Indian naked Dogs Ear, there are no Muscles found, although he command it into various and nimble motions page 73. That the only use of the Diaphragm, is to facilitate Respiration by guarding the Heart and Lungs, that the lower Viscera do not throng in upon them, page 74. That Respiration is not needful to the motion or circulation of the Blood. page 87. That although heretofore our Author thought the Air in Inspiration to (1074) to be mixed with the Blood; yet he saith, that after several Experiments made, he could not by any good Argument evince the same. page 93. He hath made the Experiment, That Whey tinged with Saffron, being injected into the Pulmonary Artery, imediately runs into the lest Ventricle of the Heart, without the assistance of Inspiration. Neither doth any Blood at the same time break ~ into the Lungs. p. 101. He saith ~, He supposeth, that Animal Motions, are not made by the influence of the Animal Spirits. But, that in each Part is seated a private sense, which is under the command of the Soul. And that therefore there are no Animal Spirits, but those in the Blood, called by the Name of the Calor Nativus. In favour whereof many Arguments are offered from p. 123, to 141. That the suspension or Intermission of Inspiration for a certain time, doth not alter the Puls. p. 145. That the Cause of Transparency is to be refer'd to the Texture of the transparent Body, and its Aptitude to continue the Motion by which Light is made, p. 179. Much after the same manner, as Sound is ontinued through a Window or a Wall, p. 180. And that therefore the Rays of Light do not pass through a diaphanous Body, p. 184. That Colours arise from the sparing or copious, strong or languid Reflections of Light from Bodies variously figured; as sounds from strings variously sized or stop'd, p. 185. So that the Nature of Light, is as if one should cause all the strings of a Viol to Vibrate together, so as to make one continued sound: that of Colours, as if their Vibrations were distinguished by divers and successive stops, p. 188.
