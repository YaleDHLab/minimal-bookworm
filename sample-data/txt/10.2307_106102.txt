LXI. O o 2 Hence [284] Hence it appears, that if the mean height of barometers, on a level with the surface of the sea, be supposed, with Dr. Scheuchzer, Phil. Trans. No 405, 406, 29,993 inches and the mean height at Caen, 29,752 ditto ~ 0,241 the diff. will be the greater mean weight of the atmosphere at the surface of the sea, then at Caen: and if, with the Doctor, we allow, for each tenth of an inch depression of the quicksilver, 90 feet elevation, my room, which is in the highest part of the town, will be about 217 feet above the level of the sea. Monsieur de Luc, of Geneva, has given a method to measure the different elevation of places by barometers, grounded on his own observations, far more exact than any other before him; his rule is, `` the difference of the logarithms of the height of `` the quicksilver, in the two places, reduced into French lines, `` and the logarithms carried to five places, including the charac`` teristicks, will give the difference of elevation in toises, if `` Fahrenheit's thermometer be nearly at 66~; but about 1/18 must `` be deducted from the elevation so given, if the thermometer `` be at 55~ or temperate.'' 29,993 English inch.=337,824 French lines log. 25286,8 29,752 ditto = 335,110 ditto log. 25251,9 ~ diff. 34,9 toises or 209 4 French feet = 223 English feet nearly; from which if 1/18 = 12 1/2 nearly be deducted, 210 1/2 feet remain for the difference of elevation of my room and the surface of the sea, which differs 6 1/2 feet from the result given by the first hypothesis. The greatest height observed, in these five years, with a good Fahrenheit's thermometer screened from the sun, in a S. W. room, was as follows at noon: 1765 August 23d 1766 August 9th 76~ 1765 June 7th the least height of ditto Jan. 6th 1768 14 1765 August 23, exposed the thermometer, at noon, to the sun, suspended on a thread between two sticks, in the middle of my garden at Caen, which may be about two English acres, so that the thermometer received the least reflected heat possible in that place; the quicksilver stood as follows, at [285] at 1h P. M. 97~ at 2 ditto 96 1765 August 26, at a village, called les Iles Bardelles, 7 leagues from Caen, the same thermometer, in a South room, from which the sun was excluded by the window shutters, rose to 90~.

Experi[287] Experiments on some Liquids. 1768 H. M. Jan. 3 11 30 I placed a wine glass half full of rack, another half full of rum, in a North window, to the open air: the next day, at the same hour, the rack was frozen to a thick jelly, with icey particles; the rum also to a jelly, but less thick. 4 50 I exposed, as above, a wine glass, half full of cyder: ditto of beer. Ditto of red wine, called Beaujenci. 5 13 The cyder began to freeze. 6 30 Ditto consolidated. 4 5 5 The beer began to freeze. 6 30. Ditto consolidated. 5 12 The wine began to freeze. 6 30 Ditto nearly consolidated. The icey surface of the cyder being broken, it froze over again, in three or four seconds, the ice forming, with a progressive motion, very perceptible to the eye. 9 00 I exposed, as above, a wine glass half full of Malaga wine. Half ditto of Burgundy, called Migraine. Half ditto of Roussillon wine. Half ditto of spring water. 5 Half ditto of cyder-brandy 9 15 The water began to freeze. 9 30 Ditto consolidated. 9 30 The Malaga,Migraine,Roussillon, began to freeze. ~ 00 Ditto ditto ditto consolidated. N. B. [288] N. B. The brandy did not freeze; but the 6th at noon, the quantity was diminished, and some icey particles stuck to the glass, above the surface of what remained. I found, by weighing the above liquids hydrostatically, in a temperate state of heat, that the migraine, cyder, beaujenci, beer, and the water, were very nearly of the same specific gravity; and that a piece of gold, which weighed in the water 224,25 grains, weighed in the Malaga 224,00 ditto, in the Roussillon 224,50 ditto, in the brandy 225,00 ditto.
