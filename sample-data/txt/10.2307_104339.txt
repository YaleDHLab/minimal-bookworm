Electrical Experiments made before the ROYAL SOCIETY, on Thursday, March 15th 1740-1. by the Same. HAving shewn lately by some plain Experiments, that the Electricity of Glass is different from that of Sealing-wax; because the Wax attracted a Feather suspended in the Air by a fine Silk, when the rubbed glass Tube repelled it, (as described in the Account of those Experiments) I made the Experiment with a Cake of Rosin instead of Sealing.wax; and it appeared to have the same kind of Electricity as the Sealing-wax. Then considering that the Supporters of any non-electric Conductors of Electricity must themselves be electric, I had a mind to try whether Bodies, endued with either kind of Electricity, were in any-wise different in that Case; which I did by the following Experiments: I laid a Piece of Wood, Four Foot long, on Two glass Plates, whose Ends stood One Foot beyond the Side of the Table on which they were laid: Then, ap[640] applying the rubbed Tube to one End of the Wood, the other attracted Leaf-brass, or a Thread hanging down from a Stick. Then, instead of the glass Plates, I laid the long Piece of Wood on Two Cakes of Rosin, and applied the rubbed Tube to the End of the said Wood, which conducted the Electricity to the other End, where Leaf brass and the Thread were attracted in the same Manner. This shews that, in order to conduct Electricity along any non-electric Body, it is indifferent what Kind of Electricity its Supporters are endowed with, provided they are electric.
