Abstract Qf a Register of the Baromeler Thermowzeter, and Rain? at Lylldon, in Rutland. By Thomas Barker, Esq. ; witb tbe Rain in Surrey and Hampshirefor the Cear 179I. Comnlunicated by Thonlas White? Esq; F. R S. Read June 14, ty92. Mr. BARKER'S Register, &c.363THE year began, as the last ended, with frost, but in a week's timethe stormy wet uteather returned, and, in some places, svith thutlder; but it gradually grew better, and by the middle Of February there was a good deal of filae and pleasant weather, and, except a few frosty days and north svinds the end of that month and beginnirlg of Marcll, the forluer part of spring was finer than usual; few NW winds, and tho,se not so cold as they often are: chiefly dry in March ; a good seed time, and a showery, warm, or almost hot, greater part of April, brougilt things on a great pace; arld there was more grass at the end of that month than there sometimes is at the end of May. But the two last days of April were colder; frequent frosty mornitags, and cold NE vvinds in Mays wllich being chiefly dry, the grass began to burn at the end of it; but there had been so much early grass that there was no want. The summer was a very uncertain one, sonletimes very hot, at other tilnes remarkably cold; and sharp frosty mornillgs the middle of June, svith a little hailX arld some sai(l snow; killed, or near it, many tender sutumer plants; and there were very fiew llatural ground cucumbers this year, but it was dry and burning at the end of the month. tlnhe weather svas also very different in different countries: in tlle east arld south-east parts of England they compIained of a five-months drought ; in this country, thougll the ground burned sornetimes, as at the end of Mays and the begillning alld end of June, yet the grass had got so forsrard itl-Apri] tIlat with some raill at times, our groud-was never bare; and fits of showery weather, and sorne great rains, made plenty of latter grass and turnips. At Selbournn April, May, and June, vvere rather dry, but there MF. 8ARKERS Register, &c.364was so much rain at the beginning and exld of the year, and al: the middle of it, in July, tllat there was a lrery great quantity up-on the whole.: The crop of hay was small, but well got; the wheat remarkably goodS and barley proved better than was expected; otller sorts of graln were moderaten and, irl general hararest wras well got. The latter part of sururner and the auturnn were very fine and pleasant, and sometinzes hot; generally dry, so as rather terlding to burn, the lbeginning of October; lbut before the middle it began to ke wetter, arld after the middle more stormy, ancl grew colder, with frosty mornings, cutting oflF the latfe flowers; and it continued wet the rest of October, and all Nvvembers and stormy in November and December; which last month svas a very disagreeable one, for storns, snow-, and frost, and sometimes all at once; and that almost the whole nlonth, for a snow and se+7ere frost, which beg;all the third though with several thawing days, was hardly quite gone by the end of the year: there was but little of this frost alld snow in the south of England. Of vtiiking Ewes. We fiXld itl the Greek and Roman writers, and also by some passages in the Bible, that it was the custom, in former timesy to milk ewbes as well as cows; and, perhaps, -it may better be flone in those hotter climates tlulan in England; yet I find it spoken of as harring been practised in this island many years ago TUSSER, whe li:ved in Suffolk, and was a young maU in EDWARD the VIth's time -(see his life at the elld of his work), mentions it as used ln his time, and he approved of doing M>.

BARKER S Regzster, &e.it frotn May-day till Lammas, but not longer} for fear of killv ing them. As he seembs to halre beerl bred a singirlg boy at Wallingford, the requiem ternam probably refers to some hymn he there sang. BuL, I suppose, this method of milking ewes was not found to answer UpOll t;he whole, for it -is left off itl England llosr. I never was in any part of it where it is practisecl at prsesent; tllougltl by tlae increase of inclosure, and sosving of seeds, we have better pasture for otlr ewes than TUSSER had. I thirlk it must be very bad for the latubs to be weaned at May-day,, wilich is often before the grass ;s fully come, thovugh his lambs were earlier than ours; for it appears in -his January«s Husbandry, that the ewes were about Iatnbing then, whereas ours do not come till Lady-day. We do not vean our cade-lanhs till June, in the height of summer, and then they are not so g;ood as those which go with ewes till the latter end of August. Not;e.
