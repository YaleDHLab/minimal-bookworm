[ 243 ] XI. On the Tides of the Arctic Seas. By the Rev. SAMUEL HAUGHTON, A.A., F.R.S., Fellow of Trinity College, Dublin. Part I. On the Diurnal Tides of Port Leopold, North Somerset. Received November 7, 1861,-Read January 9, 1862. I AM indebted to the courtesy of Captain WASHINGTON, R.N., Hydrographer to the Navy, for the opportunity I have had of investigating the tides of Port Leopold. Having heard that I was engaged in the discussion of the Arctic Tides, he kindly placed at my disposal the observations made on board Her Majesty's Ship 'Investigator,' during the expedition of 1848-49, under the orders of Sir JAMES C. Ross, R.N., in search of Sir JOHN FRANKLIN. The ' Investigator' was anchored, or rather fast in the ice, during the, winter of 1848 in Port Leopold, North Somerset, lat. 740 N., long. 900 W., in three fathoms water; and the observations on the tides were made by Lieut. FREDERICK ROBINSON' whose care and skill in observing are highly to be commended. By carefully laying down the daily high and low waters, I have succeeded in completely separating the Diurnal from the Semidiurnal Tide, and in resolving each tide into the portions due respectively to the action of the Sun and of the Moon. In the following discussion of the Diurnal Tide, I shall first give the results of the actual observations, when graphically laid down, and afterwards draw the inferences which appear to follow from them, when compared with theory. The mode of reduction used by me will be evident from an inspection of the MS. diagrams which accompany this paper. The following Table contains the Range of Diurnal Tride at High and at Low Water, and the Times of Vanishing of the Diurnal Tide at High and at Low Water.

I. and II., a graphical representation of the first two columns of the preceding Table, by means of which the relation of the range of Diurnal Tide, at High and Low Water, to the Solstices and Equinoxes is made apparent. There is no difficulty in understanding, as will be presently shown, why the Diurnal Tide should reach a maximum at the Solstices, and a minimum at the Equinoxes, as is shown by the curves for High and Low Water, because the Solar Diurnal Tide vanishes at the Equinoxes, and consequently the equinoctial Diurnal Tide is due solely to the Moon, while the Solstitial Diurnal Tide is due to the united action of both Sun and Moon. The following Tables II. and III. show the interval between the vanishing of the Diurnal Tide and the time of the vanishing of the Moon's Declination.* Transactions of the Royal Irish Academy, vol. xxiii. pp. 133, 134, 137.

HAUGHTON ON THE TIDES OF THE In this Table, the positive Sign denotes that the Vanishing of the Diurnal Tide follows the Vanishing of the Moon's Declination, and the negative sign denotes that it precedes it. From the mean result of the two Tables, it would seem that the Vanishing of the Diurnal Tide at Low Water precedes the Vanishing of the Diurnal Tide at High Water, by a mean amount of 3d 71i 30m. The intervals at which the vanishing of the Diurnal Tide at High Water follows the Vanishing at Low Water are shown in detail in the following Table and in fig. III., Plate XI.

The regularity with which this increase of interval takes place is still better shown by the figure, which represents the Table, the abscissa denoting time, and the ordinates the interval from the vanishing of the Diurnal Tide at Low Water to its vanishing at High Water. The minimum interval, 12 hours, occurs at the time of the Equinoxes, and the maximum interval, 4 days to 4{ days, occurs at the time of the Solstices. I am not aware that this feature of the Diurnal Tide has been before noticed; it is perfectly in accordance with what might be expected from Tidal Theory. According to the best theories of the Tides, the Diurnal Tide may be represented by the expression D--Ssin2o cos(S.-t. )+M sin 2pcos (m.-.im).*******(1.) ARCTIC SEAS&.-PARTS I. AND II.-PORT LEOPOLD. 247 In this equation D is theheight of the Diurnal Tide, in feet. S and M are the coefficients, in feet, of the Solar and Lunar Diurnal Tides. o; and pare the Declinations of the Sun and Moon, at a period preceding the moment of observation, by an unknown interval to be determined for each luminary, and called the Age of the Solar and Lunar Diurnal Tide. $ and m are the hour-angles. of the Sun and Moon, west of the meridian, at the time ofobservation., i, and tm are the Diurnal Solitidal and Lunitidal intervals, or the times which elapse between the Sun and Moon's southing, and the time of Solar and Lunar Diurnal High Water. At any time near the Equinox, the declination a of the Sun is either zero or very small, and therefore D will vanish when 0, the Moon's declination, vanishes, and this will happen at both High and Low Water, or at any other time of the day; therefore at the equinoxes the vanishing of the diurnal tide at the time of High or of Low Water ought to be sensibly the same; but at the time of the Solstices, both members of the right-hand side of equation (1.) will have sensible values, and the Diurnal Tide will vanish when these members are equal and of opposite signs; therefore, to-find the time of vanishing of the Diurnal Tide, we have M. sin 2 cos (m(-2. ads (s a) S ~~sin 2 .... ..(. At the time of High Water, m, the moon's hour-angle is sensibly constant, or at least varies within narrow limits; also, since the vanishing of the Diurnal Tide at High Water occurs at intervals of about a semilunation, the moon's declination, [h, at each. vanishing of the Diurnal Tide will also vary within small limits; hence in passing from the equinox to the solstice,> the right-hand side of (2.) will have its change of value depending chiefly on the change of a'; and it will therefore diminish as a increases; therefore cos (s-i8) will diminish, and (s-is) increase; but s is the hour-angle of the Sun at the time of High Water, and increases day by day (48m mean); therefore as we approach the Solstice, the day on which we are to expect the Diurnal Tide to vanish at the time of High Water will occur later and later. But at the time of Low Water the angles s and M must be increased by 90? or 6 hours; and therefore (2.) becomes M sin 2S sin(m -"-m)( sin 2T By, reasoning similar to that. used with respect to equation (2.), we can show that sin (sXi) diminishes in passing from the Equinox to the Solstice, and therefore that (s-i8) also diminishes; therefore the time of vanishing of the Diurnal Tide at the time of Low Water occurs earlier and earlier as we approach the Solstice. We thus see that the times -of vanishing at High and Low Water move in opposite directions, and 248 REV. S. IIAITGHTON ON THE TIDES OF THE become most widely separated at the time of the Solstice. This result agrees perfectly with the facts of observation at Port Leopold recorded in Table IV. and the accompanying fig. III. Plate XI. I shall now endeavour to separate, in the Diurnal Tide, the effects of the Sun and Moon. In equation (1.), the effect of the Sun, represented by the first member of the right-hand side of the equation, when observed at High Water, may be considered to owe its periodical change almost altogether to the change in cos (s-i8), the angle s increasing day by day as the tide becomes later and later; for the angle 6 may be regarded as sensibly constant during the semilunation. On the other hand, the Lunar portion of the Diurnal Tide owes its change to the change of p, the moon's declination, for the angle (m-?im) is sensibly constant. The Solar Diurnal Tide disappears at the equinox, because then o'= 0; hence we may find the Lunar Diurnal Tide, at that period of the year, uncomplicated by the coexistence of the Solar Tide. Taking the means of the Diurnal Tide Ranges at High and Low Water for March and April*, I find At High Water D=1h462 ft.=M sin (2p). cos (m-im); at Low Water D=0-852 ft. =M sin (2p). cos (m-im+ 900), m denoting the moon's hour-angle at High Water, and p denoting the moon's maximum declination. Dividing one of these equations by the other, we find 1P462 cot (-im)=0852;.(4.) from which we deduce m-im=149' 46'=1011 19. rn, the moon's hour-angle at High Water, is shown by the observations made in March and April to have at New and Full Moon a mean value of 12h Om. Substituting this value in the preceding equation, I obtain, (1) The Lunitidal Diurnal Interval tro=1l 41m. The coefficient M of the Lunar Diurnal Tide may be found as follows:Let H= Range of Diurnal Tide, at High Water, at the equinox. Let L=Range of Diurnal Tide, at Low Water, at the equinox. Then 2M sin 2(max. declination of moon)=V/H2+L2. . . , (6.) Substituting in this equation the values of H, L, and p, we find 2M sin 37= V(1-462)2+(0.852)2-=1-692 feet; * The Tide Ranges used in obtaining these meanls and mlarked (*) in Table I. ARCTIC SEAS.-PARTS I. AND II.-PORT LEOPOLD. 249 and therefore, finally, (2) Coefficient of Lunar Diurnal Tide-=M=1:409 feet. The Age of the Lunar Diurnal Tide is found by examining the interval, at the Equinox, from the vanishing of the Moon's declination to the vanishing of the Diurnal Tide, at High and at Low Water. The interval from the Moon's declination vanishing to the Tide vanishing is given in Tables IL. and III. for High and Low Water; and the figs. IV. and V. of Plate XI. represent the results of those Tables. From these figures, or from the Tables which they represent, it is evident that the difference in the time of vanishing of the Diurnal Tide at the times of High and Low Water is not altogether due to the Solar Tide; for at the Equinox, when the Solar Tide has disappeared, the Age of the Lunar Diurnal Tide at High Water is id 21h, while the Age of the same Tide at Low Water is only Od 21h; showing a permanent difference of one whole day in the times of disappearance of the Tide at High and Low Water quite independent of the Solar Tide, which, as I have already shown, tends to increase this difference as we approach the Solstices. The Means of the Ages of the Diurnal Tide, taken from the Tides of the 13th and 25th of March and the 6th of April, 1849, at High Water, and from the Tides of the 11th and 24th of March and the 5th of April, 1849, at Low Water, are Id 21h and Od 2111*. I am unable to explain why the Age of the Lunar Diurnal Tide at High Water should be greater than its Age at Low Water; but there is good reason to believe that it is an established fact, as I found the same kind of difference of Age in the Tidal Observations made in 1850-51, on the coasts of Ireland, by the Royal Irish Academy. The following Table shows the difference in the Irish stations.

Coefficient of Lunar Diurnal Tide . . . . 1409 ft. .It remains now to determine, if possible, the corresponding Constants of the Solar Diurnal Tide. In order to effect this object, I laid down the Lunar Tide, both at High and Low Water, from the preceding constants, on the observed Diurnal Tide at the time of the Solstices, and thus obtained the constants of the Solar Tide, which at those periods of the year is. a maximum. Having thus, constructed the Lunar Tide, I found, by the difference between it and the Observed Diurnal Tide, that the maximum Solar Diurnal Tide was as follows:Range of Solidiurnal Tide at High Water:Summer Solstice, 1849. 082 Winter Solstice, 1848. 091 Range of Solidiurnal Tide at Low Water: Summer Solstice, 1849. 086 Winter Solstice, 1848. 088 Mean . . . o867 ft.

It will be observed in the preceding Table, that the time of the Diurnal Solar Tide, vanishing may be referred to one or other of two hours, which differ by 12h, and that the times of passing from + to at the two solstices are reversed. These changes are evident from the consideration of the expression. for the Solar Diurnal Tide, S sin 2o . cos(s-i8), which changes sign, from Solstice to Solstice, by the change of sign of (a), the sun's declination, and also changes sign at the two high waters or low waters of the same day by the increment of 1800 which the sun's hour-angle s undergoes. Combining all the results together, I find that the Solar Diurnal Tide vanishes at High Water when 8h 26m'-ij=18h and 20h or is 9h 34rn, and +1411. Mean value of IS=i41 I 3m; and that the Solar Diurnal Tide vanishes at Low Water when ~~~~~~~~7h57' is=18l1, and I19h 48mis= 6,1 or in, and +I3h 48m. Mean value of ij = i3h 52m 30S. The Mean of the values of the Solitidal Interval, at High and Low Water, is Zs=14h 2m 45s. From the preceding data we can readily find the coefficient of the Solar Diurnal Tide; for S X sin (max. declination of Sun)=0O867 feet, or S O86 1-186 feet. ~sin (470) The Age of the Solar Diurnal Tide cannot be deduced from observations such as those under discussion, because the Sun's declination changes so slowly at the Solstices, that it may be considered constant during a fortnight, and therefore the Coefficient S sin(2o) is also constant during that period. The Constants of the Solar Diurnal Tide, as just found, are as follow: .1. Diurnal Solitidal Interval . . 14h 2m 45s 2. Age of Solar Diurnal Tide . . . Unknown. 3.

The theory which I select for this purpose is that given by Mr. AIRy in his ' Tides and Waves,' which is considerably in advance of that given by LAPLACE and the earlier mathematicians, and, as it is directly founded on the motion of water in canals, seems particularly well adapted to the discussion of a tide like that of Port Leopold, which is situated at the extreme northern end of the Atlantic Ocean, which may be regarded as a Canal occupying a meridian circle, and nearly 10,000 miles in length. From the discussion of the Diurnal Tide, in a meridian canal, given by Mr. AIRY (Tides and Waves, p. 356), it may be deduced that the following equation is true, and that it contains the means of finding the mean depth of the Atlantic Canal: n2b k S mass of Sun d3 g b M hnass of MoonXW3XN2b k .(6) --4g b In this equation, S M are the coefficients of the Solar and Lunar Diurnal Tide, found, as at Port Leopold, by observation. D, d are the mean. distances of the Sun and Moon from the Earth. N, n are the angular velocities of the Sun and Moon about the Earth. b is the mean radius of the Earth. k is the mean depth of the Atlantic Canal. g is the velocity acquired in a second by a falling body. The left-hand side of equation (6.) is known by observation, and all the quantities on the right-hand side are known, except k. ARCTIC SEAS.-PARTS I. AND II.-PORT LEOPOLD. 253 Substituting, therefore, for the symbols the following values, M=0-842, mass of Sun mass ofMoon= 359551 X 85, d 59964 D2 x 12032 mass of Sun d3 mass of Moon XD 047288; 7912 b92 miles; 2 N9 =000345; lb =0.00323; g we find k 0 00323-4 0-842=0 473 34 t ~~0,00345 -4 from which I deduce k 1 b1072, k=3-69 miles. In discussing the Solar and Lunar Diurnal Tides of nine stations on the Irish Coasts, I found the following results*: M (mean of nine Stations)-0 5305; k 1 1.. I773 k 1= 2 miles. The mean depth of the Atlantic Canal may be also deduced, by means of Mr. AmRY's Theory of Tides with Friction, from a comparison of the Solitidal and Lunitidal Intervals, and from the Lunitidal Interval compared with the Age of the Lunar Tide. According to the Theory of Tidal Waves without Friction, Low Water should occur at the time of the meridian passage of the luminary; in consequence, however, of friction, the phase of High Water is accelerated by an interval equal to the difference between the Tidal Interval and half the period of a Tidal Oscillation. According to Mr. AIRy's Theory, taking account of friction (supposed proportional to the horizontal velocity of the tidal current), the acceleration of High Water is represented byt f t2-gkrn2* Trans.

The Age at High Water is .1 21", and at Low Water Od 21". Substituting these values respectively, I find miles. Depth of sea (k) deduced from Age of Lunar Diurnal Tide at High Water=7-96 Depth of sea deduced from Age of Lunar Diurnal Tide at Low Water =4119 Mean . . . . 7 Bringing together all the preceding results, we find the following mean depths of the Atlantic Canal, as deduced by the various methods described: miles. 1. Depth deduced from Heights of Solar and Lunar Diurnal Tides .3-69 2. Depth deduced from Accelerations of Solar and Lunar Diurnal Tides, caused by friction.13 07 3. Depth deduced from Acceleration and Age of Lunar Diurnal Tide, caused by friction. 607 Of the three methods just given for finding the mean depth of the sea, the first is the most trustworthy, for the following reasons: 1st. The determination of Heights of the Solar and Lunar Diurnal Tide by observation is more accurate than the determination of Acceleration and Age. 2nd. The theory by which the depth of the sea is deduced from Heights is independent of friction, the introduction of which requires additional hypotheses, which are, at best, of a doubtful character. At the same time it should be remarked that the depth of the sea deduced from Acceleration and Age, at eight stations on the coasts of Ireland, exceeded the depth deduced from Heights, in a manner similar to that which is found to occur at Port Leopold. The Irish depths are1. Depth of sea deduced from Heights of Solar and Lunar Diurnal miles. Tides. 512 2. Depth deduced from Accelerations of Solar and Lunar Diurnal Tides, caused by friction .1198 3.

S. HATUGITON ON TilE TIDES OF THE PART II.-The Semidiurnal Tides of Port Leopold, North Somerset. Received October 8,-Read November 27, 1862. When the daily height of High and Low Water has been cleared of the Diurnal Tide, as explained in Part I., and as is shown in the MS. diagrams that accompany this paper, it is easy to estimate the successive Heights of Spring and Neap Tides, cleared of the Diurnal Tide. Bringing together the Spring Tides and the Neap Tides, the following Tables I. and II. are constructed; and from the second column of these Tables the diagram No. 1 Plate XI. is prepared, of which the following explanation may be useful. The interval in the abscissa corresponds to five Lunar weeks, or intervals between the greatest Spring Tide and least Neap Tide. The ordinates are divided, as usual, into feet. The Curve a, drawn through alternate Spring Tide Heights, is the curve of New Moon Springs. The Curve a' is the Curve of Full Moon Springs. The Curve b is the Curve of First Quarter Neap Tides. The Curve 6' is the Curve of Third Quarter Neaps. These Curves are constructed from Tables I. and II., which are themselves formed from the Curves of the MS. diagram. The diagram No. 2, Plate XII. is formed from the first column of Table I. Its abscissa are the same as those of diagram No. 1, and its ordinates are the Solar Hours at which the Maximum Spring Tide occurred. Curve a represents the Time of New Moon Springs. Curve a' the Time of Full Moon Springs. TABLE I.---Semidiurnal Maximum Spring Tide Ranges, 1848-49. Time. Range. Moon's Hour-Angle, d h m ft. h m 1848.

The general expression for the Semidiurnal Tides is, as is well known, T=.S~ ) cos2 G cos 2 (s-i8)+M ( C-)3COs2 p cos 2 (in-im).(1.) where S and M are the Solar and Lunar Coefficients; P and p the Solar and Lunar parallax; and Pm _pm the mean values of the same. , the declinations of the Sun and Moon, at periods preceding that of observation by unknown intervals called the Solar and Lunar Age of the Semidiurnal Tide. s, m the hour-angles of the Sun and Moon, west of the meridian at the time of observation. is), m the Solar and Lunar Tidal intervals, or time after southing of the luminary, at which its high water is found to occur. From an inspection of diagrams 1 and 2, Plate XII., it is plain that the conditions of the tide are different at New and Full Moon, and in the Ist and 3rd Quarter. But the Solar conditions may be supposed constant for a fortnight, and as the moon's declination only enters equation (1.) by the square of the cosine, it must be q. p. the same at the beginning and end of a Lunar fortnight. The difference, therefore, shown in the diagrams must depend on the Moon's Parallax, which takes four weeks to complete its changes. From diagram No. 1, it appears that the greatest difference in the Parallactic Tide, between the opposite quarters of the Moon, both at Spring and Neap Tides, amounts to I 47 ft. in the range of the Tide. MDCCCLXIII. 2 N 258 REV. S. HAUGUTON ON THE TIDE$ Od THE I shall presently prove that the Lunar Tide Range at the time of this maximum Parallactic inequality is 4-6-2 ft.; adding, -to this, half the Parallactic inequality, and subtracting it from it, we find 5.35 t.1+e\3 '2 +:8 -eJ:3 (2.) that is, the cube of the ratio of the Apogee to the Perigee. Solving this equation for e, the eccentricity of the moon's orbit, we obtain 2e= 112 0=05303.) This value of the eccentricity of the moon's orbit is very near the true value 0-05484*, as near, indeed, as could be expected from any Tidal Observations. B.-Solar Semnidiurnal Tide. In diagram No. 1 the Curves marked A and B are drawn so as to eliminate the Parallactic inequality, and they represent the Curves of Spring and Neap Tide Ranges; but from the expression (1) it appears that if we could find two sets of tides, for which the moon's declination and hour-angle should be the same, we could eliminate the Lunar Tide and calculate the Solar Tide separately. These conditions are fulfilled by the Solstitial Springs and Equinoctial Neaps-as may be thus shown. Solstitial Springs:New Moon .June 20d 211 19m (Greenwich). Declination .18 49'N. q.p. maximum. Equinoctial Neaps: First Quarter .March 30d 181 58m (Greenwich). Declination .18 27' N. q. p. maximum. And the Curve of Spring Tide Range, cleared of Parallax, attains its Solstitial Minimum, Junle 21d 12h 40mH.W., and its Equinoctial Maximum, April Id 12h 201n L.W. We may therefore safely assume the part of equation (1.) which depends on the Moon to be the same at both these times. We therefore have a' 2S. cos' a cos 2(s' -i6)+2M cos2A' cos 2(m'-&m),1 a,,= 2S . cos2 ac, cos 2(s,,-i8) +2M cos2 , cos2(m-im),J.( where a', d-, s', i;, m' refer to Solstitial Springs, a' being the Solstitial Spring Range; and a,,, a,,, s,,, ps,, in,, refer to Equinloctial Neaps, a., being the Equinoctial Neap Range.

The constants of the Solar Tide being found, (9.) and (13.), nothing was easier than to calculate its amount at each Spring and Neap, and to subtract it from the former and add it to the latter. In this way the curves (a') and (j), diagram No. 1, were constructed, and represent the Lunar Semidiurnal Tide Range at Springs and Neaps respectively. 2 N2 260 IREV. S. HAUGHTON ON THE TIDES OF THE Its maximum and minimum amounts are Maximum Lunar Range=4-62 ft. Minimum Lunar Range=4-23 ft. If a and a' denote the maximum and minimum Lunar Ranges which correspond with the Spring and Neap Tides of either the Solstice or Equinox, and if mn and rn' denote the hour-angles of the moon at these tides, we have, if I=18to 190 be the inclination of moon's orbit, a = 2M cos2 I. cos 2(m -i.z), . c'i-2M cos2 (0) cos 2(n'-iJ,).J From which we deduce a cos2 I cos 2 (m -i at cos 2((,im) and a 2 cos 2m/-at cos0 I cos 2m tan 2?,'= -a sin 2ms'+ a' cos" I sinm * 2r'*n* 1* But, from Tables I. and II., m=2h 2m= 290 31', rn'..-71h 48m-=113? 14'.

(16.) cos (840 22)-'0 I have not been able to deduce from the observations any close approximation to the Age of the Lunar Tide, but think it is probably rather over than under five days. It would require more observations than the heights of high and low water to.determine this important constant with accuracy. D.-Mass of the Moon and -Depth of the Sea deducible from the Sernidiurnal Tide. According to the Statical Theory of the' Tides, excluding the terms depending on Parallax, Declination, Hour of Tide, &c., the ratio of the Solar to the Lunar coefficient is as follows S mass of Sun (d\3 17 M mass of MoonX D *.) ARCTIC SEAS.-PARTS I. AND II.-PORT LEOPOLD. 261 where D and d denote the mean distances of the Sun and Moon from the Earth. Hence we find mass of Sun 8 D mass of Moon-M I; /2x12032 3 x (2 59*964 But since S=P1705, and M-=4309, we have M=0.3956, (18.) and, finally, mass of Sun 359551 X 71-11. (I 9.) mass of Moon-SSl<74.1. From which we deduce the mass of the Moon to be 7 1j-th of that of the Earth. From the Dynamical Theory of the Tides given by Mr. AIRY (Tides and Waves, p. 357), the ratio of S to NI, for the Semidiurnal Tide, is the following: n2b k S mass of Sun (d 3 b M mass of Moon X(D) XFN2b k' . . . . (20.) -gb where N and n are the angular velocities of the Sun and Moon, k, b the mean depth of sea and radius of earth, and g the force of gravity. Substituting for these quantities their usual values, we find k 0,00323-_ -=0-47288 X 0,00345-k b or =0.47288x12778-k (21.) 13,648-k'.2. S Substituting for S its value 0-3956, we obtain by solving for k, k = depth of sea = 8-32 miles. . . a a (22.) Whatever doubt may attach to this high value of the mean depth of the Atlantic Canal, and to the depths 13-07 miles and 6-07 miles obtained from the Diurnal Tide in Part I., should properly be considered as belonging to the imperfect condition of the Theory of Canals of equal depth, as applied to such a body of water as the Atlantic Ocean, and not to the observations. It is, however, well worthy of remark, that we can obtain from the Solitidal and Lunitidal Intervals a value for the mean depth of the sea that is much more probable, and is also very close to the depth derived from the ratio of S to M in the Diurnal Tide. If we call the Acceleration of the Tide the difference between the Tidal Interval and 262 REV. S. .HAU-JGHTON ON THE TIDES OF THE the period of half a Tide Oscillation, we find, from Mr. AIRY'S Theory, the following equation for the Semidiurnal Tide:Lunitidal Acceleration N2-g, krn X Solitidal.

From this it may be inferred that the theory of Tides, with friction, in these two cases, comes nearer to the truth than it does in the other cases from which the higher values are derived. I do not know why this is so, and would recommend the fact to the notice of those mathematicians who are conversant with the Theory of the Tides.

This diagram was formed by laying down on ruled paper the observations of height recorded in the Tables of Observation. The alternate high waters were then joined by lines, forming two curves, the distance between which is double the Diurnal Tide at the time of High Water. The same construction was made for the Low Waters. As the Diurnal Tide vanishes with the declination, the equinoctial Diurnal Tide is altogether Lunar; accordingly the Lunar Diurnal Tide was found from the equinoctial portion of the diagram. When found, it was superposed on the Solstitial portion of the diagrams,-the points of intersection being found by means of the interval from d-0 to D 0, or age of tide already obtained from the equinoctial observations. The part of the diurnal curves remaining, after the superposition of the Lunar Tide, was the Solar Diurnal Tide. The Lunar and Solar Tides at High and Low Water having been thus found, their remaining constants, viz. Coefficients and Tidal Intervals, were worked out, as shown in the paper itself. A Curve, drawn bisecting the range of the Diurnal Tide at High Water, and another curve in like manner at Low Water, give the High and Low Water Curves of the Semidiurnal Tides that I have used in the second part of my paper on the Arctic Tides. This part of the subject is given in detail 'in the paper itself. IUU-l T77qs.
