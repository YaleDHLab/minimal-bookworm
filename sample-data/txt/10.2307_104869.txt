XXIV. A Letter from Mr. Joseph Ames F.R.S. and Secr. of the Soc. Antiquar. to C. Mortimer M. D. Secr. R. S. concerning a Plica Polonica. Good Sir, JUNE the 22nd, 1746, in the Morning, Mrs. Hannah Coomes, a neat old Woman, whose Hair (or Plica Polonica, as it is call'd) I shew'd the Society last Thursday, came and gave me the following Informations. Read May 28. 1747. That she was of a genteel Family in Staffordshire, who had suffer'd much in the Civil Wars; and that her Mother had her Hair grow in the same manner, whose Maiden Name was Alice Goldsmith; but her own Maiden Name was Hannah Bunby, born in the Hay-market, in the Parish of White-Chapel and baptized at Aldgate on a Saturday the of June, 1645. Her Mother, having such sort of Hair, used to comb hers much to prevent it, till sometimes the Blood came: When she was about 14 Years old she perceived it to grow thick just about the back Part of her Head, and at length grew to this matted long Substance I now saw it, of 109 Inches long. She says [557] says she has had four Husbands; the first Nicholas Woodcock, to whom she was married when about 28 Years old, and had four Children by him; all died young; but observed nothing of their Hair growing so. I am, S I R, Your most humble Servant, J. Ames. See some Cases of the Plica Polonica in these Transactions, No. 417. p. 50. et seq. C. M. XXV.
