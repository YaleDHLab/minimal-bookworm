(309) Some Communications from Rome and Paris. SIgnor Boretti, who is now at Rome, pretends to have lighted upon a way of building Gallies with several Tires of Oars, of different heights, which he esteems to be more convenient, more speedy and stronger than those that are now in use. He thinks also, that he can give an account of the possibility of the Gallies of the Ancients to a determinat number of tires; and he promises a Treaty of it, with demonstrations. There is also at Rome a Bowle, which is so counterpoised, that it can stop of it self upon an inclined plane like Keplers watch. It stops upon all sorts of matter, and even upon a Looking-glass. Pater Gottignies hath undertaken at Rome to write an Algebra after a new manner. He gives it the Title of Logistica universae Mathesi inserviens. It is to consist of four Books, whereof the first is already printed. Monsieur Blondel is busie in giving us a new Mapp of Paris, which will be correct, and of the bigness of fix footsquare. The like is also doing at Rome of that City by Signor Buffalini: But both will require a considerable time to finish them. There hath been sent to Paris the Title of a Book treating of the Universal Measure; the Author is an Italian, called Signor Burattini, and the Title as followeth: Misura Universale overo Trattato nel quale si mostra, come in tutti i luoghi del mondo si puo trovare una misura & un peso Universale, senzache habbiano relatione con niun' altra misura & niun' altro peso, & ad ogni modo in tutti i luoghi saranno lt mede simi & saranno inalterabili & perpetui, sin tanto che durera il mondo. La misura si puo trovar in un bora di tempo; & questa ci mostra, quento grave deve esser ilpeso. Della questa misura si cavano ancora le misure Corporee per misurar le cose aride & liquide. See what Monsieur Christian Hugens hath said upon this argument in his Book De Motu Pendulorum, prop. 25. p. 151.
