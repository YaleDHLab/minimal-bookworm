JAnuary 11.1675. about five a clock 12 min. in the Evening, in the Royal Observatory, M. Cassini, M. Picard, and M. Roemer, began to perceive, that the Oriental part of the Moon, by little and little lost its light; so that at 5 h. 25~. they saw a manifest penumbra; then at 5 h. 3 ~. 50~. the limb over against the Spot called Hevelius grew so dark, that they all agreed, that this was the true beginning of the Eclipse. They saw yet the little Spot Riccioli, which disappeared not till 15~. after; and so the Shadow advanced from spot to spot unto the other opposite limb of the Moon, according to the order below particulariz'd. Before (258) Before the Moon was almost altogether immersed into the Shadow of the Earth, there appear'd not any sensible Light in the part Eclipsed, as well by reason of the brightness of the other part yet remaining to be darkened, as of some little Mist then being about the Moon. But that Mist being dispelled, the Moon totally Eclipsed looked of a colour red-brown. The Eastern part, which was obscured first, appear'd at first more duskish than the other, and its blackness increased according as the Moon entred more and more into the Shadow of the Earth; but a while after, the same blackness ~ to the other side of the Moon, so that the Western part became in its turn to be of a redish colour, browner and darker than the other. At 8 h. 7~. the Limb that is about the Spot Grimaldi, and which was then next the Horizon, began to clear up: Which made one of the Observers believe, that it was the beginning of the Emersion. But, the whiteness of this Limb not being then yet great enough, the two other Observers judged this return of Clearness a little later, the one at 8 h. 8~. and the other at 8 h. 9~. 30~. Yet having in the sequel, a regard to the time of the discovery of the first Spots that came after, they all esteemed the first Emersion to have been at 8 h. 8~. And this shews what is to be expected from the Eclipses of the Moon for the determination of the Longitudes, when the Observers do content themselves barely to remark the beginning and the end of the Eclipse. During the greatest Obscuration, viz. at 7 h. 21~. the Southern Limb of the Moon was come close to a small Star, of the number of those that cannot be seen without a Telescope; which was compar'd with the Moon, by taking its distances from the Moon and the Shadow before the total Immersion, and afterward until the first Immersion; with a design, by means thereof to find the Parallax of the Moon. A little after the beginning of the Emersion, viz at 8 h. 9~. 20~, another Star,yet less than the former, came out at the darkest side, almost over against the Spot Langrenus; which place was taken but to be near so, because then they could discern nothing in that part, though they saw well enough the whole contour or compass of the Moon. Lastly, at 9 h. 9~. 40~. all the three Observers agreed, that the Moon then came out of the Shadow; but there remained a Penumbra, which lasted for sometime after. The (259) The Diametter of the Moon, being measured before the Eclipse, was of 32~. 15~. 'Tis true, that when she was wholly Eclipsed, she was found less by some Seconds than before the Eclipse: But since 'tis difficult to measure her in that State, there is reason to doubt of this Observation. The Times were noted by great Pendulum-Watches, that had been adjusted by the Sun the same day, and that were afterwards verified the next day: Besides, that before the Eclipse at 4 h. 45~. 1~. by the Watches, the Star Capella was 45 degrees high towards the East.
