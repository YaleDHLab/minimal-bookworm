[ 127 ] VII. Researches on the Partition of Numbers. B~y ARTHUR CAYLEY, Esq. Received April 14,-Read May 3 and 10, 1855. I PROPOSE to discuss the following problem: "To find in how many ways a number q can be made up of the elements a, b, c,.. each element being repeatable an indefinite number of times." The required number of partitions is represented by the notation P(a, b, c, ..)q, and we have, as is well known, P(a, b, c, . .)q _ coeffcient xq in _1-an) (I -fib) (1_c-, where the expansion is to be effected in ascending powers of x. It may be as well to remark that each element is to be considered as a separate and distinct element, notwithstanding any equalities which may exist between the numbers a, b, c,..; thus, although a=b, yet a+a+a+ &c. and a+a+b+ &c. are to be considered as two different partitions of the number q, and so in all similar cases. The solution of the problem is thus seen to depend upon the theory, to which I now proceed, of the expansion of algebraical fractions. Consider an algebraical fraction where the denominator is the product of any number of factors (the same or different) of the form 1 -m. Suppose in general that [1 -m] denotes the irreducible factor of 1 Xm, i. e. the factor which, equated to zero, gives the prime roots of the equation ILxm O. We have 1 -xm=H[l .XmI], where m' denotes any divisor whatever of m (unity and the number m itself not excluded). Hence, if a represent a divisor of one or more of the indices m, and k be the number of the indices of which a is a divisor, we have fx=n[l1 _Xa]kA Now considering apart from the others one of the multiple factors [1-xajk, we may writefx= [1 IXa]YX. Suppose that the fraction !is decomposed into simpler fiactions, in the form f= I (x) +x)kIOx +(0~21a] ** k.X + ) + (ha T)k., + [1 Xa] s 2 128 MR. A. CAYLEY'S RESEARCHES ON THE PARTITION OF NUMBERS. where I(x) denotes the integral part, and the &c. refers to the fractional terms depending upon the other multiple factors, such as [IXa] k. The functions Ox are to be considered as functions with indeterminate coefficients, the degree of each such function being inferior by unity to that of the corresponding denominator; and it is proper to remark that the number of the indeterminate coefficients in all the functions Ox together is equal to the degree of the denominatorfx. The term (x)k1 Ox may be reduced to the form [1Xa] gx _g1x + &c the functions gx being of the samie degree as Ox, and the coefficients of these functions being linearly connected with those of the function Ox. The first of the foregoing terms is the only terini on the right-hand side which contains the denominator [1 _Xa]k; hence, multiplying by this denominator and then writing [I _Xa] =0, we find f-xgx, which. is true when x is any root whatever of the equation [1 -xa] =O. Now by means of the equation [1 'Xa] =0oJ may be expressed in the form of a rational and integral function Gx, the degree of which is less by unity than that of L[ I We have therefore Gx=gx, an equation which is satisfied by each root of [1 -xa]=0., and which is therefore an identical equation ; gX is thus determined, and the coefficients of Ox being linear functions of those of gx, the function Ox may be considered as determined. And this being so, the function qx (OXx)kC1 Ox fx~~~~~a will be a fraction the denominator of which does not contain any power of [1 -xa] higher than [1 _Xa]k-; and therefore Oix can be found in the same way as Ox, and similarly 02x, and so on. And the fractional parts being determined, the integral part may be found by subtracting from fi the suitn of the fractional parts, so that the fx fraction qx can by a direct process be decomposed in the above-mentioned form. Particular terms in the decomposition of certain fractions may be obtained with great facility. Thus m being a prime number, assume (1 -x2) (I -X3) @ (I -XM) [I@ F-XMI then observing that (I_-m)=(I )[I amen we have for [1 -Sx] =0, Ox(I .. X ~m1) MR. A. CAYLEY'S RESEARCHES ON THE PARTITION OF NUMBERS. 129 Now u being any quantitywwhatever and x being aroot of [ -xm =Owe have identically [1 -am]= (UX) (U_2) . . (U_X-1)e and therefore putting u=zl, we have M=(I x)(l X2)..(I Xm-1), and therefore 1 ox= ml whence 1 ' 1 (X2) (3).(l.m) +c m [1ElXm] Again, m being as before a prime number, assume 1 ~~~~+Ox (1-X)(12 xm) = -&c + we have in this case for [1-xm]='O ox= which is immediately reduced to Ox=1 i Now M 1-X, -1m] 1-e ]-[I =( + u+ k U-2) + 1+ Ul.U. + U-U) X.. +(1 + U)X + X; or putting u= 1, m 1_-m-1 +m-2x.. +xm2; and substituting this in the value of Ox, we find 1 1 (m-1)+(m-2)x..+Xm-2 (-X) (1 _w ) . l m) &C. + mX=-] The preceding decomposition of the frac tion ,xZ gives very readily the expansion of the fraction in ascending powers of x. For, consider a fraction such as Ox [1 iXa]' where the degree of the numerator is in general less by unity than that of the denominator; we have 1X-Xa= [1-Xa]H[1 Xa]3 where a' denotes any divisor of a (including unity, but not including the number a itself). The fraction may therefore be written under the form OXU [1 _ Xa ] where the degree of the numerator is in general less by unity than that of the denominator, i. e. is equal to a1. Suppose that b is any divisor of a (including unity, but not including the number a itself), then 1 -. is a divisor of 1IF1i -xa'], and 130 MR. A. CAYLEY'S RESEARCHES ON THE PARTITION OF NUMBERS. therefore of the numerator of the fraction. Hence representing this numerator by AO+ Aix... +Aa-iza-11 and putting a=bc, we have (corresponding to the case b=1) AO+A,+A2.. .+Aa -10O and generally for the divisor b, AO+Ab...+A =0 AO+Ab+l.+A(c0I)bl =0 Ab-i+A2b-1+Acb-1=-O Suppose now that aq denotes a circulating element to the period a, i. e. write aq=1 q=0 (mod. a) a=0o in every other case. A function such as Aoaq+Alaq1... +Aa-iaq-a+i will be a circulating function, or circulator to the period a, and may be represented by the notation (A0, A,, ...Aa.I) circlor aq* In the case however where the coefficients A satisfy, for each divisor b of the number a, the above-mentioned equations, the circulating function is what I call a prime circulator, and I represent it by the notation (A0, A1, .Aai) per aq. By means of this notation we have at once coefficient xq in _. (AO, A1..Aai1) pcr aq, and thence also coefficient xq in (x;)r [jXlo] =q'(A0, Ai..Aai) per anq Hence assuming that in the fraction f the degree of the numerator is less than that of the denominator (so that there is not any integral part), we have coefficient x in f=2 q'(Ao, A,, ...AaI) per a; or, if we wish to put in evidence the non-circulating part arising from the divisor a= 1, coefficient x in PX= Aql'+Bq"-2... + Lq+M + > qr(Ao, Al...Aa-1) per aq; where k denotes the number of the factors 1 -xm in the denominator fx, a is any divisor (unity excluded) of one or more of the indices m; and for each valueof a r extends from r=O to r-k1, where k denotes the number of indices m of which MR. A. CAYLEY'S RESEARCHES ON THE PARTITION OF NUMBERS. 131 a is a divisor. The particular results previously obtained show, that m being a prime number, coefficient Xq in _.2) (1 m)= & (-IO,, pcr +nm and coefficient xq in (lx) ( 2 &C.+ (m-1 ,-I 1,..) per mq. Suppose, as before, that the degree of px is less than that offx, and let the analytical expression above obtained for the coefficient of xd in the expansion in ascending powers of x of the fraction -A. be represented by Fq, it is very remarkable that if we fx~ ~~~f expand fZ in descending powers of x, then the coefficient of x? in this new expansion (q is here of course negative, since the expansion contains only negative powers of x) is precisely equal to Fq; this is in fact at once seen to be the case with respect to each of the partial fractions into which fi has been decomposed, and it is conseftc quently the case with respect to the fraction itself*. This gives rise to a result of some importance. Suppose that Ox andfx are respectively of the degrees N and D; it is clear from the form offx that we havef()=(-)Dx-DfX; and I suppose that px is also such that p = (?)N`-Npx; then writing D-N=h, and supposing that is expanded in descending powers of x, so that the coefficient of Xq in the expansion is -Fq, it is in the first place clear that the expansion will commence with the term x-h, and we must therefore have Fq= 0 for all values of q firom q= -1 to q= (h1). Consider next the coefficient of a term X-h-q where q is 0 or positive; the coefficient in question, the value of which is -F(h-,q), is obviously equal to the coefficient I of Xh+q in the expansion in ascending powers of x of X i. e. to (?)NtD _ coefficient xl+Y in or what is the same thing, to (?)N( )? coefficient Xq in and we have therefore, q being zero or positive, F(-h--q) = -(?)N( )DFq. In particular, when px= 1, Fq=O * The property is a fundamental one in the general theory of developments. 132 MR. A. CAYLEY'S RESEARCHES ON THE PARTITION OF NUMBERS. for all values of q from q= 1 to q=-(D-1); and q being 0 or positive, F(-D-q)=(-) )D-lFq. The preceding investigations show the general form of the function P(a, b, c, ...)q, viz. that P(a, b, c, .)q(AqA-A+Bq..+Lq+M+: q(A,,A,.. A11) pcr lq, a formula in which k denotes the number of the elements a, b, c, .. &c., and 1 is any divisor (unity excluded) of one or more of these elements; the summation in the case of each such divisor extends from r=O to r=k1, where k is the number of the elements a, b, c, ... &c. of which I is a divisor; and the investigations indicate how the values of the coefficients A of the prime circulators are to be obtained. It has been moreover in effect shown, that if D=a+b+c+.., then, writing for shortness P(q) instead of P(a, b, c, ..)q, we have P(q)=O for all values of q from qI to q=-(D-1), and that q being 0 or positive, P(-D _q) r(_D1P(q) these last theorems are however uninterpretable in the theory of partitions, and they apply only to the analytical expression for P(q).

Received April 14,-Read May 3 and 10, 1855. I proceed to discuss the following problem: "To find in how many ways a number q can be made up as a sum of m terms with the elements 0, 1, 2, ...k, each element being repeatable an indefinite number of times." The required number of partitions is represented bv P(o, 1, 2, ..k)mq, and the number of partitions of q less the number of partitions of q1 is represented by P'(0, 1,2, ..k5)mq.

Writing -xm for z, and substituting the resulting value of (-XM+ 1)(1XM+2) ( m~k) in the formula for P(O, 1, 2, ..k)mq, we have P(O, 1, 2, ..k)mq==Ej(_)s coefficient L in ( ) 2)1 ((1 k+s) where the summation extends from s= 0 to s=k; but if for any value of s between these limits sm+ s(s+ 1) becomes greater than q, then it is clear that the summation need only be extended from s=O to the last preceding value of s, or what is the same thing, fromn s=O to the greatest value ouf s, for which q-sms(s+1) is positive or zero. It is obvious, that if q > km, then P(0, 1, 2 .k)q=0; and moreover, that if d -V Akmn, then P(0), 1, 2, ... k)md=P(o, 1, 2..k)m n .k-......... so that we tmay always suppose q-l'km. I write therefore q= (km-a) where a is zero or a positive integer not greater than kmn, and is even or odd according as km is even or odd. Substituting this value of q and making a slight change in the forin of the result, we have j ioc+is.8+1 P(O, 1, 2..k)f(lm-A)=:S(, (-1o)(1f2)-(1x)(I X)(12)s( kis)f where the summation extends from s=O to the greatest value of s, for which (q-k-s)m Is(s+ 1) is positive or zero. But we may, if we please, consider the summation as extending, when k is even, from s=O to s,-lk-1, and when k is odd, from s=O to s=I(k1), the terms corresponding to values of s greater than the greatest value for which (kk-s)mr -s(s+ 1) is positive or zero, being of course equal to zero. It may be noticed, that the fraction will be a proper one if a < (k-s) (k s+ 1); or substituting for s its greatest value, the fraction will be a proper one for all values of s, if, when k is even, %<k-k(k+2), and when k is odd, oc<4(k+1)(kt3). We have in a simila r manner, P'(O, 2 ... k)mqcoefficient xzq min 1(which leads to r $~~~~~~~~ ~ ~ ~~ia+8(3 1 ) P'(0, 1 2. k)m 1 (km -a Y) =cEs (_)s coeff.

The condition, in order that the fraction may be a proper one for all values of s, is, when k is even, r + 1 < k(k+2), and when k is od, c+ 1 < (k+ ) (k+ 3). T 2 136 MR. A. CAYLEY'S RESEARCHES ON THE PARTITION OF NUMBERS. To transform the preceding expressions, I write when k is odd x2 instead of x, and I put for shortness 0 instead of lk-s or 2(Qks), and y instead of 2lv+s(s+1) or &,+s(s+l); we have to consider an expression of the form coefficient xi0d in where Fx is the product of factors of the form I-x-. Suppose that a' is the least common multiple of a and 0, then (1Xa') (1 _xa) is an integral function of a, equal Xx suppose, and 1I (1. a)Zx?(l xa'). Making this change in all the factors of Fx which require it (i. e. in all the factors except those in which a is a multiple of 0), the general term becomes coefficient xam in eHx, where Gx is a product of factors of the form I _~Xa', in which a' is a multiple of O, i. e. Gx is a rational and integral function of x0. But in the numerator xvHx we may reject, as not contributing to the formation of the coefficient of X7m, all the terms in which the indices are not multiples of 0; the numerator is thus reduced to a rational and integral function of x@, and the general ternm is therefore of the form coefficient x6m in ) or what is the same thing, of the form coefficient xm in XX Where zx is the product of factors of the form I -x , and ax is a rational and integral function of x, the particular value of the fraction depends on the value of s,; and uniting the different terms, we have anexpression coefficient xm in Ss (-)4 AZ which is equivalent to. coefficient x", in wherefx is a product of factors of the form 1 -xl, and px is a rational and integral function of x. And it is clear that the fiaction will be a proper one when each of the fractions in the original expression is a proper fraction, i. e. in the case of P(O, 1,2..k)ml(krnm), when fork even a< k(k+2), and forkodd a<4(k+1)(k+3); and in the case of P'(O, 1, 2 .. k)m (km -c4), when for k even a +1 <?k(k+2), and for k odd a+ I <I(k+ 1)(k+3). We see, therefore, that P(o, 1, 2 .k)m (kmn .x) and P'(o, 1, 2 .. k)m (km M), are each of them of the form coefficient xm in By. MR. A. CAYLEY'S RESEARCHES ON THE PARTITION OF NUMBERS. 137 wherefx is the product of factors of the form 1 -x4, and up to certain limiting values of M the fraction is a proper fraction. When the fraction jx; is known, we may therefore obtain by the method employed in the former part of this Memoir, analytical expressions (involving prime circulators) for the functions P and P'. As an example, take P(O, 1,2, 3)m3 m, which is equal to coefficient x3m in 1_2) 4) _6) -coefficient xm in( 1-) X2) 1 4) The multiplier for the first fraction is (1-X6) (1-X12) (I _ 2) _i-4) which is equal to I +x2+2X4+x6+2xs+xo+x 12. Hence, rejecting in the numerator the terms the indices of which are not divisible by 3, the first term becomes 1 ? X6+ X12 coefficient x3m in (lx6 . 12)(L 6)' or what is the same thing, the first term is coefficient xm in X4) and the second term being -coefficient xm in (1 -12)2(1 X)' we have P(o, 1,2, 3)mm= coefficient xmin And similarly it may be shown, that P(O, 1, 2) 3)m 1 (3m1) = coefficient xm in ( +] ) As another example, take P'(O, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5)AM, which is equal to coefficient xem in 1_X4) X) X10) -coefficient X'3m in (1 (1) X4) X) (1 ) +coefficient xm, in (I X2) (I X4) X4) _6) The multiplier for the first fraction is (1 20) (1 X30) (1X40) 138 MR.

Wz + 2X*4 + SO + x1s + x10. -coefficient in (1-2)l2(1-x4)(I-X8)7 and the third term is coefficient xm in 1-a)(14)12X6) Now the fractions may be reduced to a common denominator (1 -X2)(I -X4)(1 _-6)(1 -X8) 1X6 by multiplying the terms of the second fraction by 1_,(= I +x'2+x%) and the terms of the third fraction by 1lX4(=I+x'4); performing the operations and adding, the numerator and denominator of the resulting fraction will each of them contain the factor 1 -x2; and casting this out, we find P(0, 1,2, 3, 4, 5%-Tm= coefficient xm in (1 )(1 ) (1 8) I have calculated by this method several other particular cases, which are given in my "Second Memoir upon Quantics ;" the present researches were in fact made for the sake of their application to that theory.
