Monsieur Auzout's Judgment touching the Apertures of Object-Glasses, and their Proportions, in respect of the several Lengths of Telescopes. This Author, observing in a small French Tract lately written by him to a Countryman of his, Monfieur L Abbe Charles; That great Optick Glasses have almost never as great an Aperture as the small ones, in proportion to what they Magnifie, and that therefore they must be more dim; takes occasion to inform H 2 the (56) the Reader, that he hath found, that the Apertures, which OptickGlasses can bear with distinctness, are in about a subduplicate proportion to their Lengths; whereof he tells us he intends to give the reason and demonstration in his Diopticks, which he is now writing, and intends to finish, as soon as his Health will permit. In the mean time, he presents the Reader with a Table of such Apertures; which is here exhibited to the Consideration of the Ingenious, there being of this French Book but one Copy, that is known, in England.
