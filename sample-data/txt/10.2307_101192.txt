Of a considerable Load-stone digged out of the Ground in Devonshire. THis Stone was lately sent up out of the said County, and presented to the R. Society by the Reverend Arch-deacon, Doctor Edrv. Cotton, with this description, That it weighs 60 pounds; and that, though it take up no great weight, yet it moves a Needle about nine Foot distant. Some part of it being broken off, he hath sent up also, because (saith he) being put in its proper place, it adds much strength to it, but without that addition it moves not much more than seven Foot. Care will be had, that Tryals be made of the Vertue of this Stone, both of the two pieces closed together, and of each piece separately, and that uncapped as well as capped.
