111. An Account of some Peculiarities in the Structure of the Organ of Hearing in the Balcena Mysticetus of Linneus. By Everard, Home, Esq. F. R. S. Read December 12, i181. I N the year 1 799, I laid before the Society some observations on the Structure of the Membrana Tympani, in consequence of having found that 'in the elephant that membrane has a muscular structure. In the elephant the meinbrana tymnpani has a greater breadth thaan in any other animal I have had an opportunity of exam mining; the structure of its different parts is therefore rendered more conspicuous, which enabled me to discover the muscular fibres. With a view to prosecute this inquiry, I have ever since that time been desirous of an opportunity of examining the membrana tympani in the balena mysticetus, having no doubt of its being of such extent as to shew the structure to advantage ; and by the kind attention of Mr. SCORESBY, Jun. of Whitby, I have now succeeded: that gentleman in his last voyage in the Greenland whale fishery, procured for me the cranium of a cub of the balena mysticetus whose extreme length was from, sixteen to seventeen feet, and its circumference from twelve to thirteen -feet. This cranium was put into a cask of salt water, and arrived in London in good condition, the different parts of the organ of hearing being in a state fitted for dis2;ection.. ... M 84 Mr. HOME on the, Organ of Hearing In my examination of the organ of hearing in this young w%!hale, I find there is a peculiarity in its mechanism not met with in the smaller species of whale, and to which there is: ilothing similar in other animals. As this very singular mechanism is not noticed by either CAMPER or MONRO, and is only glanced at by HUNTER, to whom it was imperfectly. known, I shall give a description of it, and in doing so, mention the other parts of the organ, so far as will be necessary to make myself understood. The cranium had been deprived of the external skin, consequently the outward aperture of the ear had been removed; a very small portion, however, of the external meatuscould have been cut off, since the dark coloured cuticular lining, which is a continuation of the outward covering of the head, extended a little way into the tube. The meatus externuss was five inches and: a half long, and. probably an inch had been cut oWf. Near this part the tube was one quarter of an inch in diameter, in the middle it was. narrower, and .near the membrana tympani one inch and oneXthird of an inch. By comparing the measurement of the length of the tube with that of the skull in this whale, and with the large skull int the Hunterian. Museum, the meatus externus in the full: grown: whale will be found to be about two feet six inches in length.6, The memnbrana tympani is one inch and one-tenth of an inch in diameter, where it is attached to the bone; instead of being concave, as in other animals, towards the meatus externus$ it is convex, and projects nearly an inch into that tube. Its external surface is composed of a smooth firm cuticular in the LFhale-ibone Whake-, 85 Covering which readily separates as soon as putrefaction comes on; 9 under this is a strong compact membrane, and when that is removed there is a regular layer of -muscular filbres ; these go over the Wholeof the embossed part,, having their origin at the edge of tlthe bone to which the membrane ins attached, and terminatinig-in the bone on the opposite side. This arranges mlent of muscular fibres,,differs fromthat of the elephant, where the central part is tendinous. The muscular fibres have a membranous lining between them and the cavity of the tympanum. From; this description of the membrana tympani, it is evident that there is -no connexion between it and the ossiculaauditus', or small bones of the ear, which Mr. HUNTER SUpposed to. be the case in consequence of having found that it was so inr the porpoise.*H e says," in the piked-whale the"& membrana tympani; is projecting, and returns back into the "meatus externus for abovean inch in length, is firm in tex"ture with thick coats, is hollow on the inside, andits mouth commnunicating with the tympanum, one side being fixed to "' the malleus, similar to the tendiinous process which goes from; "the inside of the membrana tympani in the others." The fact is, that there is no connexion whatever between the membrana tympani and the malleus, as will be explained;. but as that circumstance forms the great ipeculiarity in the organ. of this species of whale, I thought it right to quote what he had. stated on this subject. Having. pointed, out that there is, no direct connexion be*m tween the membbrana tympanii and, the ossicula. auditi .s, as ina.*'Observations on the Structure and Mconomy of Whalea. Phil. Trana. Vp!. LXXVII P. 7p 373I f3G Mr. lOME on the Organ -of Hearing other animals, and also shewn that fuNTER, unwilling to believe that there could be so great a deviation from the ordinary construction of this organ, was led into an error, which I can only attribute to his having formed to himself too strong a chain of analogies, I shall proceed in my description of the organ. Immediately behind the membrana tympani is a large cavity formned principally by the concave surface of a large hard bone peculiar to the whale, in the substance of which there is more earthy matter than in almost any other bone met with in animal bodies. In its form it is not very unlike the shell called the concha Veneris, to which it has been compared. The cavity of the tympanum is of an oval shape, one endof which is bounded by the miembrana tympani, the other forms the entrance of the Eustachian tube, and there the cavity is surrounded wholly by membrane inclosed in the substance of the skull. The large concave bone is only slightly connected with the petrous portion of the temporal -bone, and is imbedded in a fatty substance of nearly an inch in thickness, with a stnooth external surface. The Eustachian tube is two inches and a half long, it opens externally into the canal leading to the blow-hole; its internal surface is honey-combed, which gives it a glandular appearance, and there are chords and septa crossing from side to side in different places: where it opens into the cavity, it has a valvular structure. The cavity, as it corresponds in its principal uses with the tympanum of other animals, although it does no0t, as in them, contain the ossicula auditcs, deserves to be called by the same name,; it is equal in size to a pint measure, an.d can only be filled from the Eustachian tube, there being tn Ike Whale-bone Whale. no other opening into it by which it can communicate extcrs nally. Within the cavity of the tympanum, close to the bony rim to which the membrana tympani is attached, there is a rnennbranous fold fixed at one end to the centre of a slightprotuberance on the concave surface of the large hollow bonle, aI '( stretched across the cavity, its loose upper edge forming a line across the centre of the hollow of the memnbrana tympani, the other end passing beyond the cavity to be attached to the short handle of the malleus, which is situated imnmediately behind the membranous lining of the tympanumn. The long handle of the malleus is left loose. The incus and stapes have the same relative situation to one another as in the human ear, differing in nothing but being contained in a cavity distinctfrom that of the tympanum. The appearance of an os orbieulare is wanting. The other parts of the-organ, the vestibUlumn, semi-circular canals and cochlea, and the leatus internus throuLgh whichl the nerves from, the brain pass to be distributed to these parts, do not differ materially from what is met with ill the hutman ear. As the parts Which. have been described are delitneated in the annexed drawings, I have been less minute in my description than I should have otherwise thought it necessary to be. From the mechanism which has been described, it is evi4 dent that the impulses made on the membrana tympani arenot immediately communicated to the ossicula audituis as in other animals; they are only communicatedi to the tyrmpanuni and thence to the chord stretched across its cavity. The membrana tympani by its muscular structure has the means within; itself of adjustment to different sounds, wvhile. S8 Mr. HOME -on the Organ of Hearing the ani mal is under water; but the degree of pressure tto which it is liable, is incompatible with the nicer vibrations required to impress the internal organ so as to convey to it distinct sounds, and it is for this last purpose that the meemo brane is stretched across the cavity of the tympanum. This membrane, from being connected with the concave bone, will have its vibrations increased ,and the bone being imbedded in a fatty covering, none of the vibratory motion impressed upon it can be carried off from the opposite side, but the. whole will 'bev tcommunicated to "theimalleus, and so on to the cochlea and -semibcircular canals.
