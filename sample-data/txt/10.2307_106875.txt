[295] XX. A new Method of investigating the Sums of Infinite Series. By the Rev. Samuel Vince, A. M. F. R. S. Read June 2, 1791. THE summation of infinite series is a subject, not only of curious speculation, but also of the greatest importance in the various branches of mathematics and philosophy; in consequence of which it has always claimed a very considerable share of attention from the most celebrated mathematicians. I shall therefore make no apology for offering to the public the following new and very expeditious method, by which we may obtain the sums of a great variety of series, most of which have never before been treated of. As the summation depends on the sums of the reciprocals of the powers of the natural numbers, tables of such sums are given as far as the 40th power to twelve places of decimals, by which the sums of the series will be found true to ten or eleven places; and if greater accuracy were required (which is a case that can very rarely happen) it might easily be obtained by continuing the tables. The first and third columns shew the sums, and the second and fourth the powers corresponding. T A B L E 296 Mr. VINCE on the Sums T A B L E I. Sum of 1/2n + 1/3n + 1/4n + &c. ad infinitum.

A + B + C + D + &c.; but 1/1. 2 + 1/2. 3 + 1/3. 4 + &c. ad inf.=1; hence A + B + C + D + &c. ad inf.=1. R r 2 As 300 Mr. VINCE on the Sums As 1/x X x + 1 = 1/x2 1/x3 + 1/x4 1/x5 + &c. ad inf.; we have, by the same method of proceeding, A B + C D + &c. ad inf.= 1/2; consequently A + C + ~ + &c. = 3/4, and B + D + F + &c. = 1/4. Because 1/x 1 X x = 1/x2 + 1/x3 + 1/x4 + &c. ad inf.; if for x we write 2, 4, 6, &c., then will 1/1. 2 + 1/3. 4 + 1/5. 6 + &c. = (Tab. 3) A'' + B'' + C'' + D'' + &c.; but 1/1. 2 + 1/3. 4 + 1/5. 6 + &c. = hyp. log. 2; hence A'' + B'' + C'' + D'' + &c. = hyp. log. 2. If in the same expression we write 3, 5, 7, &c. for x, then 1/2. 3 + 1/4. 5 + 1/6. 7 + &c. = (Tab. 4.) a'' + b'' + c'' + &c.; but 1/2. 3 + 1/4. 5 + 1/6. 7 + &c. = 1 hyp. 2; hence a'' + b'' + c'' + &c. = 1 hyp. log. 2.-Hence from either of these two last cases, we have a very expeditious method of finding the hyp. log. 2. P R O P. II. To find the sum of the infinite series whose general term is 1/mxr ~ n. By division 1/mxr ~ n = 1/mxr ~ n/m2x2r + ~/m3x3r = n3/m4x4r + &c. ad ins.; hence, if 1/mxr ~ n be made the general term of a series, and for x we write 2, 3, 4, &c., its sum will be equal to the sums of another set of ~, whose terms are the powers of the reciprocals of the natural numbers respectively multiplied into of Infinite Series. 301 into 1/m, n/m2, n2/m3, &c.; hence the sum of each of these series being known from the tables, the sum of the given series will be found. Ex. 1. Let 1/x2 + 1 be the general term; now 1/x + 1 = 1/x2 1/x4 + 1/x6 1/x8 + &c.; hence if for x we write 2, 3, 4, &c. we have 1/5 + 1/10 + 1/17 + 1/26 + &c. = A C + E G + &c. = (by Tab. 1.) ,576674037469. Ex. 2. Let 1/x2 1 be the general term; them; by the same method of proceeding, 1/3 + 1/8 + 1/15 + 1/24 + &c. = A + C + E + &c. = (by Prop. 1.) 3/4. Cor. Because 1/8 + 1/24 + 1/48 + &c. = 1/8 X 1 + 1/3 + 1/6 + &c. = (as 1 + 1/3 + 1/6 + &c. is the reciprocal of the figurative numbers of the second order) 1/8 X 2 = 1/4; therefore 1/3 + 1/15 + 1/35 + &c. = 1/2. Also, as 1/x 1 = 1/x2 + 1/x4 + 1/x6 + &c.; if we write 2, 4, 6, &c. for x, we have 1/3 + 1/15 + 1/35 + &c. = (by Tab. 3.) A'' + C'' + E'' + &c. = 1/2; but, by Prop. 1. A'' + B'' + C'' + D'' + &c. = hyp. log. 2; hence B'' + D'' + F'' + &c. = 1/2 + hyp. log. 2. Ex. 3. Let the general term be 1/x3 1 = 1/x3 + 1/x6 + 1/x9 + &c., and, by writing 2, 3, 4, &c. for x, we have 1/7 + 1/26 + 1/63 + &c. = B + E + H + &c. =,221689395104. Ex. 302 Mr. VINCE on the Sums Ex. 4. Let the general term be 1/3x4 2 = 1/3x4 + 2/9x8 + 4/27x12 + &c., and, by writing 2, 3, 4, &c. for x, &c. we have 1/46 + 1/241 + 1/766 + &c. 1/3C + 2/9G + 4/27L + &c. =,028385252052. Ex. 5. To find the sum of the series 1/9 1/26 + 1/65 1/124 + &c. If we write 2, 3, 4, 5, &c. for x, the general term will be 1/x3 + 1 = 1/x3 1/x6 + 1/x9 1/x12 + &c. Now, by writing 2, 3, 4, 5, &c. for x, the serieses of which 1/x3, 1/x9, &c. are the general terms, will be alternately + and -, and therefore their sums will be found in Tab. 2. and the serieses of which 1/x6, 1/x12, &c. are the general terms will have their terms all +, and therefore their sums will be found in Tab. 1. Hence the sum required = b + h + o + &c. E L R &c. = ,082800931803. PROP. III. To find the sum of the sums of the reciprocals of the odd powers in Tab. 2. By division 1/x 1 x x = 1/x2 + 1/x3 + 1/x4 + 1/x5 + &c.; hence by writing 2, 3, 4, 5, &c. for x, the sums of the serieses of which 1/x3, 1/x, &c. are the general terms, may be found by Tab. 2. and the ~ sums by Tab. 1.; hence 1/1. 2 + 1/3. 4 + 1/5. 6 + &c. = A + C + E + &c. + b + d + f + &c.; but 1/1. 2 + 1/3. 4 + 1/5. 6 + &c. of Infinite Series. 303 &c = 1/2 + 2 hyp. log. 2; and by Prop. 1. A + C + E + &c. = 3/4; hence b + d + f + &c. = 5/4 + 2 hyp. log. 2. PROP. IV. To find the sum of the infinite series whose general term is xs/mxr ~ n. By division xs/mxv ~ n = 1/mxr-s = n/m2x2r-s + n2/m3x3r-s = &c. ad inf.; hence the sum of the series of which xs/mxr ~ n is the general term, is found as in Prop. 2. Here r must be greater than s at least by 2, otherwise the sum will be infinite. Ex. 1. Let the general term be x2/x4 + 1 = 1/x2 1/x6 + 1/x10 &c.; hence if for x we write 2, 3, 4, &c. we have 4/17 + 9/82 + 16/257 + &c. = A E + I N + &c. =,538527924723.-If for x we write 2, 4, 6, &c. we get 4/17 + 16/257 + 36/1296 + &c. = A'' E'' + I'' N'' + &c. =,396257616555. Ex. 2. Let the general term be x/3x3 1 = 1/3x2 + 1/9x5 + 1/27x8 + &c.; hence if we write 2, 3, 4, &c. for x, we have 2/23 + 3/80 + 4/191 + &c. = 1/3A + 1/9D + 1/27G + &c. =,219238483448. By this proposition we may find the sum of any series whose general term is axs + bxs-1 + cxs-2 + &c./mxr ~ n; for this resolves itself into axs/mxr ~ n, bxs-1/mxr ~ n, &c. &c., the sum of each of which series is 6 found 304 Mr. VINCE on the Sums found by this proposition. Now the s + 1 th differences of the numerators of this general term are = 0, and therefore it comprehends all series under such circumstances. For example, let the given series be 4/17 + 13/82 + 26/257 + 43/626. Here the third differences of the numerators = 0; to find therefore the general expression for the numerator, assume ax2 + bx + c for it; and, by writing 2, 3, 4, for x, we have 4a + 2b + c = 4, 9a + 3b + c = 13, 16a + 4b + c = 26; hence a = 2, b = 1, c = 2; and as the denominator is manifestly x4 + 1, the general term will be 2x2 x 2/x4 + 1 = 2x2/x4 + 1 x/x4 + 1 2/x4 + 1, each of which being made the general term of a series, their sum will be found to be respectively 1,077055849446, 0,194173022145, and 0,156955159332; hence the sum of the given series is 0,725927667969. If s be negative, the general term becomes1/xs x mxr ~ n = 1/mxr+s = 1/m2x2r+s + 1/m3x3r+s = &c. Ex. 1. To find the sum of 1/1. 2. 3 1/2. 3. 4 + 1/3. 4. 5 &c. ad inf. Here the general term is 1/x 1 x x x x + 1 = 1/x x x2 1 = 1/x3 + 1/x5 + 1/x7 + &c.; hence, by writing 2, 3, 4, 5, &c. for x, we have the sum = b + a + f + &c. = (by Prop. 3.) 5/4 + 2 hyp. log. 2. If 1/x 1 x x3 x x + 1 be the general term it resolves itself into 1/x5 + 1/x7 + 1/x9 + &c.; consequently the sum of 1/1. 23. 3 1/2. 33. 4 + of Infinite Series. 305 + 1/3. 43. 5 &c. = b 5/4 + 2 hyp. log. 2. In like manner the sum of 1/1. 25. 3 1/2. 35. 4 + 1/3. 45. 5 &c. = b d 5/4 + 2 hyp. log. 2. Thus we may proceed as far as we please by adding two powers to the middle term; and hence this remarkable property of the serieses, that the difference of the sums of the serieses where the middle term is x, x3, x5, &c. is b, d, f, &c. respectively. Ex. 2. In like manner if the general term be 1/x 1xx3xx+1' and we write 2, 3, 4, &c. for x, we have 1/1. 23. 3 + 1/2. 33. 3 + 1/3. 43. 5 + &c. = D + F + H + &c. = (by Prop. 1.) 1/4 B. Hence also 1/1. 2~. 3 + 1/2. 3. 4 + &c. = 1/4 B D; and so on as before. If the general term be under the form 1/xn. x + m, it will be most convenient to resolve it thus: by division 1/x + m = 1/x m/x2 + m2/x3 &c. = mn/xn. x + m; hence = 1/xn. x + m = 1/x + m 1/x + m/x2 m2/x3 + &c. x 1/mn = m/x. x + m + m/x2 m2/x3 + &c. x 1/mn, where the sign on the left hand will be + or according as n is even or odd, and the number of terms on the right is = n. Now the sum of the series whose general term is m/x. x + m is well known, and the sums of the other are found from the tables. Ex. 1. To find the sum of 1/22. 3 + 1/32. 4 + 1/42. 5 + &c. ad inf. VOL. LXXXI. S s Here 306 Mr. VINCE on the Sums Here the general term is 1/x2 x x + 1 = 1/x. x+1 + 1/x2, and by writing 2, 3. 4, &c. for x, we have the sum = -1/2. 3 1/3. 4 &c. + A = 1/2 + A. In like manner 1/23. 3 + 1/42. 5 + 1/6. 7 + &c. = 1 + hyp.log.2 + A''. Also 1/23. 5 + 1/33. 6 + 1/43. 7 + &c. = 13/12 3A + 9Bx 1/27. If m be negative, then 1/xn. x m = m/x. x m m/x2 m2/x3 &c. x 1/mno Hence 1/24. 1 + 1/34 2 + 1/44. 3 + &c. = 1 A B C; and so on for others of the same kind. If the general term be under this form 1/x~. axn + m, then, in like manner, we have = 1/x~. axn + m = 1/axn + m 1/axn + m/a2x2n &c. x ar/mr, where the sign on the left hand will be + or -, according as r is even or odd, and the number of terms on the right is = r + 1. Ex. 1. To find the sum of 1/24. 5 + 1/34. 10 + 1/44. 17 + &c. Here m = 1, n = 2, r = 2, a = 1, and the general term 1/x4 x x2 + 1 = 1/~ 1/x2 + 1/x4; now the sum of the series whose general term is 1/x2 + 1 is =, 576674037469, by Prop. 2.; consequently the sum required =, ~ A + C =, 014063204332. Ex. 2. If the given series be 1/4. 5 + 1/9. 10 + 1/16. 17 + &c. the general of Infinite Series. 307 general term will be 1/x2. x + 1 = 1/x2 + 1 + 1/x2; hence, by writing 2, 3, 4, &c. for x, we have the sum = -, 576674037469 + A =,06826002938. If m be negative, then 1/x~, axn m = 1/axn m 1/axn m/a2x2n &c. x ar/mr. Ex. 1. To find the sum of 1/1. 22. 3 + 1/2. 32. 4 + 1/3. 42. 5 + &c. Here the general term is 1/x 1 x x2 x x + 1 = 1/x2 x x2 1 = 1/x2 1 1/x2; now, by writing 2, 3, 4, &c. for x, the sum of the series whose general term is 1/x2 1 is = 3/4, by Prop. 2.; hence the sum required = 3/4 A. Ex. 2. Let the given series be 1/1. 22. 3 + 1/3. 42. 5 + 1/5. 62. 7 + &c. Here the general term is the same as before, writing 2, 4, 6, &c. for x; and, by Prop. 2. the sum of the series whose general term is 1/x2 1 is = 1/2; hence the sum = 1/2 A''. Ex. 3. In like manner the sum of the series 1/1. 24. 3 + 1/2. 34. 4 + 1/3. 44. 5 + &c. =, 221689395104 B. Ex. 4. To find the sum of 1/3. 42. 5 + 1/8. 92. 10 + 1/15. 162. 17 + &c.

Let ~ be the general term, then resolve ~/~ into an infinite series, and take the fluent on both sides; then write 2, 3, 4, &c. for x, and one side will become the hyp. log. of the given series, and the value of the other side may be found from the tables. Ex. 1. To find the value of 4/3 X 9/8 X 16/15 X &c. ad infinitum. Here the general term is x2/x2-1; hence ~/~ = 2x/x3-x = 2x/x3 2x/x5 2x/x7 &c.; hence the hyp. log. x2/x2-1 = 1/x2 + 1/2x4 + 1/3x6 + &c. Write 2, 3, 4, &c. for x, and we have the hyp. log. 4/3 + hyp. log. 9/8 + hyp. log. 16/15 + &c. = A + 1/2C + 1/3E + &c. =,693147180574, which is the hyp. log. 2; but hyp. log. 4/3 + hyp. log. 9/8 + hyp. log. 16/15 + &c. = hyp. log. 4/3 X 9/8 X 16/15 X &c. consequently 4/3 X 9/8 X 16/15 X &c. = 2. Ex. 2. To find the value of 8/7 X 27/26 X 64/63 X &c. ad infinitum. Here the general term is x3/x3-1; hence ~/~ = 3x/x4-x = 3x/x4 3x/x7 3x/x10 &c.; hence the hyp. log. x3/x3-1 = 1/x3 + 1/2x6 + 1/3x9 + &c. Write 2, 3, 4, &c. for x, and we have hyp. log. 8/7 + hyp. log. 27/26 of Infinite Series. 315 27/26 + hyp. log. 64/63 + &c. = B+1/2E+1/3H+&c. =,211466250444; or hyp. log. 8/7 X 27/26 X 64/63 X &c. =,211466250444; hence 8/7 X~ 27/26 X 64/63 X &c. = 1,627295, &c. Hence we may find the value of such a quantity, supposing the number of factors to be finite. Ex. To find the value of 2/1 X 4/3 X 6/5 X &c..... to 2x/2x-1. Here the general term being 2x/2x-1, we have ~/~ = x/2x2~x = x/2x2 x/4x3 x/8x4 x/16x5 &c.; hence hyp. log. 2x/2x-1 = 1/1. 2x + 1/2. 4x2 + 1/3. 8x3 + 1/4. 16x4 + &c.. Now write 2, 3, 4, &c. for x, and we have the hyp. log. 4/3 X 6/5 X 8/7 X &c..... 2x/2x-1 = 1/2 X 1/2 + 1/3 + 1/4 +..... 1/x + 1/2. 4 X 1/22 + 1/32 + 1/42 +..... 1/x2 + 1/3. 8 X 1~23 + 1/33 + 1/43 +..... 1/x3 + &c. &c. &c.

Ex. Let x = 10000; then 1/2 hyp. log. x = 4,605170185988 const. quant. =,120782237640 4,484387948348 1/8n =,000012498750 1/8n2 =,000000001249 4,484400448347 the natural number corresponding to which hyp. log. is 88,6238, &c., consequently 2/1 X 4/3 X 6/5 X..... 20000/19999 = 177,2476. If x be a very large number, it may be sufficiently exact in most cases to take twice the natural number corresponding to the hyp. log. of 1/2 hyp. log. x-,120782237640.
