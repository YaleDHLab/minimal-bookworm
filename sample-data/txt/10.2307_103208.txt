An Extract of a Letter from the late Mr. Edward Lhwyd, to Dr. Richard Richardson; containing some Remarks on an Undescribed Plant, and other Particulars, observed by him in Wales. Gogerdhan in Cardiganshire, April 18. 1699. S I R, I Have here sent you the Draught of a remarkable Sea Plant, which we met with a dredging for Oysters near Lhan Danwg in Meirionydshire. The whole Plant is of a Straw colour, and much of the bigness the Figure represents it. The Stems are hollow, and filled with a kind of thick reddish Liquor, as much like Blood [or Gore] as the Juice of Plants; insomuch, that it seems referrable to the Zoophyts. If you press these Stems at the Bottom betwixt your Fingers, the red Liquor is forced up, and causes the drooping Flowers [or Seed-vessels] to mount erect. Tab VI. Fig. 7. We have lately discovered a sort of Marble in that County, which when polished represents a number of small Oranges cut across; the reason whereof is an infinite quantity of Porus [or Alcyonium] stuck through the Stone. This might serve very well for Inlaying Work, as Tables, Windows, Cabinets, Closets, &c. and would make curious Saltsellers. If you are acquainted with any Gentlemen that deal in Alum or Copperas, you may please to acquaint them N n ~ that (276) that Wales affords good quantity of each, if they judge it worth their while to put up any Works there; particularly Pembrokeshire and Caermarthenshire for the former, and Meirionydshire for Copperas, where I saw a great Vein of Pyrites strongly impregnated.
