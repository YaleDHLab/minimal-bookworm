[637] XXI. An Account from James Burrow Esq; F.R.S. of what Mr. Boyfield told him concerning the late Earthquake. Friday, March 16, 1749. MR. Josiah Boyfie d, of GravelLane, near St. George's Fields, Southwark, told me, that at the Time of the Earthquake, on Thursday Morning the 8th instant, he was not far from his Canal, and that it was a clear still Morning; the Air (as he expressed it) as clear as a Bell, with not a Breath of Wind stirring. As clear as a Bell, except that small Haziness which there almost always is in the Morning-Air. Read March 22. 1749. He heard, he said, a great Noise like Thunder; which he at first took to be the Report of ShipGuns; and immediately after the Ground shook and trembled under him, and he heard his Men say, Look at the Fish. The Sound came from the SouthEast, and moved to the West or North-West, over Westminster: It went off rattling like ten thousand Cannon; and he thought that Westminster-Abbey, and all that Part of the Town was coming down. The Sound preceded the Motion, and was ended before the Motion ceased. He went, he says, nearer to the Canal, and saw the Water much disturbed; but he did not himself actually see the Fish leap out of the Water: However, some of his Men, whose Account he can depend upon,saw several Roach leap up, and saw the Fish in [638] in general shoot away in all Sorts of Directions, and seem to shift for themselves, as if they were frighted and alarmed at what had happened.
