VII. Demonstration of a Theorem, by which such Portions ojtide Solidity of a Sphere are assigned as admit an algebraic Expression. By Robert Woodhouse, A -M. Fellow of Ca>is College, Canbridge. Communicated by Joseph Planta, Esq. Sec. R. S. Read February 12, i8oi. IN 1692, a problem was proposed by VIVIANI, (Act. ErudL Lips.) to the geometricians of his time, -in which it was required to separate from the surface of a sphere, such portions, that what remained should be quadrable. In the second volume of the Memoirs of the National Institute, M. BOSSUT announces a theorem relative to the solidity of a sphere, very simple, he says, and as remarkable as VIVIANI'S, but depending on an integration much more complicated: the theorem is this. "If a sphere be pierced perpendicularly to the plane of one of its great circles, by two cylinders of which theaxes pass through the middle -points of two radii that compose a diameter of this great circle, the two portions, thus taken away from the whole solidity of the sphere, leave a remainder equal to twoninths of the cube of the sphere's diameter." .M. BosSUT withholds the analysis that led to this result. I have obtained it in the subjoined process, in which the integration is not at all more complicated than what is used in the solution of the Florentine problem. MDCCCI. X ASH Mr. WooDnous,'s Demotnstration of a Theorer Let x, y, z be three rectangular co-ordinates, that determine the position of any particle of a solid, body relatively to any three fixed axes, then the element of the solidity may be repre-4 sented by the paralellopiped z X; hence, s (solidity) =fff x; which triple integral must be taken first relatively to z, supposing y and x constant; next, relatively toy, supposing x constant, having previously substituted in the function of z, for z, its value in terms of x and y; and, lastly, relatively to x, having previously substituted in the function ofy, fory, its value in terms of x. The order of these integrations may be varied at pleasure. In the present case, let the origin of the co-ordinates be the centre of the sphere; then s =fff,? c =ff (z'z)y ; and, if the integral be taken from the plane of x and y, where z = to the surface of the sphere, where z= z', s =ff z' x; but the equation to the surface of the sphere is z' Vie rz_ .; hence, s =ff V r ' *. Without the aid of some tr ansformation, it would be extremely difficult to find the value of this double integral: the transiformation is to be effected in thefollowing manner. In the expression z', suppose first x = funct. (ye, e) R; then, regarding y as constant, ., (R ) e . zan 'A V R) and, when its integral is to be taken relatively to a, the value of = R must be substituted for x in z' or Vr7 7Z7. Again, lety funct. (e, 0) =Q .i. considering , constant, = (t)o; ;hence,z' = y ' ( ) g (Q)0; and, to integrate, substitute for y its valuie '(Q)3 inz' (,_). The expressio n 9X y is thus transformed into another, relative to two variable assigning certain Portions of a Sphere, ; quantities, e and 0; and, since we have x R funct. (Y, 0 y = Q = funct. (g, 0), x and y may be-deduced functions of q andO.

To obtain a particular solution in the present case, let the co-ordinates x and y be transformed into a radius vector e, and an angle 0, which e makes with Z; . x=cos.0 y sin.

In the present problem, this latter curve is given to be a semicircle -described on r as a diameter; hence, as e is a line drawn from an extremity of this diameter to the circumference, man king an angle 0 with the diameter, we have, by similar figures, tang. 0(t) = r but G i+t 3 O *Hences-f f) s 03)e C __ 3 ~ 3 :. r 37 + ,' when -o-2-thevalue oftheportion 9 9 , 9 of the solid insisting on a base in the plane of x and y, and the bounding lines of which are a -quadrantal arc, (rad. r) a semicircle, (diam. r) and a radius (r) perpendicular to the diameter * If is: expressed in terms of t and j, the integration is less simple; fors = ~t~ _ =rt z3 (I+ to) ^ -_fluxion (P2 tI + A)a ,2 73 ( 1 7,3" f r.V)7 + -t g t (1 + As)-; -, S =_ 94 t 3 _ 29r Xcorrection 9X when the integral is taken from t _ o to tc=. assigning certain Portions of a Sphere. 1,57 of the semicircle: hence, for the whole sphere, 8 s = 8 9 X (2 r)'-= (diameter)", which is the result the theorem announces. 1. The transformation* of z xy into z' (R) (t e 0, in the present case, may be avoided by originally taking the element of the solidity differently thus, if , be the incremental arc described with radius g, the element of the solidity z = (since ,:O :: i: i) z'??O=V'r2 0; whence s =ffVr g Oas before. 2. The intersection of the surfaces of the cylinder and sphere is a curve of double curvature, of which the two equations are *~~~ aI y = (r x a) and z (r rm)2; and hence it appears, that the same curve may likewisebe formed by the intersection of the surfaces of two cylinders, one perpendicular to the plane of x and y on a circular base, the other perpendicular to the plane of x and z on a parabolic base. 3. The area of the curve of doublecurvature =ftz( +y)2 Y) xW+Ly T Jrz x7,when x =r, =r; this area is the surface-of half the cylinder included in the hemisphere, and therefore the surface of the two cylinders included in the sphere _ 8 re.* The method of finding triple -and double integrals, is not confined to the solution of merely geometrical problems like the present. The attraction of an elliptical spheroid depends on the formula ff-M km; and, by integrating it, M. LAG RANGO (Mem. de Berlin,) and M. LsG E N D RP (Mem. de l'Acad. 1788), gave the analytical solution of the problem of the attraction of a spheroid, which MACLAVU iN had solved, in his Treatise of the Tides, on purely geometrical principles. i58 Mr. WOoDmOUSE's Demonstration of a Theorem, &c. 4.
