[652] XXX. Extract of a Letter from a Gentleman at Southampton to Josiah Colebrooke, Apothecary, F. R. S. of the Shocks felt in those Parts, March 18 and 19. 1749-50. March 19. 1749. WE have had nothing of an Earthquake in these Parts till last Sunday Evening, when they had it all over the Isle of Wight. My Son wrote me the following Account of it, which is dated at Newport, on Monday the 19th: Read March 29. 1750. `` Last Night, just at 6 o' Clock, as my Aunt `` and I were sitting together, we felt an Earth`` quake, and a terrible one I think. At first we `` heard a small Noise, which we supposed was a `` Chariot; and, as the Noise grew louder, the `` House began to shake; till at last the Noise grew `` so loud, and the House shook so much, that we `` expected it would fall down. I believe it con`` tinued near a Minute; and it was a great Mercy `` we were not all consumed. I confess I was `` dreadfully frighten'd. We had nothing fell down `` from the Shelves in our House; but both our `` Neighbours had Things thrown down from their `` Shelves. I heard a Man say there was another `` Shock this Morning between Three and Four of `` the Clock, but we felt nothing of that. I be`` lieve it was felt all over the Island; for here is `` a Man in Town who felt it at St. Helen's.'' Yesterday [653] <inferred>Yesterday</inferred> I heard they had a little of it at Portsmouth and Lymington: And a Servant-Maid in this Town says, she felt her Chair shake; and the Windows shook, and the Wainscot crack'd, just at the same time: But I neither felt it, nor can find any body besides that did.
