V. A Letter from John Bevis, M. D. to John Machin, Esq; Secret. R. S. &c. containing some Observations concerning Mercury. S I R, THE Observations to which the inclosed Computations are made by Mr. Morriss from somewhat more correct Elements than those in Dr. Halley's Tables, were carefully taken by myself, with an excellent astronomical Sector of five Feet Radius. You will perceive how far I am limited, by my Friend's Request; so must intreat you, if you think it worth while, to inform the Presented May 4. 1744. [49] the Royal Society, that Mercury's Motion has not been at all disturb'd, [by the late Comet] to do it in what manner you shall think best. I am, S I R, Your obedient, Wednesday, May 23. 1744. humble Servant, J. Bevis. 1744, May 17.
