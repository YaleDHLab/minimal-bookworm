An Experiment made at a Meeting of the Royal Society, touching the Diminution of Sound in Air rarefy'd. By Mr Fr. Hauksbee. A Bell being included under a Receiver, which being shaken to make the Clapper strike, it was very observable that the Interposition of the Glass betwixt the Bell and the Ear, was a great obstruction to its Sound, notwithstanding it was audible at some good distance from it: But gradually withdrawing the Air, and making several Stops to shake the Bell at different Degrees of Rarefaction, the Diminution of the Sound at every Stop was very distinguishable. Till at last, when the Receiver was well exhausted of Air, the remains of Sound was then so little, that the best Ears could but just distinguish it: It appearing to them like a small shrill Sound as at a great remoteness. Upon suffering the Air to re enter (which was not done all at once, but by turns) 'twas easie to perceive the increase of Sound at the different times the Bell was made to ring: The Recipient being again repleat with Air, the Sound then seem'd something more clear and audible than it did upon its first inclusion.
