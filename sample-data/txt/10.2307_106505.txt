Salar Spots. Answer to the objections of M. De la Lande, against those spots being excavations in the luminous matter of the sun, together with a short examination of the views entertained by him upon that subject. By Alexander~Wilson, M. D. p. 144. A former volume of Transactions referred to, for the doctor's reasons for concluding that all spots consisting of a dark nucleus and surrounding umbra, are excavations in the luminous matter, p. 145. His conviction thereof have been perfected by eight years subsequent observations, p. 146. Persons less used to examine objects with glasses may require more palpable dimensions of future great spots to behold these phenomena, ibid. The objection that the absence of the umbra on one side, when spots are near the limb, is not constantly answered, p. 147. et seq. Mess. Cassini and De la Hire did not think any thing of moment depended on a new attention to the form of the spots, p. 148. Though some few spots may differ from all the rest, it will not warrant the conclusion that no spot can be an excavation, p. 149. How far spots, which near the middle of the disk appear equal and similar in all things, may yet differ from one another as excavations, &c. considered, ibid. Distinction between the nearest and farthest umbra, p. 150.
