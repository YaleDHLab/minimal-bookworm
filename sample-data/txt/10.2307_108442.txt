[ 393 ] XVIII. Supplementary Observations on the Structure of the BELEMNITE and BELEMNOTEUTHIS. By GIDEON ALGERNON MANTELL, Esq., LL.D., F.R.S., F.L.S., Vice-President of the Geological Society, Sgc. Received November 5, 1849,-Read February 14, 1850. As several eminent naturalists have expressed doubts of the correctness of my interpretation of some of the facts described in the Memoir on the Belemnite and Belemnnoteuthis, published in the Philosophical Transactions, Part II. 1848, I am induced to lay before the Royal Society the following additional observations in confirmation of the opinions advanced in my previous communication on this subject. That distinguished naturalist, Mr. J. E. GRAY, has especially controverted my statement that the phragmocone of the Belemnites of the Oxford Clay* possessed a pair of elongated shelly processes, which extended beyond the peristome or upper border of the conical chambered shell; the aperture resembling in this respect that of cer_ tain species of Ammonitest. In the recently published " Catalogue of the Mollusca in the Collection of the British Museum+ " Mr. GRAY remarks, "'Dr. MANTELL has figured a specimen which appeals to have an elongated process on each side, like the processes on the sides of the mouth of certain Ammonites; but on examining his specimen I am very doubtful if this appearance does not arise trom an accidental fracture of the upper part of the conical shell." Since the publication of my former Memoir, three Belemnites with phragmocones, in which the parts in question are unequivocally manifest, have come under my ob. servation. Two of these interesting fossils are in the Gallery of Organic Remains in the British Museum: the third is in mny possession. In addition to these examples, evidence in proof that this structure is normal, and not the result of accident, has been afforded by numerous detached portions of belemnital phragmocones from the Oxford Clay and Lias, which display well-defined vestiges of the expanded bases of these processes: and that eminent palaeontologist, Mr. JOHN MORRIS of Kensington, informs me that he has recognized their presence in specimens from various strata and localities. In the three examples above mentioned, that part of the process which extends* The species of Belemnite to which my observations refer, Mr. MORRIS informs me is Belemnites Puzosianus of D'ORBIGNY, B. Owenii of Mr. PRATT. t Philosophical Transactions, 1848, Plate XIII. fig. 3. p. 181. 4 Part 1, Cephalopoda Antepedia, p. 124.MDCCCL. 394 DR. MANTELL ON THE BELEMNITE. beyond the upper or basilar margin of the phragmocone is well defined; and in each of these specimens the extension of the longitudinal plates or bands may be distinctly traced downwards, almost to the distal end or apex, as a thin nacreous shelly plate, striated longitudinally, and having obliquely divergent lines on the ventral margin. The finest specimen from Wiltshire in the British Museum (Plate XXVIII. fig. 1), like that discovered by my son*, consists of the osselet or guard (b) partially invested by its capsule, with the phragmocone in natural apposition: the latter is shattered and pressed almost flat, but preserves a conical outline, and has on the upper part the right process (e), which extends 5 inches above the peristome or border of the chambered cone: a portion of the left process is seen atf; c, denotes the lower termination of the process. Fig. 2 represents the upper portion of this fossil of the natural size, and so clearly shows the parts described that further detail is unnecessary. I would particularly direct attention to the evident extension of the base of the process (x, x, x) dowvn the phragmocone as a nacreous band or plate finely striated. Under a slightly magnifying power this expansion appears like a thin shelly integument deposited on the external surface of the chambered cone, and is marked with curved diverging lines on the lateral border. In the former Memoir the number and position of these processes could not be determined with precision; the specimens recently obtained show that there were but two,-one on each side the aperture or peristome, and these were situated nearer to the dorsal than to the ventral aspect. The siphunculus always occupies the median and ventral side of the phragmocone; and its excentric apex is directed towards the same region, in which is also situated the sulcus of the guard (see Plate XXIX. fig. 5). In the fragment of a large uncompressed belemnital phragrmiocone froin Lyme Regis, for the loan of which I am indebted to Mr. MORRIS, the relative position of the parts above described is distinctly exhibited, Plate XXIX.: fig. 3ff, the remains of the lateral processes; g, the siphunculus, occupying the ventral aspect; h, the dorsal line. The outline, Plate XXIX. fig. 4, is intended to express concisely the facts described. With regard to the osselet (the distal solid part of which is generally termed the guard or rostrum), I would remark, that since my former communication I have inspected many hundred specimens firom various localities, and have ascertained that although in detached examples (the ordinary condition in which these fossils occur) the rostrum appears to terminate by a well-defined line at the upper part, yet this is not really the case; for the same radiated structure originally extended upwards and surrounded and protected the phragmocone as a sheath, and gradually became confluent with the investing capsule or periostricum; probably terminating in a horny flexible integument. A fragment of the receptacle taken from the upper part of a specimen, and which is not thicker than stout paper, is delineated under a mag-* Philosophical Transactions, 1848, Plate XV. fig. 3. DR. MANTELL ON THE BELEMNITE. 395 nifying power of eight diameters in Plate XXIX. fig. 6. In this section are clearly seen the outer integument or periostrictum (a), the radiated structure of the osselet (b), and the shell of the phragmocone (c). Among the numerous Belemnites I have examined, not the slightest trace of an ink-bag, or its contents, the sepia, could be detected. BELEMNOTEUTHIS.-Some uncompressed examples of the distal end of the phragmocones of this Cephalopod have lately been discovered, which must dispel any remaining doubts as to the generic distinction, first established by the late Mr. CHANNING PEARCE in 1842, being based on natural characters. The specimen figured, Plate XXIX. fig. 7, appeals to me to afford conclusive evidence on the points in dispute. By a reference to my former paper, it will be seen that the longitudinal ridges, which are always present on the distal end of the phraginocone of the Belemnoteuthis, are regarded by those observers who contend that the latter belong to Belemnites, as plaits, or folds, originating from fracture and lateral compression. In the fossil before us these ridges are entire and well-defined; two are situated on the ventral and one on the dorsal region. Fig. 7 is a transverse section, enlarged four diameters, in which are shown the form of the ridges and the radiated structure of the solid part of the phragmocone: I scarcely need observe, that in the true Belemnite the cone is chambered to the extreme apex. These characters will remind the paleontologist of the very analogous organization of the Beloptera of the tertiary strata, alluded to in my former memoir*. In fact it is now proved that the Belemnoteuthis (as was originally suggested by Mr. CHANNING PEARCE and Mr. CUNNINGTON) possessed an osselet of a radiated structure containing a chambered siphunculatedc cone, but without an extended rostrum or guard; thus forming an interesting transition to the Belemnite, from which it is generically distinctt. From the facts before us, our knowledge of the organization of the genus Belemnites comprises the following structures:1. The investing periostricum or capsule, which enveloped the osselet, and extending upwards, constituted the external parietes of the receptacle. 2. The Osselet, characterized by its radiated structure, composed of trihedral prismatic fibres, which terminated distally in a solid rostrum having an alveolus or conical hollow to receive the lower portion of the chambered phragniocone, and proximally in a thin cup-like expansion, which became confluent with the capsule, and formed the receptacle for the viscera. 3. The Phragmocone, or conical siphunculated chambered internal shell, the apex of which occupied the alveolus of the rostrum, and the upper part expanded into a capacious chamber, from the basilar margin of which proceeded two elongated testaceous processes.* Philosophical Transactions, 1848, p. 176. t The Conoteuthis Dupinianus of M. D'ORBIGNY, from the Upper Neocomian strata of the Department d'Aube, appears, so far as can be determined by mere description, to approach very closely to the Belemnoteuthis. It is stated to have a long slender osselet, terminated by a chambered cone, but without a guard or rostrum.3 E 2 396 DR. MANTELL ON THE BELEMNITE. Some of the specimens in the British Museum and in my own cabinet exhibit on the space around and between the processes, delicate striae, apparently produced by the imprint of the muscular fibres of the mantle or other tissues; and these I believe are the only indications hitherto observed of the soft parts of the animal to which the Belemnite belonged. In fine, the Belemnite is characterized by its rostrum and the investing capsule, and its phragmocone chambered to the extreme apex and having a pair of testaceous processes at the basilar margin of the peristome*; while the Belemnoteuthis has simply an osselet of a radiated fibrous structure, inclosing a conical chambered shell that terminates distally in a solid obtuse point+. Whether the Belemnite resembled the Belemnoteuthis in possessing an ink-bag, and having a body with eight uncinated arms and a pair of long tentacula, future discoveries can alone determine. Although this communication may be devoid of interest to those who do not especially cultivate the department of natural science to which this inquiry belongs, it will not I trust be deemed unimportant by the paleontologist, since the new facts herein described tend to remove in some degree the obscurity which veils the original structure of a race of highly organized beings, that swarmed in the seas of every part of the globe+ during the secondary geological periods, from the Lias to the Chalk inclusive, and which appears to have become extinct with the contemporary Cephalopoda, the Ammonites, at the close of the cretaceous epoch?. Chester Square, Oct. 1849. Additional Note. February 14, 1850. Since the previous observations were communicated to the Secretary of the Royal Society, I have been so fortunate as to obtain fiomn the Oxford Clay of Wiltshire, a Belemnite in which the two dorsal processes of the'phragmocone are more perfectly displayed than in any specimen hitherto discovered (see Plate XXX.). From the rarity of such fossils, and their extreme fragility and perishable nature,* I do not mean to aver that similar processes exist in every species of Belemnite, for it is probable that, as in Ammonites, there may have been considerable diversity in the form and size of these appendages; and in some species the basilar margin of the peristome may have been destitute of them: my remarks exclusively refer to the'species of Belemnites described in the text. t The facts described in 'the text are of course directly opposed to the views expressed in the following extract from the Philosophical Transactions for 1844, p. 74: " The association of the spathose guards with crushed phragmocones identical in structure with .those in connection with the fossil ink-bags and muscular parts." + Belemnites have recently been discovered in limestone in the Middle Island of New Zealand, by my eldest son, Mr. WALTER MANTELL.-See Geoloo'ical Journal for August, 1850. ? Belemnites first appear in the Lias, where they suddenly attain their maximum development. Many species abound in the Oolitic or Jurassic formation: in the Greensand they are likewise abundant; in the Galt there are but two or three small species. In the Chalk strata a modification of the type, termed Belemnitellwe, appear, and with these the race seems to have become extinct; at least no traces of its existence have been detected in any newer deposits, save the Beloptera of the tertiary previously mentioned. I am not aware that any examples of Belemnoteuthis have been found in the Lias: hitherto I have obtained specimens only from the Oxford Clay and contiguous strata. 77 ~7*.-..5 A7 J;f2 I)D7sal deml p>zrne of de JA'ylasvaunis 1~a tl\a S;'3e 1 , J DZ'-kgb d,,Z ee aMS ig ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~~' ' w'W~ ),~\V e~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~iNJ Th~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~TI t~tirx90X*/t A>Xa at that A/r4Mtwsvgoottv o/e RkB.itSh ->~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~A, M.~7.'z+b~,Xfs~n P/il)l.

MANTELL ON THE BELEMNITE. 397 it is important to preserve faithful representations taken whilst the specimens are fresh from, the stratum, for when the clay contracts by drying, the delicate shelly structure of the phragmocone but too frequently shrivels and flakes off; I know of no means by which this decomposition can be prevented, and am therefore desirous of adding to the illustrations of this communication the accompanying drawing, by Mr. MoUNsEY, of the beautiful fossil above mentioned, in which are shown the elongated processes of the phragmocone in their natural position on each side the dorsal line; the interval between them is occupied by a thin pellicle of a dark integument marked with very fine diverging parallel strive; this substance is probably the inner lining of the capsule of the sepiostaire in a carbonized state, a condition in which animal tissues so often occur in argillaceous deposits. I likewise annex a drawing of another specimen (Plate XXIX. figs. 9, 10) of the distal termination of the osselet of the Belemnoteuthis, in which the alveolus or hollow occupied by the chambered shelly cone is exposed; the cavity is filled with calcareous spar, and is surrounded by a dense fibrous radiated structure, analogous to that of the osselet of the true Beletnnite; an additional proof that in the Belem-noteuthis this investment is the osselet or guard of the phragmocone. After this evidence, the presumed generic identity of the Belemnite and Belemnoteuthis must, I conceive, be abandoned by every accurate observer; consequently the form and structure of the body and arms, and other soft parts of the Cephalopoda to which the Belemnnites belonged, have yet to be discovered.
