Note WHat in No. 54. p. 1077. in the Answ, to Qu. 1. is said of the Observation of Briners, is to be understood, that the Workmen think so, that they make more Salt with the same quantity of brine, at the Ful Moon, then at other times, though really they do not, as the Answerer Judgeth by his Observ. in No. 53. p. 1064: Who hath since advertis'd, that 'tis possible at times, when the Pit hath been much drawn first, that then, if without intermission they go on walling till the Full, they may make at that time more Salt, than at another time, it being well known, that much drawing the Pit, strengthens the Brine.
