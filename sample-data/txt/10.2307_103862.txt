Part of a Letter from Dr. Richardson, F. R. S. to Sir Hans Sloane, Bart. President of the Royal Society, and Colleg. Physic. concerning the Squilla aquae dulcis. I Have met with very little of late in Natural History worth mentioning to you. One Thing I cannot omit, which I do not remember is taken notice of by any Naturalist; that is, the great Destruction that is made amongst the small Fry of Fish by the Squilla aquae dulcis, which abound in most X x 2 standing (332) standing Waters. In a small breeding Pond nigh my House, where I had formerly plenty of small Carp and Tench every Year, and of late scarce any young Breed to be met with, my Gardener not long ago observed one of the Squillae, with a Carp in its Mouth almost as large as itself; and has since observed these Insects hunting amongst the Weeds, and vigorously pursuing the small Fry. I order'd the Gardener to catch some of these Insects, and bring them home alive, with some of the smallest Fish he could meet with. We put them together in a large Bason of Water. The Insects were so rapacious, that they fell upon the Fish immediately, and destroy'd several in my Sight; and before Morning had devoured all that were in the Bason. North-Bierley, Sept. 5, 1733.
