LXXII. O o The 282 Mr. BARKER'S Register of The ground was unusually dry the first half of January, and want of water in some places. Inclined to frost, but not fixed; one for a week was followed toward the end of the month by a smarter but shorter with a good deal of snow, and went away with rain and floods; then showery, and in February often stormy. The month of March was drier, generally fine, a good seed-time, and the middle of the month warm and growing; but cold N.E. winds at the end. Soon after April came in, the weather was fine and growing, sometimes showery, and the middle being very warm brought on things very much; but the end of the month, and beginning of May, cold N.E. winds, yet sometimes hot sun. About the middle of May was showery and growing; but the end of it, and beginning of June, hot, dry, clear, and burning June 3d, began showers and often thunder, which being several times repeated for a fortnight, and hot weather with it, made plenty of grass in this country and some others; but where the rains were smaller, as they were about London, in Sussex, and other places, it only freshened the ground without growing much. The beginning of hay-time was very fine, a wet week in the middle did not greatly hurt the hay, and was very good for the turnips, then newly sown. The latter half of July, and almost all August, were very dry, hot, and burning; the harvest almost all very well got, except some of the pease, which were either not got in, or the hovels not thatched, when the great rain came September 2. There was a great crop of wheat, but in some places it was mildewed; the barley was universally good; the pease uncertain. The general prices were, wheat thirty-eight shillings, barley sixteen or seventeen shillings, oats eleven or twelve shillings, pease and beans about twenty-two or twentythree shillings a quarter. 5 The the Weather at Lyndon. 283 The ground was now exceedingly burnt, and great want of water; but in the first half of September there came so much rain, the ground already warm, and hot weather with it, that in a fortnight's time there was plenty of grass. The autumn was in general fine and pleasant, and the latter end of September and all October scarce any rain, so that at the end of the month the grass in some places plainly began to burn, which was remarkable so late in the year, and after its being so fruitful in September; and notwithstanding some showery weather in the former part of November, the roads were rather dusty the beginning of December; then dark, misty, raw, cold east winds, but milder again and showery till the end of the year. It has been an uncommonly open season, there have been some frosty mornings, and one day or two it scarce went away in the shade; but there has not been one thorough frosty day yet, and there has been thunder at Christmas.
