Aseries of observations of the satellites of the Georgian planet, including a passage through the node of their orbits; with an introductory account of the telescopic apparatus that has been used on this occasion, and afinal exposilionl of some catlcuated particulars deducedfrom the observations. By William Herschel, LL.D. F. R. S. Read June 8, 1815. THWE observations of the satellites of the Georgian planet, of which an account is given in thispaper, are of such a nature that, in order to judge of them properly, and to make them useful to those who would continue them, it will be necessary to enter into some particulars relating to the telescopic powers required for critically viewing such difficult objects. The great distance of the Georgian planet renders an attempt to investigate the movements of its satellites a very arduous undertaking; for their light, having to traverse a space of such vast extent before it can reach us, is so enfee. bled, and their apparent diameter so diminished, that an instrument, to be prepared for viewing them, must be armed with the double power of magnifying and of penetrating into space. With regard to the first of these requisites, I have already shown in a former Paper,* that the magnifying power of my ten feet telescope, when no uncommon degree of light is* Phil. Trans. for a 8o5, page 3 I. 2944 Dr. HERSCHEL!Ps observations of the satellites wanting, is fully equal to what mnay be required to view extremely small objects; but this branch of the properties of optical instruments seems not to. be generally understood: the question how much a telescope magnifies, admits of various answers. To resolve it properly, we ought in all circumstances to consider how far the magnifying power of a telescope is supported by an adequate quantity of light; as without it, even the highest power and distinctness cannot be efficient. The question therefore ought to be limited to an inquiry into the extent of what may be called the effective magnifying power? It will however be found, that even then, the quantity of this power cannot be positively assigned. For if a card containing engraved letters of a certain size be put up at a given distance, the effective power of a telescope directed to it, will be that wherewith we can read these letters with the greatest facility; but if either the size of the letters, or their distance from the telescope, be changed, the quantity of this power will no longer remain the same. An obvious consequence of this consideration is, that the effective power of telescopes has a considerable range of extent, and can only be assigned when the object to be viewed is given; and that in this determination two circumstances are concerned, which require a separate investigation; and this is abundantly confirmed when a ten feet reflector, such as has been mentioned, is directed to the Georgian planet; for with none of its highest powers can we possibly ascertain even the existence of the satellites. Since, then, it is absolutely necessary that the power of magnifying should be accompanied, with a sufficient quantity of light, to reach the satellites of this remote planet, it may of the Georgian planet. 295 be useful to cast an eye ution1 the action of a power which is become so essential. Its advantages and its inconveniences must equally be objects of consideration. A very material inconvenience is that mirrors, which must be large in order to grasp much light, must also be of a great focal length; and that in consequence of this, we must sub'mit to be incumbered with a large apparatus, which will require an assistant at the clock and writing desk, and also an additional person to work the necessary movements. The machinery of my twenty feet telescope is however so complete, that I have been able to take up the planet at an early hour in the evening, and to continue the observations of its own motion, together with that of its satellites, for seven, eight, or nine hours successively. The forty feet telescope having more light than the twenty feet, it ought to be explained why I have not always used it in these observations. Of two reasons that may be assigned, the first relates to the apparatus and the nature of the instrument. The preparations for observing with it take up much time, which in fine astronomical nights is too precious to be wasted in mechanical arrangements. The temperature of the air for observations that must not be interrupted, is often too changeable to use an instrument that will not easily accommodate itself to the change: and since this telescope, besides the assistant at the clock and writing :desk, requires moreover the attendance of two workmen to execute the necessary movements, it cannot be convenient to have every thing prepared for occasional lucid intervals between flying clouds -that may chance to occur; whereas in less than ten 296 Dr. HERSCHEL'S observations of the satellites minutes, the twenty feet telescope may be properly adjusted and directed so as to have the planet in the field of view. In the next place I have to mention, that it has constantly been a rule with me, not to observe with a larger instrument, when a smaller would answer the intended purpose. To use a manageable apparatus saves not only time and trouble, but what is of greater consequence, a smaller instrument may comparatively be carried to a more perfect degree of action than a larger one.: because a mirror of less weight and dial meter may be composed of a metal which will reflect more light than that of a larger one; it will also accommodate itself sooner to a change of temperature; and when it con. tracts tarnish, it may with less trouble be repolished; to which may be added, that having two mirrors for the twenty feet always ready, my observations could never be interrupted by accidents which often happen to large mirrors, such as greatly injure, or even destroy their polish. The quantity of light reflected by the mirror of a twenty feet telescope of my construction being known, and the satellites of the Georgian planet being the objects to be viewed, I may now examine the combined powers of this instrument, and assign the limits to which they may be stretched. It will however be proper first, to point out from experience some of the advantages that may be taken, if not to increase, at least not to obstruct, the penetrating power, by the full effect of which the magnifying power is to be supported. The first precaution I ought to give is, that in these deli' cate observations, no double eye glass should be used, as it cannot be prudent to permit the waste of light at four surfaces, of the Georgian planet. 297 when two will collect the rays to their proper focus. The hole through which they pass in coming to the eye, should be much larger than the diameter of the optic pencils, and considerably nearer the glass than their focus; for the eye ought on no account to come into contact with the eye piece; and a little practice will soon enable the observer to keep his eye in the required situation. It is hardly necessary to add, that no hand should touch the eye piece. With regard to the eye glasses, when merely the object of saving light is considered, I can say from experience, that concaves have greatly the advantage of convexes; and that they give also a much more distinct image than convex glasses. This fact-I established by repeated experiments about the year 1776, with a set of concave eye glasses I had prepared for the purpose, and which are still in my possession. The glasses, both double and plano-concaves, were alternately tried with convex lenses of an equal focus, and the result, for brightness and distinctness, was decidedly in favour of the concaves. For the cause of the superior brightness and sharpness of the image which is given by these glasses, we must probably look to the circumstance of their not permitting the reflected rays to come to a focus. Perhaps a certain mechanical effect, considerably injurious to clearness and distinctness, takes place at the focal crossing of the rays, which is admitted in convex lenses.* ' About the same time that the experiments on concave eye glasses were made, I tried also to investigate the cause of the inferiority of the convex ones; and it occurred to me, that an experiment might be made to ascertain whether the rays of light il MDCCCXVO Q q 298 Dr. HERSCHEL'S observations of the satellites I have occasionally availed myself of the light of concave eye glasses, but a great objection against their constant use is, that none of the customary micrometers can be applied to them, since they do not permit the rays to form a focal image. Their very small field of view is also a considerable imperfection; in observations, however, that do not require a very extensive field; such as double stars or the satellites of Saturn and the Georgian planet, this inconvenience is not so material.* As I have already shown that the effective power of a telescope arises from the combination of its magnifying and space penetrating powers; and have also proved that the effect of their union, when they are differently combined, must have a considerable range, it will now be easy to point out the extent of this range in the telescope by which the following observations have been made. The magnifying power by which the satellites of the planet were discovered was only 157; but this power, which has beencrossing, jostled against each other, or were turned aside from their right lined course by inflections or deflections. With a view to this, I directed a io feet telescope to some finely engraved letters put up at a convenient distance. A convex eye glass was fixed to a skeleton apparatus, which left the focal point freely exposed. A concave mirror was placed so as to throw the focus of the sun's rays upon the focal image of the telescope, where, meeting with no intercepting body, they would freely pass through it at right angles. Then a screen being placed to keep off the solar rays, I fixed my attention upon the letters viewed in the telescope, and the screen being alternately withdrawn and replaced, I could perceive no sensible alteration in the brightness or distinctness of the letters. Hence I surmised, that the rays of light did not sensibly jostle in an instantaneous right angled passage, but that possibly they might suffer inflections or deflections in their crossing at the focal point on acconu.it of their being longer in collateral proximity. * See Phil. Trans. for 179 pP. 8. of the Georgian planet. 299 constantly used in my sweeps of the heavens, and was found to be very effective for the discovery of faint nebulae and minute clusters of stars, is hardly sufficient to show the satellites steadily; for, unless every thing is favourable, their faint scintillation will only be perceived by interrupted glimpses. The magnifiers 'R00, 460, 6oo and 8oo, it will appear by the following observations, have gradually been found to be more effective on the objects on which they were used; act cording to the clearness of the air, the altitude of the planet, the absence of the moon, the high polish of the mirror, and other circumstances: on particular occasions, when doubtful points were to be resolved, even 12oo has been most effective. The higher magnifiers 24,0O, 3600 and 72oo have also been used to scrutinize the closest neighbourhood of the planet, in order to discover additional satellites: but, from the appearance of the known ones, which began to be nebulous, I concluded that these powers were not distinct enough to be used on this occasion. As the following observations are given for the purpose of enabling astronomers to calculate the elements of the orbits and motions of the satellites with mathematical precision, I have endeavoured to save them some labour by giving a clear statement of the general outlines of them; and that some judgment may be formed of their accuracy, which I hope will be found considerable, a short detail of the method I have pursued will be necessary. For ascertaining the position of the satellites from which their periodical revolutions were determined, three different methods have been used. Coarse estimations were made when they seemed to be Q q 2 Soo Dr. HERSCHEL'S observations of the satellites sufficient to keep the satellites in view, by way of ascertaining their identity; for unless they were followed in their course and known to be satellites, it would have been endless to measure either the distance or position of every small star that might have the appearance of one; and as the opportunities for taking measures, which require a very clear and undisturbed atmosphere, were scarce, and often interrupted by cloudy or moonlight nights, the identity of the satellites would have been doubtful if their position had not been attended to, when seen in unfavourable circumstances. When no other stars interfered, it was often sufficient barely to mention the quadrant in which they were seen, by recording that such a satellite was np, nf, sf, or sp; or if necessary, some rather more determined account, such as 40 or 5o degrees tnp, sf, &c. As a check upon the description of the situations, a figure was always added to represent the planet, its satellites and the neighbouring stars as they appeared in the telescope. Very often indeed the configuration itself was deemed to be sufficient to point out the situation of the satellites, which by way of distinction were marked by numbered points; X and X being used to distinguish the known satellites; S, 4, 5, &c. those that might possibly be other suspected, but not ascers tained ones. Stars instead of points, were marked by aster risks. More careful estimations were made with a power not less than 3oo, and a wire in the focus of the eye glass, to ascertain the parallel; they are capable of considerable accuracy in situations that are only a few degrees north or south preceding or following, and also when the position of a satellite Js nearly 9o degrees north or south of the planet. of the Georgian planet. So0 Measures taken with the micrometer may always be supposed to be accurate, unless they are marked as being affected by some circumstances existing at the time they were taken: when these are favourable, they can hardly be liable to any great error. The calculations which I have given with the observations, will show the appropriate confidence each of these three methods of obtaining the positions of the satellites may separately deserve. A much greater difficulty attaches to taking measures of distances than to those of angular positions: when the latter are taken, we have the position of the satellite in view all the time the planet passes along the parallel; and, although the moment of ascertaining the angle is only that in which the planet is in the centre of the wires, yet a constant attention to the motion of the two bodies will sufficiently enable us to perceive any excess or defect in the parallelism between their situation and that of the adjustable wire, whereas in measures of distances, the telescope must be kept in motion to retain the two bodies in their contact with the two wires, which disturbance considerably afflcts the delicacy of vision, and moreover requires a divided attention, as the passage of each body over its respective wire must be viewed. The only exception is, when the satellite is at 90 degrees, in which case the distance of the two bodies mnay indeed be measured with great accuracy. The lucid point micrometer which has been tried is subject to the same difficulties ;* its application to mny construction of the so feet telescope, with regard to situation, is very conve-For a description of this micrometer, see Phil. Trans. for 1782, page ,63. 309, D .Dr. HERSCHEL'S observations of the satellites nient. When the apparatus was preparing, I found that handles, 2o feet long, would be very cumbersome, and, ate tempted to try the micrometer with the assistance of. Anderson to arrange the points; but, when engaged in the firet measure, I found that unless I had myself the command of the motions, a perfect adjustment could not be obtained; or would at least take up so much time as would bring on an alteration in the telescopic motions, not consistent with perfect vision. This micrometer has, however, the peculiar advantage that it may be used with a concave eye glass. When a satellite is either directly preceding or following the planet, its distance may be measured by the difliercnce of the time of their passing the meridional wire. This method, which has also been tried, is however not sufficiently delicate for very small intervals, and is moreover of little use, on account of the very limited situations. The following observations on the satellites of the Georgian planet are given in the order of time they were made. They contain every thing that relates to the appearance and motion not only of the two principal large satellites, that are plainly within the reach of a 20 feet telescope of my construction, but also the more difficult researches that have been pursued for detecting additional satellites. That such there are I can have no doubt; but to determine their number and situation will probably require an increase of the illuminating power, such as I was in hopes, when I published my announce of their existence, would have been used by other astronomers, in pursuit of the subject pointed out to them; a 25 feet reflector which is mentioned in the observations, may probably be sufficient for the purpose. of the Georgian planet. 303 To facilitate calculation, the observations are all given in mean time, and after each of them is added a theoretical ex. position of the place of the satellites, which I have called an identification, and is denoted by the sign T; the great use of which will be to point out the validity of each observation, by comparing the observed places with the theoretical ones. The method of identification, which will be described hereafter, by giving not only the angle of position at which a satellite ought to have been seen, but also its proportional distance in 6oo dth part of the radius of its orbit, is of great consequence when the orbits of the satellites are much contracted. These distances indeed become at last the only criterion by which we may know the satellites, for the angle of position, when the planet is near the node of the orbits, admits of so little change that it ceases to be a direction for identifying them. The same distance will also give us the total value of the measure of any distances taken by the micrometer, so far at least as to show which of them may be the most proper to be chosen for a more rigorous investigation. An identification of supposed satellites cannot be made by calculation; but the observations of following and also of preceding nights, accompanied by accurate configurations, may ascertain whether the object in question be of a sidereal or planetary nature. For if by the removal of the planet a supposed satellite be left in its former place, it is decidedly a star; whereas a well ascertained absence from the observed place will make its planetary nature highly probable. Then also, if a configuration and description of every small star, that is situated in, and. very near the path of the planet, has been previously made, and additional stars are afterwards 3o4 Dr HERSCHEL'S observations of the satellites found to be near the planet, which cannot be accounted for, it becomes again probable that such questionable objects are of a planetary nature, And this being a kind of identification, I have added it after the calculated one, to every observation of doubtful objects, except where a supposed satellite is pointed out which there is reason to believe may be a real one; for in that case, the observations relating to the object in questions are given in their regular order. It will not be necessary to give the configurations that were made at the time of observation; they generally contained the planet, its satellites, and some of the neighbouring stars, especially those that were in the path of the planet's motion; nor will it be necessary to mention lines and descriptions of situations of stars pointed out by letters affixed to them, as the observations are generally so redundant, that I found it highly necessary to compress them. Observations of the satellites of the Georgian planet, accompanied by a theoretical determination of their situation, whereby their identity may be ascertained. i787, January lid 12h i3m. There is a supposed first satellite about 42 or 43 degrees south following the planet; and a second about 4, degrees north preceding. A third supposed satellite is south following the planet. a. By the identifying method it appears that a real satellite, called the first, was visible at the time mentioned about 45j degrees south following; whiclh agrees with the estimation of the angle of its situation, and also wvith a configuration of the stars and planet, drawn at the time of observation. By Of the Georgt'an pla set. 3 the same method it appears that a real satellite called the second was visible about 65 degrees north preceding the planet; which situation agrees with the configuration and also sufficiently well with a coarse estimation, which, as there was -no wire for the parallel in the focus of the eye glass, could not be accurate. The supposed third satellite, by subsequent observations, was found to be a star. 1787, January i .' The first and second satellites are not to be seen in the place where I saw them last night. The supposed third is left where it was. I can see no small star near the planet, but the evening is not sufficiently clear, 1787, January 14, S. Gi' There are again three supposed satellites; I have marked them 1st, 2d, and 3d, without any particular reason for that order. 4 The first satellite was 88? nf; which agrees with the situation of that which in the configuration was marked 1st. The second satellite was 229 sp, and agrees with that which in the configuration was marked 3d. In the configuration the numbers are placed according to their distances from the planet, and that which is marked 2d was found to be a star remaining in its place. 1787, January 17, vi" s1' There are now again three supposed satellites. The first is south preceding the planet, and, makes a right angle with the 2d and 8d. The second is. at the angular point and is south of the planet but a little preceding. The 8d is north following the planet. I have also added a 4th and sth. The night is very fine and my telescope bears a high power. t The first was 3g sp, which agrees with the configurations. The second was south of the planet but a littlefollowing, MDcCcxv. Rr 306 Dr. HERSCHEL'N observations of the satellites namely SoA ? sf; which agrees sufficiently well with an estimation made without a direction for the parallel. The sup.posed 3d, 4th, and 5th, by next night's observation, remained in their places as small stars. 1787, January i8, IP 45'. There are two supposed satellites; the first is directly south of the planet; the second is about 45 degrees south following, and a little farther from the planet than the first. With 480 the first is about 4 diameters of the planet distant from it; the second is about 4-j or 5 diameters from the planet ; the first is from the second about 21 diameters of the planet. There is no small star in the path of the planet that might be taken for a satellite to morrow. + The first was 762 sf. The second was 59-1 sf; both these positions agree sufficiently well with the delineated configuration. 1787, January 24, 1 1h Aid. The first and second satellites of January 18, are no longer in the place in which they were that night. There are two satellites; the first is about 45" np the planet; the second is about 80? np; it is brighter than the first. I had a glimpse of a 3d and 4th. + The first satellite was 490 up; the second was 75+ up, which agrees well with the estimations and with the configuration. The observations of the third and fourth were lost, the planet not being seen again till eight days after, when it would have taken up too much time to look for them. 1787, February 4, 6h it'. The first satellite is about 8o0 sp; the second is about 3o0 nf. There is too much day-light to see the satellites well. A third supposed satellite is south preceding-the first; it is extremely small. There is but one of the Georgian planet. 307 single small star in the path of the planet which to morrow night may be taken for a satellite. + The first satellite was 5oQ sp; the second was 40V nf. This differs considerably from the estimations, probably owing to the remaining day-light the satellites however could not be mistaken, as there were no other stars near the planet. 1787, February >, gh 3'. Both satellites are certainly absent from the place where I saw them last night. The first is about 85' sf; the second satellite (miscalled a small star) is by the configuration at a great angle nf. The small star in the path of the planet observed last night remains in its place. f The first satellite was 89? sf; the second was 6w" nf. 1787, February 6. I compared the configurations of January i a, 14, 17, 18, 24, February 4 and 5 together, and found that, admitting one of the satellites to make a revolution round the planet in about 8-j days, and supposing its orbit to be very open to the visual ray, there was always one that would answer to a projection made on that scale. 1 787, February 7, 6h 54'. A satellite (miscalled the third) is a few degrees south following 6h so3, another (miscalled the first) is about 650 np. A small star (miscalled the second satellite) is about 60o sp. a The first satellite was i Ad sf. The second was 683 np. Two days after, the miscalled second, was seen remaining in its observed place. In the course of about nine hours of observation, I saw the planet accompanied by its two satellites, very evidently moving together in the path of the planet. 1787, February 9, 1ih 39'. Both satellites are gone from the place where I saw them the 7th of February. The first R r 2 3o8 Dr. HERSCHEL'S observations of the satellites satellite ( miscalled the second) is directly north of the pla net; the second (miscalled the first) is a few degrees np. t The first was 81 2' nf ; the second i1 np. 1787, February 1o, 8h 57'. The first satellite is about ? np. 8h '33, The second satellite is about 20o Sp; a supposed third is about 450 sf. In a little more than four hours, I saw the satellites go on with the planet, and also in their orbits. t The first satellite was 67I.j np; the second was 26o Sp. The supposed third was lost, no subsequent observation having been made of it. Before I began observing, I had delineated their places on paper, on a supposition that one of them moved at the rate of 8-, the other at that of 131 days the revolution. 1787, February ii, i3h 28'. Between flying clouds I saw the second satellite. The satellite was 571 0 sp, which agrees with the configuration. 1787, February 13, oh o'. The first satellite, with 300, is about 75 or 8o0 sp; its distance from the planet is about 3 of a minute. The second is about 835 sf; its distance is one full minute; the estimations are by the field of view of the sweeping piece. Third, fourth, and fifth supposed satellites were marked. a The first satellite was 68-? sp; its distance was 53, the radius of its orbit being 6cc. The second was 8o ? sf; its distance was 599, the radius of its orbit being also 600. The third, fourth, and fifth supposed satellites proved to be stars. No great accuracy can be expected from the estimated distances given in the observation, the field of the eve piece, which took in 1 A minutes, being much too large for the purpose. of the Geoigian planet. o309 i787, February 16,9h "38'. The two satellites are in the places where I had drawn them on paper. With a power of 3oo, and a wire for the parallel 'in the focus of the eye glass, the first satellite is, by very accurate estimation, about 5 de. grees north following; at the same time, and with the same power and accuracy, the second is about 3 degrees south following. A third supposed satellite is pointed out. a The position being so near the parallel, and by calculation also near the conjugate axis of the elliptical projection of the orbits, and therefore less liable to an error arising from the application of correction, have been fixed upon as standards for the calculation of the periodical revolutions of the satellites. The supposed third was next evening observed to remain in its place. 1787, February 17, 7h 58'. I tried to measure the distance -of the second satellite from the planet by a lamp micrometer. The lucid points were 246,4 inches from the eye, and when they were 144 inches from each other, I found that the adjustment of the distance, and angle of position could not be made to my satisfaction by an assistant, and gave up the measure. The magnifying power being Ib7, the opening of the points gives the angular distance I' 17"; bat the measure when given up was still much too large. t The satellite was 2&8 0 nf, and the distance 505. :1i787, February 19, 7h h,. Having delineated the situation of the satellites on paper, I found them in the expected situation. A third and fourth were added in the configuration. The first satellite wvas 58' np ; the second was 82z nlf. 'The supposed third and fourth proved to be stars. 1 787, February 22, 7h 1tg. By the configuration the first SIO Dr. HERSCHEL'S observations of the satellites satellite is at a considerable ange sp; the second is at a moderate angle np. Third, fourth, and fifth satellites were noticed. f The first was 760 sp; the second was 3i? np. A long interval happening to prevent subsequent observations, the supposed satellites were lost. 1787, March 5, 7 ii4'. The first satellite is about 60 sf 711 17', the second is about 87? nf a third is about 40 nf. f The first satellite was 20o 0 sf; the second was 870 np the third proved to be a star. The planet was only observed about 3 or 4', and it does not appear that great accuracy in the estimations was attempted. 1787, March 7, 7' is'. The first satellite is 820 np. 7h 13d the second is about 3o0 np. Very coarsely estimated. A third is about 60 nf; it seems to have a fourth close to it. Having some doubts about the fourth, I viewed it with 6oo and 80o; I saw it also well with 1200, and had a glimpse of it with 2400. These high magnifiers require a fine apparatus for adjusting the focus. It The first satellite was 780 nf; the second was 41t np; the third and fourth proved to be stars. 1787, March 8, 8h 52'. Both satellites were seen for a few minutes. 4 The first was 7o0 np; the second was 9-LO np. 1787, March ia. I found that some friends who came to view the satellites saw them best with 480, when the planet was drawn to the margin just out of the field. 1787, March Ad, 8h 7' The first satellite is about 480 nf; the second isS ? sf. The second satellite being so nearly following the planet, I tried to measure its distance by sidereal of the Georgian planet. 3S1 time. Of eight transits, four gave 3t"; three gave 3",S5; and one gave 4"; a mean of them is 3",31 ; and the declination of the planet being 21 B57 north, we have the apparent distance 4,5"'99; but I do not trust much to measures by time, in the manner these were taken without a system of wires in the focus of the eye glass, and with the clock and assistant at a considerable distance. . The first satellite was 460 nf ; the second was 24. Sf, and its distance from the planet was 481 ; this would give the greatest elongation 57 0,36 which is probably much too large. i787, March i8, 8h 3'. The satellites are in the place where I expected them. The first is 5 or 60 np; the second is about 750 nf ; it seems to be farther from the planet than when it was near the parallel. I attempted to measure its distance by the parallel wire micrometer; eclipsing the satellite with one wire, and bisecting the planet with the other. The measure gave the distance 46",46. + The first was a1np; the second was 83. ? nf ; and its distance was ,88; which gives the greatest elongation 47"41. 1787, March 19. Both the satellites are in their expected situation, which for the first is 360 sp; for the second 790 np. At 7h 48' I took a good measure of the distance of the second satellite; it gave 44j',24. I attempted a second measure, but was interrupted before I had quite finished it to my liking ; it gave 45",98. t The first satellite was 293 ? sp; the second was 7440 np. and-its distance 596. The expected situations, though calculated from imperfect tables, were sufficient to show that the satellites were not mistaken. 1787, March 20, 7h +4'. I took three measures of the Dr. HERSCHEL'S. observations of the satellites distance of the second satellite; the first gave 40", the second, with the remark, pretty full measure, gave 41",89; the third with the addition not too large, gave 4O",20. + The satellite wa 53 9? np, and the distance 564. 1787, April 9, ioh 22'. I took two very accurate measures of the distance of the second satellite from the planet; the first gave 41",54, the second 44",35. By temporary tables its expected place was 570 sf. "'The satellite was 54' sf; and its distance 6,63. 1787, April ix, ih iS'. By temporary tables the expected situation-of the second satellite was 40 sf. I took three good measures of its distance from the planet; the first gave 84",47 the second $"32; the third' 35",74.

I viewed the Georgian planet with the 40 feet telescope, power 400. The disk of it is very bright. Several small stars are near it, but without a series of observations, it cannot be possible to ascertain which of them are satellites. -What I suppose to be the second is 650 or 7c0 nf. T The first was 87*0 np ; distance 594, . The second was + 760 np ; distance 588. Both satellites were therefore visible, but being among surrounding stars, could not be distinguished from them. Investigation of several particulars deduced from the foregoing observations, with an exposition of the method by which they have been obtained. The first use to be made of the numerous angles of position thathavebeen taken, must be aninvestigation of the place of the node, and the inclination of the orbits of the satellites. When these two particulars are obtained, the times of the periodical 341 Dr. HERSCHEL'S observations of the satellites revolutions of the satellites about the planet, may be settled. It will then be necessary to calculate the places of the satellites for the times in which they were observed, in order to identify them; for, notwithstanding all possible care was taken to keep them in view, yet after the long unavoidable annual interruptions, and the periodical interference of the moon, it will be seen, that several mistakes have been made in naming the satellites, which by that means may be easily corrected. The place of the ascending node, the inclination of the orbits, and the retrograde motions of the satellites determined. When the observations of the satellites in the year IL97, and the beginning of 1798, are examined, it will be found that the first satellite could seldom be seen, and that its positions, when observed were always at a great angle from the parallel; the second was also frequently invisible; and its observed positions were likewise at great angles. From these appearances it may be concluded that the planet was approaching to the node of the satellite's orbits, At the latter end of February, and the beginning of March 1 798, the posit tion of both the satellites approached to a settled angle, which at -last, for two successive days, namely the iith and 12th of March, remained stationary; I have therefore supposed that the planet was then in its passage through the node, and have in my calculations admitted its place to be five signs, 15 degrees, So minutes, Then a mean of the angles of position 78? 1 ',3 and 78' 12',9 taken the iith and 12th of March, being 7 8 4/north following, it will appear from the method of calculation of the Georgian planet. 345 which will be explained, that the inclination of the orbits of the satellites to the ecliptic is 780 58'. From these data it also follows, that the motion of the satellites in their revolutions round the planet, by which they are carried from their ascending node to their greatest elongation, is retrograde. Consideration of the principles by which the periodical revolution of the satellites may be obtainedfrom the observed angles of position. It will be necessary to premise, that, in order to simplify the investigation of the periodical revolution of the satellites, I have supposed the orbit of the Georgian planet, which aiffers only about 4 of a degree from the ecliptic, to be coincident with it. When the rate of the motion of a satellite in its orbit is to be determined from two observed situations, it is required to reduce its first apparent place on the plane of projection, to its real situation in its orbit, I have therefore taken the ascending -node for a fixed point, from which we may begin to number the degrees of the satellite's situation; then, as in the second observation, the satellite must also be brought from its apparent place to its real one, we have to allow for three material alterations, that will more or les. affect the calcula.. tion, according to the length of the interval of time between the two observations. The first of these alterations is that which takes place in the situation of the parallel, from which the angles are measured; the second is a change in the inclination of the plane of the orbit of the satellite to the plane of projection; and the ,MDCCCXV. Yy 346 Dr. HERSCHEL'S observations of the satellites third is an alteration in the distance between the ascending node and the extreme point of the transverse axis of the ellipsis, into which the orbit is projected. In figure 1, (P1. XVI.) suppose the circle PSFN to represent the plane of the orthographic projection, in which the angles of position are counted from the parallel P and F towards S and N, and expressed by the number of degrees ieo, 2o, 3o to go in each quadrant. Then let there be a moveable circle within the former, of which the degrees should be marked in succession, 1o, 20, 30 continued to 360. The inner circle being moveable, the line from 18o to 360 will express, by its different situations, the position of the transverse axis of the ellipsis into which the orbits of the satellites at any given time are projected. The conjugate extending from go to 270, and the lines parallel to it, will point out the direction in which the orbits will be more or less contracted according to the different inclinations of their planes to the plane of the prOjcion In a ttiangle PSp, figure 2, let P be the pole of the ecliptic. S. a point in the orbit of the satellite, go degrees distant from the ascending node. p, the point of the greatest northern elongation of the satellites, which on the moveable circle is marked 360. It is the zero of the ellipsis into which the orbits of the satellites are projected and its calculated situation wsill regulate the adjustment of the moveable circle. N, a point in a meridional direction, go degrees distant from the geocentric place of the planet. The arch PS then being the complement of the inclination of the satellite's orbit to the ecliptic, is therefore given; and the angle at P is equal to the distance of the longitude of the planet from the node. The Of the Georgian planet. A4t angle at S is a right one; and the arch PN, being the measure of the angle of position of that point of the ecliptic where the planet is situated, may be had by Table LIII, published in Dr. MASKELYNE'S first volume of Observations. To find what alteration has taken place in the situation of the parallel with regard to the point p, we calculate the position of this point for any given time by the following analogy. (1 ) cos P: rad : : tan PS: -tan Pp ; and the difference between PN and Pp will give Np ; the complement of which is the position of p, with regard to the parallel. When Pp is greater than PN, the position of P being north following, that of p will be north preceding; but when Pp is less than PN, it will. be north following. To find the inclination of the plane of the satellite's orbit to the plane of projection, we have only to calculate the distance of the poles of these planes; and since the place of the planet is the pole of the projecting plane, and -since also the situation of the pole of the orbits is known, which is in longitude iS degrees 3o -minutes of Gemini, and latitude south 11 9 ', therefore in the right angled triangle figure, of which GL is the distance of% the planet from the longitude of the pole, and PL the given latitude of the pole, we have the analogy (2) rad : cos GL: : cos PL: cos GP; which is the required inclination of the two planes to each other. To find the distance of the point p, or zero of the projected ellipsis from the ascending node, by figure 2, we have the analogy (3) rad : sin PS: : tan P: tan Sp; and goo + Sp before the node, and goo-Sp, after it, will give the distance of p, or zero point of the inner circle from the ascending node. Y y 2 348 Dr. HERSCHEL'S observations of the satellites The periodical revolutions of the satellites determined. In the natural order of investigating the motions of the satellites, the first consideration ought to be to identify the observations, lest a star should have been mistaken for a satellite, or one satellite for another; but as the calculations required for this purpose cannot be made without proper tables of their periodical revolutions, I have proceeded in the following manner. The earliest angles of the positions of the satellites which appeared to be sufficiently accurate for the purpose of settling their motions were taken 1787, February 16, 9h 38' mean time. With a wire for the parallel itt the focus of the eyeglass, and a magnifying power of 3oo, the position of the first satellite was five degrees north following; and that of the second was three degrees south following: the motion of the satellites being so near the parallel, there can be no material error in the estimation of the angles; and to prevent the influence of a diversity oferrors, I have fixed upon the above-mentioned time as a general epoch to which every calculation of the motion of the satellites has been referred not only in the determination of the periods, but also in every identification. With the assistance of the analogies that have been given, seven single periods of the revolution of the first satellite were calculated, from the union of which a general compound period has been deduced. The single periods werecalculated from a combination of the observation of the i6th of February 1787, with one of the same year, and -with six more of the years 1790, 91, 92, 93, 94 and 96. of the Georgian planet. 349 In the same manner, nine single periods of the second satellite have been calculated by combining the observation of the i6th of February 1787, with one or more of the succeeding, as far as 1797: the observations of 1798 being too close to the node to give a result that might be depended upon. It will be proper to give the particulars of one of the single periods, to show what degree of accuracy has been used in the calculation. By observation, the position of the second satellite, February tt6, 9h 38' 1787, was 3' sf. The situation of the parallel of declination, by analogy (1) was such that the point F, upon the outer circle of Fig. i. was opposite to 2610 14' of the inner circle; 80 sf therefore, was at 2580 14' of the inner circle. By analogy (2), we then find the inclination of the plane of the orbit to the plane of projection, which enables us, by the argument of the satellites being 780 14' from the greatest southern elongation, to reduce the apparent place in the circle to the real one, in the orbit elliptically projected. The correction for this reduction will be + 2' 27'; which being applied gives 26o' 41'. But this being the situation which is numbered from the moveable zero,. marked 360, it must be brought to its fixed distance from the ascending node by analogy (8) ; which gives the -distance of the zero from that node for this day lo4g o5'; and this being added to the former quantity, gives the real place of the satellite in its orbit from the ascending nodes0 6'. To combine this with the observation of March 28, 1 0hs6 1797, when the same satellite was 800 44' nf; we find that F., in the parallel should now point to 2810 4' of the inner circle ; and that consequently 800 4A' on the outer circle, will o50 Dr. HERSCHEL'S observations of the satellites be opposite to Id 48' of the inner circle; and that to reduce it by the inclination of the orbit, a correction of + 1~' 41' must be -applied, which gives its situation in the apparent elliptical orbit 170 41' from zero. And when the distance of this point from the ascending node, which now is 910 6', is added, we have the satellite's real place in its orbit 1080 47'. Then as in 1787, it was at ,5 6', and is now at io8' 47', it must have moved over an arch of 10o' 41' of its ,orbit, to which, if we add s74 revolutions, we find that the sum of its motion amounts to 98743,68 degrees. The interval of time, in which it has moved over this number of degrees, will be found to be 3693,040277.. days; from this we obtain the required periodical time, which is 13d iiP 8' i9". This single period differs only 40" from the compound mean period of the revolution of the second satellite. The seven detached periods of the first satellite, and the nine of the second have all been calculated in the same man.l ner; and in order to obtain a mean value of them, I judged it -proper to allow to the duration of every interval of the time, for which they were calculated, its due weight in the scale, by compounding them together. This wasdone by adding together the single intervals of time in each period, and also adding together the number of degrees" passed over in each single period, and computing then the compound period by these collected sums of times and motions, the result of which is, that the first satellite makes a synodical revolution about the planet in 8d 6h 56' 5",2, and the second in iRd ii.1 8' ,9a of the Georgian planet. 3 Explanation of the identifying method. It is evident, that we cannot be satisfied with a conclusion that is drawn from the apparent situation of an observed satellite, if a doubt should remain whether it actually was the satellite which it is said to be; and where such numerous observations are to be examined, a method of identifying the satellites becomes absolutely necessary. When the periodical revolution is known, the place where a satellite at any given time should be seen, may be strictly calculated; but a method somewhat less rigorous, and much more expedient, will be sufficient for the purpose; but even this will be found to require tedious computations; for in the first place, the motion of the satellite to be identified for any day, must be cast up by the table of its motion in days, hours, and minutes; and for this purpose, the interval of time for which it is calculated, must first be ascertained; this has been done for every day the satellites have been observed. The amount of the motion in orbit being obtained, it must be added to the number of degrees from which the motion proceeded; this at the already mentioned general epoch of 1787, Feb. G6, 90 38', 3vas for the first satellite 110 27' front the node, and for the second 50 6'. The sum then will be the real place of the satellite in its orbit. Now, to obtain the apparent place of a satellite from a given real one, a table must be made, the first column of which must contain the degree of the geocentric longitude of the planet, for which the rest of the columns are calculated. The three analogies that haVe been given, are to be used for obtaining the contents of the second, third, and fourth columns; 352 Dr. HERSCHEL'S observationsfof the satellites the fifth, contains the natural sine of the inclination given in the fourth column multiplied by 6. Such a Table has also been calculated for every degree, from three signs So0 to seven signs 120, which takes in the whole compass of the observations that have been given. I insert the three first lines of the Table as a sample of its con-, struction.

To the centro of this, I joined a moveable circle also drawn upon pasteboard, and graduated as in the figure. The radius of the inner circle was exactly six inches, and its circumference was nearly in contact with the inside of the outer circle. From what has already been said of the construction of this figure, its use in the identification of the satellites, will easily be understood by a few examples of it. With the geocentric longitude of the planet taken from the Nautical Almanack, I take out the required quantities from the different columns of the Table. In this operation it might be sufficient to take only the, nearest degree for entering the of the Georgian planet. 353 Table; but as the difference between any two degrees may be had by inspection, I have always used the nearest half degree. For instance, the quantities for the half degree between three signs 21? and 220, in the second, third, and fifth columns, will be 800 41'; 104] 45'; and 4,76. And the same quantities will do for any day from March 7, 1787, till April 23, for which day the quantities must be taken from three-signs s22 &c.-&c. Now, suppose it be required to ascertain whether a satellite called the second, which the i5th of March 1787, at 8k 7' wasobserved to be five degrees south following the planet, was indeed the second satellite ? Then I see in the general list of calculated motions, that from February i6, 9h 38' to March iS, 8h 7', is an interval of 26d e2h 29'; in which the second satellite has moved o0 1An' from its place; and as it was then at Ao 6', it is therefore now 50 18' from the ascending node of its orbit. In using the identifying apparatus, the first thing to be done is, the adjustment of the inner circle to the position it ought to have for the day of observation, which is pointed out by the geocentric longitude of the planet three signs o'i degrees; the zero must consequently be adjusted to 800 41' north preceding; I therefore turn the inner circle upon its centre, till the point 360 is opposite to 8o0 ? np for in the adjustment of the circles' to each other, and in reading off the angles pointed out by them, a critical estimation of minutes has not been attempted; whenever, therefore minutes are given, they must be understood to relate to calculations, or to measures taken with a micrometer. In the next place, the point of the inner circle, answering MDCCCXV. Z Z 3$54 Dr. HERSCHEL'S observations of the satellites to the calculated situation of the satellite in its orbit, is to be found by the tabular quantity 104i 45, which is the distance of the ascending node from the zero of that circle; and as the satellite is 50 i8' from the same node, the quantity given by the Table must be deducted from the same; that is from 3650 i8', and the remainder 26O? 003' will be the place of the satellite on the moveable circle. Finally, to get the angle of position at which the satellite will be seen the two ends of a proportional compass must be adjusted to each other, so that when one end of it is opened to six inches, the other may give the quantity in the last column of the Table, which in the present case is 4,76 inches. The distance from 26o-L to the transverse must then be measured by the long end of the compass, in a direction parallel to the lines in the figure;and the opening of the short end must be set back again in thesame direction, from the transverse towards s6ol0; a fine point must be marked with the end of it upon the pasteboard. A black silk thread fixed to the centre of the circle, may then be stretched over the impressed point to intersect the degrees of the outer circle, upon which the positions are reckoned in the order they aremarked; and this being done, it will be seen that the intersection of the thread falls upon 2degrees of the south following quadrant; which sufficiently identifies the satellite. In observations that are made when we are in, or very near the node of the orbits of the satellites, their angular positions undergo hardly any change, and can therefore be of no use for identifying them; but they may then be distinguished by their proportional distances from the planet; and these may be very conveniently had in six hundredth parts of the Georgian planet. of the respective radii of the satellites, and the impression of the fine point whereby the angle of position is ;obtained will be of eminent use; for by putting one leg of the compass upon this point, and extending the other to the centre of the circle, we shall in the present case have 4,8 X inches for the measure of the required distance, which as the radius of the circle is six inches, will be 481 parts of it; and in such parts all the distances which are given in the foregoing observartions have been expressed. I have called this manner of obtaining the angles of position and proportional distances, the identifying method, that it may remain distinguished from strict computation; there is, however, so much real calculation mixed with it, that I may confidently draw the following interesting conclusions from it. I. With the light of my eo feet telescope, the first satellite generally becomes invisible at the distance of a little more than half its greatest elongation; I suppose it to be when the identified measure of it is from 3o0 to about 310. II. The second satellite becomes invisible at very nearly half the distance of its greatest elongation; I suppose it to be when its identified distance is from 295 to about 3o5, III. An interior satellite as large as the first, must be more than half the greatest elongation of the first satellite from the planet; and if it be smaller, it must be at so much greater a distance from the planet, to be seen at its greatest elongation. Nor can there be any chance for seeing it two nights together, when the orbits are contracted by projection. -356 Dr. HERSCHEL'S observations of the satellites IV. Exterior satellites that are very faint when at their greatest elongation, can hardly ever be seen at any other time when the orbits are contracted. V. The first satellite is probably larger than the second; for though the latter is generally the brightest, it seems to be only in consequence of its being farthest from the planet. On comparing the limit of its disappearance with the number o302 expressing that at which the first satellite generally ceases to be visible, we find that the second satellite, upon its own scale, should not be lost in the light of the planet till it came within the limit of 224, instead of 295. VI. Both the satellites are subject to great variations of light, not owing to the changeable clearness of the air at different times for by comparing the brightness of one satellite with that of the other when they are seen together, the state of the air will be of equal clearness to both, and yet their comparative brightness has been observed to be very different: for instance, March 14, 1793, the first satellite was brighter than the second, when the distance of the former was to that of the latter as 172 to 235; and February 26, 1798, the first was small, and the second larger when the distance of the former was to that of the latter as 175 to 20O. VII. b he variable brightness of the satellites nmay be owing to a rotation upon their axes, whereby they alternately present different parts of their surfaces to our view. These variations may also arise from their having atmospheres that occasionally hide or expose the dark surface of their bodies, as is the case with the sun, Jupiter and Saturn. VIII. The real angular distances of the satellites from the planet nmay be determined from the measures that are given in of the Georgzan planet. 3 S7 the observations, but to enter critically into this subject would extend far beyond the compass of this Paper. The disagree. ment of the measures is very considerable ; this will, however, not appear so remarkable, when the faintness of the satellites is considered, which will not admit of an illumination of the wires of the micrometer. The two measures of the distance of the first satellite that were taken Oct. 11, 1787, and March 12, 1798, should both be considered; but a selection of about six of the most consistent measures of the second satellite, will probably be necessary to give the truest result. For instance, those of 1787, March i8, 20, April 9, and November 9, with those of 1798, March 12 and 19, might be taken. If these measulres are brought to their greatest elongation by the identified distances that are given with them, some kind of judgment may be formed of the probable result, when calculation is applied to them. In my observations I have supposed the distances of the first and second satellites to be 36 and 48 seconds, and by this proportion I have occasionally reduced the identified distances of the two satellites to an equal scale. IX. The existence of additional satellites has already been considered in a former paper.* Many remarks on them were given under the four heads of interior, intermediate, exterior, and more distant satellites; and, as many additions are contained in the foregoing observations, I shall review the former remarks, with the assistance of the light which the identifying method has thrown upon them, and afterwards, in the same order consider, in each class, what evidence of the existence of such satellites may be derived from the additional observations, especially from those that were made in the year* Phl. Trans. for x798, page 59. Dr. HERSCHEL'S observations of the satellites 1798, when the orbits of the satellites were contracted into a line, which might be examined with greater facility than a more expanded space; and where even the very situation of a star in this given direction, rather than in the numberless others, in which it might be placed, must be a presumption of its being a satellite, provided its distance at the same time should not exceed a certain probable limit. An interior satellite. The supposed interior satellite observed January i8, 179o, could not be a star, whose existence was doubtful, as it had light enough for an estimation of its distance in diameters oi the planet ; its absence, however, not having been noticed the 19th of January, although great attention has been shown to ascertain the sidereal nature of another supposed satellite, observed at the same time with the formner, leaves the observation of the eighteenth unsupported. The observation of the 4th of March 1794, which has been supposed to relate to an interior satellite, is by the identifying method proved to belong to the second satellite; and its observed absence on the 5th from the place where it was the 4th, being thus verified and accounted for, shows that great confidence may be placed on such observations. The observation of an interior satellite of the 27th of March, 1794, is without a subsequent observation ; but then it has already been noticed in remark Ill, that an interior satellite cannot be seen two successive days, when its orbit is already contracted as it was on the day of observation. of the Georgian planet. Addition. The 15th of February, 1798, an interior satellite was seen about its greatest northern elongation; as it was between the planet and the second satellite (miscalled the fifth), its position must have been 840 49' nf. On account of its faintness it was not seen immediately, but as soon as it was perceived, it was surmised to be the second satellite ; but the identified distance of the second, whichr was 455, is much too far for the observed distance of the faint satellite, and proves that in reality the supposed fifth was the second satellite. ThisD is moreover confirmed by its brightness, and by the angle of position which was taken. The first satellite was invisible, its distance being only 124; it even remained invisible the next day, when its distance was 289; the observed faint one, therefore, -must have been an interior satellite in a distant part of its northern elongation. The i6th of February, the place where the satellite had been the day before was scrupulously examined in looking for the supposed fifth, and as there was no star remaining in that place, the removal of the interior satellite from its former situation was thereby also ascertained. It has already been noticed that in the contracted position of the orbits an interior satellite observed the i5th could not possibly be seen the <6th, which accounts for its not being noticed the last day of observation. This is one of the cases where the singular situation of a star alone, is almost sufficient to prove it to be a satellite. The 17th of April, i8oi, the interior satellite, which had been seen in its greatest northern elongation, was now seen about its greatest southern elon gation. Its situation, by 360 Dr. HERSCHEL'S observations of the satellites identification, was 8Af sp. The i8th of April, when the stars that were pointed out were looked after, and were all found remaining in their places, no star could be seen where the interior satellite had been situated the 17th nor could it be expected to be visible, as, by its motion towards the planet, it must already have been involved in the splendour of its light. An intermediate satellite. The 26th of March, 1794, an intermediate satellite was seen; by the configuration its distance was greater than that of the first, but less than that of the second. By identification its situation must have been ,9 I nf. The 27th of March, the satellite was no longer in the place where it had been seen the 26th, and moreover, a very small star was seen in a place that agreed with what would be the situation of an intermediate satellite, had it accompanied the planet. An exterior satellite. The 9th of February, 1790, an exterior satellite was observed. It was by the configuration at double the -distance of the second satellite, and by identification, its position was 64l sf. The observations of two succeeding days proved, that it remained no longer 'in the place where it had been seen on the 9th. The 27th of March, 1794, some distant stars south of the planet were observed as being supposed satellites; but they are not sufficiently supported by succeeding observations. The 5th of March 1796, a star was seen, which the night before had not been in the place where it was at the time of the observation. By the configuration its identified place of the Georgian planctA 36 must have been 72 np; and its distance exceeded that of the second satellite. Addition. The Sist of January, 1791, a satellite in opposition to tne second, and at about double the distance from the planet was observed; its identified position was 78Z np. The 2d of February all the stars of the configuration that had been pointed out, were seen remaining in their places, but the exterior satellite was not among them. The 26th of February, 1792, a star at double the distance of the first satellite was pointed out, but it has not been accounted for in succeeding observations. By remark IV, however, faint exterior satellites can hardly be expected to be seen at any other time, than when they are about their greatest elongation. The iith of February, 1798, an exterior satellite, called the fifth, wvas observed; its situation was measured 890 19',5 nf. The i.3th of February, this satellite was no longer in the place where it had been seen the ti th. The i5th of February it was again ascertained that the satellite had left its former situation. The orbits of the satellites, at the time of these observations, were already contracted into a line, and a very faint satellite like this could not remain visible two, and four days successively; its motion, according to remark IV, would in a short time immerge it again into the effusive light of the planet, and render it invisible. More distant satellites. The 28th of February, T794, a small, star was seen in a place where the 26th there was none. By the coafiguration MDcccxv. $ A 362 Dr. HERSCHEL'S observations of the satellites, &c. of that day,,and the identifying method, it was at a consider. able distance, about 24 degrees north following the planet, and not far from a lettered star which was smaller than the new star. It cannot be supposed that a larger star should have been omitted to have been marked in the situation pointed out by smaller lettered stars, where it must have been seen the 26th, if it had been there. The 27th of March, 1794, south of the planet, at a considerable distance, were small stars, that had the appearance of satellites; but there are no subsequent observations of them. The 28th of March, 1797, a distant star is mentioned that was not seen the 25th, although the situation of the lettered stars of that day was carefully examined. Addition. The i6th of February, 1798, at 11h 12' a very faint satellite, called the sixth, was observed, and from its distance, supposed to be a little before or after its greatest southern elongation. It was so faint, that a small alteration in the clearness of the air, rendered it invisible. On the i8th the sixth satellite was seen again, and, being nearer the planet than it was on the i6th at 1lh I ', it was supposed to be on its return from the greatest southern elongation. It was also ascertained on the i8th, that it had left the place where it was seen on the i6th. The angle of its position, by a measure taken of it, was 82' j,' south preceding.
