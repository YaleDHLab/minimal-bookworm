[181] XVII. On a Method of describing the relative Positions and Magnitudes of the Fixed Stars; together with some Astronomical Observations. By the Rev. Francis Wollaston, LL.B. F. R. S. Read February 5, 1784. F R O M some alterations which have of late years been discovered, in the relative positions and apparent magnitudes of a few of the stars we called fixed, it seems not unreasonable to conclude, that there may be many changes among others of them we little suspect. This thought has led me into a wish, that some method were adopted whereby to detect such motions. The first idea which occurred to me was, to make a proposal to astronomers in general; that each should undertake a strict examination of a certain district in the heavens; and, not only by a re-examination of the catalogues hitherto published, but by taking the right ascension and declination of every star in their several allotment, to frame an exact map of it, with a corresponding catalogue; and to communicate their observations to one common centre. This is what I could be glad to see begun. Every astronomer must wish it, and therefore every one should be ready to take his share in it. Such a plan, undertaken with spirit, and carried on gradually with care, would, by the joint labours and emulation of so many astronomers as are now in Europe, produce a celestial Atlas fan beyond any thing that has ever yet appeared. 7 But 182 Mr. WOLLASTON'S Method of describing the relative But this would be a work of time, and not within the compass of every one. What I mean now to propose is more immediate; and not out of the reach of any who amuse themselves with viewing the heavenly bodies. Meridian altitudes and transits can be taken but once in 24 hours; and, though accurate, are therefore tedious. Neither can any re-examination of them be made, but with the same labour as at the first. Equatorial sectors are in the hands of few; and require great skill. Some more general method seemed wanting; to discover variations, which, when detected or only surmised, should be consigned immediately to a more strict investigation. Turning this in my thoughts, I considered, that the noting down at the time the exact appearance of what one sees, would be far more simple, and shew any alterations in that appearance more readily, than any other method. A Drawing once made would remain, and could be consulted at any future period; and if it were drawn at first with care, a transient review would discover to one, whether any sensible change had taken place since it was last examined. Catalogues, or verbal Descriptions of any kind, could not answer that end so well. To do this with ease and expedition was then the requisite: and a telescope with a large field, and some proper sub-divisions in it, to direct the eye and assist the judgement, seemed to bid most fair for success. The following is the method which, after various trials, I have adopted, and think I may now venture to recommend. To a night-glass, but of DOLLOND'S improved construction, which magnifies about six times, and takes in a field of just about as many degrees of a great circle, I have added cross wires, intersecting each other at an angle of 45~. More wires 6 may Positions and Magnitudes of the Fixed Stars, &c. 183 may be crossed in other directions; but I apprehend these will be found sufficient. This telescope I mount on a polar axis. One coarsely made, and without any divisions on its circle of declination, will answer this purpose, since there is no great occasion for accuracy in that respect: but as the heavenly bodies are more readily followed by an equatorial motion of the telescope, so their relative positions are much more easily discerned when they are looked at constantly as in the same direction. An horizontal motion, except in the meridian, would be apt to mislead the judgement. It is scarcely necessary to add, that the wires must stand so as for one to describe a parallel of the equator nearly. Another will then be a horary circle; and the whole area will be divided into eight equal sectors. Thus prepared, the telescope is to be pointed to a known star, which is to be brought into the centre or common intersection of all the wires. The relative positions of such other stars as appear within the field, are to be judged-of by the eye: whether at 1/2, or 1/3, or 1/4 from the centre towards the circumference, or vice versa; and so with regard to the nearest wire respectively. These, as one sees them, are to be noted down with a black lead pencil upon a large message card held in the hand, upon which a circle, similarly divided, is ready drawn. (One of three inches diameter seems most convenient.) The motion of the heavenly bodies in such a telescope is so slow, and the noting down of the stars so quickly done, that there is most commonly full time for it without moving the telescope. When that is wanted, the principal star is easily brought back again into the centre of the field at pleasure, and the work resumed. After a little practice, it is astonishing how near one can come to the truth in this way: and, though neither the right ascensions nor the declinations are laid down by 184 Mr. WOLLASTON'S Method of describing the relative by it, nor the distances between the stars measured; yet their apparent situations being preserved in black and white, with the day and year, and hour if thought necessary, written underneath, each card becomes a register of the then appearance of that small portion of the heavens; which is easily re-examined at any time with little more than a transient view; and which yet will shew on the first glance, if there should have happened in it any variation of consequence. It is obvious, that very delicate observations are not to be made in this way. In order to explain my meaning more fully, a card so marked shall accompany this paper (see tab. V. fig. 1.). What I first happened to pitch upon was the constellation of Corona Borealis, which then fronted one of my windows; and which I have since pursued throughout in this method; making the stars ~, ~, ~, ~, ~, ~, ~, ~, ~, ~, ~, ~, and ~, successively central; together with one or two belonging to Bootes, for the sake of connecting the whole together. These I have transferred since on a sheet of paper, to try how well they would unite into one map; which they have done with very little alteration. A copy of that shall also be laid before this Society (fig. 2.). My design was, after marking down all such stars as are visible with so small a magnifier, to go over the whole again with another telescope of a higher power, divided in the same way; and after that, with a third and a fourth; so as to comprehend every star I could discern. That would discover smaller changes: but it must be a work of time, if attempted at all. After such a rough map of the constellation is made, the endeavouring to ascertain the right ascensions and declinations of these, may perhaps be adviseable in the next place, rather than searching for more. In Positions and Magnitudes of the Fixed Stars, &c. 185 In observing in this way it is manifest, that the places of such stars as happen to be under or very near any one of the wires, must be more to be depended upon, than of what are in the intermediate spaces, especially if towards the edges of the field: so also what are nearest to the centre, because better defined, and more within the reach of one wire or another. For this reason, different stars in the same set must successively be made central, or brought towards one of the wires, where any suspicion arises of a mistake, in order to approach nearer to a certainty: but if the stand of the telescope be tolerably well adjusted and fixed in its place, that is soon done. In such a glass it is very seldom that light is wanting sufficient to discern the wires. When an illuminator is required, I find, that for this purpose, where you wish to see every small star you can, a piece of card or white paste-board, projecting on one side beyond the tube, and which may be brought forward occasionally, is better than one of any other kind. By cutting across a small segment of the object-glass, it throws a sufficient light down the tube, though a candle is at a great distance; and one may lose sight of that false glare when one pleases, by drawing back the head, and moving the eye a little side-ways, and then one sees the smaller stars just as well as if no illuminator were there. This then is the method I would recommend to the practical astronomer, for becoming acquainted with the appearance of the stars, and setting a watch over the heavenly motions. After a very few trials, every one would find this easy. And if each person of every rank among astronomers would take a constellation or two under his care, the numbers who could undertake it in this way would compensate for the defects of a plan which cannot aspire at great accuracy. The labour of VOL. LXXIV. B b it, 186 Mr. WOLLASTON'S Method of describing the relative it, even at first, is but little. It has cost me more time indeed than I ought commonly to allot to mere amusement; because I had my apparatus to contrive, and several different and fruitless schemes to try, before I could satisfy myself. But a quarter, or at the most half, an hour is generally sufficient for the marking of one pretty full card in this way: and when once the cards are marked, and a general map of the constellation is formed, a little time given to it in a fine evening, to examine whether the stars on such or such a card remain in their former position, is little trouble indeed. Perseverance is most likely to be wanting, and therefore must be determined upon; because, after finding things time after time just as they were, one's hopes of discovering any thing new will slacken. But the different state of the air, or of one's own eye, will frequently occasion a fresh star to become visible, or a small one which had been noted down to seem to have disappeared; and such a mere accident will serve to re-kindle the desire of pursuing it. Besides, if we observe no change after a tolerable interval of assiduous search, we may at any time turn to another constellation: yet ought we never to abandon the former entirely, after having once publickly undertaken it, without giving notice of our so doing. In the cards or maps, it may be observed, I have not marked the respective sizes of the stars. Nor have I distinguished them in any way, excepting a few of them with BAYER'S Greek letters. It was because I have not hitherto satisfied myself how to do it. Some method must be used by every one, to describe to himself what he means; but, in laying any thing before the public, a deference ought to be paid to what has been done by others. The calling any star by a new name would breed confusion: and as I was desirous this should appear before this Society Positions and Magnitudes of the Fixed Stars, &c. 187 Society in its first rude form, that a judgement might be made from it how far such a scheme would promise success, I was unwilling to look into catalogues or capital maps for the numbers or names of the stars, lest I should be tempted to adapt the positions of what I had observed to what I there found set down by more able astronomers. Nothing, therefore, but a hemisphere of SENEX has been consulted, just for knowing how far the constellation is usually reckoned to extend, and what are BAYER'S references. Should this plan meet with approbation, I shall be happy to have proposed it; and will endeavour to forward it in any way that shall be judged proper: or should any other be preferred, which is within the abilities and leisure of one who is engaged in another profession, I shall be as happy to lend what assistance I can to it. My aim is only, to render such observations as I am capable of making, useful to science. Before I conclude on this head, give me leave to add a few hints. Whether this method be followed, or any other, if a general plan be set on foot, whoever undertakes a constellation, or district, should determine to examine it with as great accuracy as he can; yet never be ashamed to let others know of his mistakes. The error of one proves a caution to another. Such a rough sketch, once made, will be found of great use to most of us, in knowing which star next to examine with greater care. He who can do no more than this, will do a useful work by going thus far: and his frequently sweeping over his district in this way, may lead him to a discovery which might escape a more regular astronomer. But whoever can, ought to do more. By degrees the exact positions of every star he has noted down may be ascertained, by the method practised by Mr. DE LA CAILLE in his Southern Hemisphere, or by any B b 2 other 188 Mr. WOLLASTON'S Method of describing the relative other which shall be esteemed more convenient. Every one, indeed, must use such instruments as he can procure: but assiduity can do more with indifferent ones, than will ever be accomplished with the very best without it. Whatever references are made for one's own convenience, when a map and catalogue are given to the public stock, the old letters and numbers should be retained as far as they go: though yet notice should be taken, where the magnitudes of the stars at present do not appear to correspond with the order in which they have been laid down. To render this more complete, it were to be wished, that each should give in a copy of his original observations, with an account of the instruments he used; since they ought to be preserved as data from whence his deductions were made, which may then be re-examined at any future time. Yet must it be desired, that no one would trust himself without carrying on his calculations as fast as the observations are made: they will otherwise multiply upon his hands till the labour will dishearten him from attempting it at all. A heap of crude, undigested observations would be an unwelcome present to the public. Having thus stated this Proposal, I shall leave it to be proceeded upon, or not, as shall be seen proper: And will now only subjoin a List of such occasional observations as I have had opportunity of making, since the last which I communicated to this Society. I find, indeed, that it is much longer than I had apprehended: but as I perceive some astronomers abroad have referred to a few of those which have been honoured with a place in our Transactions, it may be as well to follow it up. An observation retained among one's own private papers I hold to be of little use. One Positions and Magnitudes of the Fixed Stars, &c. 189 One thing let me desire Foreigners to remark: that the registers I gave of the going of my clock were meant only as the relations of a mere fact; that a clock, of such a construction, kept or altered its rate so or so. They seem to have understood it as an account of a capital clock, by valuing themselves upon some of theirs going better. The time-keepers in most of our Observatories are far more accurate; but, excepting those of the Royal Observatory at Greenwich, their accuracy is not made public. Another remark it may also be proper to make; that, since my former papers, the longitude of this place has been ascertained by comparative observations on the bursting of some rockets, let off on purpose; which, on a mean of several, turns out to be 19~,02 in time E. of Greenwich Observatory; that is, it may hereafter be considered as 19~, instead of 18~,6 as I had before calculated it trigonometrically from the bearings.
