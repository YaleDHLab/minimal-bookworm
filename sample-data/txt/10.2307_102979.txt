SW by W 0~ 38 Th 2 14 19 94 4 06 2 19 16 04 This (1879) This Illustrious Society having been pleased to accept of Mr Townley's and my Observations compared, concerning the height of the Mercury, &c. for divers years, to the year 1702, which were published in the Transactions; it may not, I hope, be unacceptable to continue these Observations as far as Mr Towneley hath gone with them, till his Removal from Towneley. And having room, I have added his Observations also of the Weather and Winds on the first day of every month, together with my own at the same time, extracted out of my larger Tables, now in the Society's custody. From whence these things may be observed. 1. That (as I have often observed in some other Papers) there is every year much more Rain falleth at Towneley than Upminster. By the assistance of an Ingenious Learned Member of this Society, I have an Extract of the Rain at Paris and Lisle, as far as the French have published their Observations. And by comparing the Rain of one place with that of another, I find that there is about twice as much Rain falleth at Townley, as doth either at Upminster, Paris, or Lisle. Mr Towneley hath formerly observed in one of the Transactions, that as much more Rain falleth at Townley as Paris. And Mr de la Hire observes, that more Rain falleth at Lisle than Paris. But Towneley doth far exceed, as hath been said, and will appear by particulars. At Lisle, one year with another, the Depth of the Rains amount to 22 inches 3 lines, Paris measure, or 23 in. 3 l. which make about 23 1/2 inches English, or 24 1/2. At Paris, one year with another, they amount to 20 inches 3 1/2 lines Paris measure, which is near 22 inches English. But at Towneley, one year with another, according to Mr Towneley's computation formerly, the Rains amount to above 41 inches depth. And by taking eight other years, in which the Rain was observed both at Towneley (1880) Towneley and Upminster (viz. from 1696 to 1704.) I and that all the 8 years Rain at Towneley amounteth to bove 1700 l. Troy, at Upminster 823 l only. Which said summs being divided by 8, give 212 l. 1/29 one year with another, at Towneley, and near 103 l. at Upminster. Each of which summs being doubled, and making a Decimal Fraction of the last Figure, doth nearly give the number of inches, which all the Rain would have risen to, if the Earth had not swallowed it up, viz. 42 ~ inches at Towneley, and about 20 1/2 inches at Upminster. Wherefore the Rain at Upminster is less than at Paris, at Paris than at Lisle, and at every one of the places less than at Towneley by much. The reason of which vast surmount at Towneley, is doubtless from the height of the Hills thereabouts, which retard or stop the Westerly Clouds: From which Point the Winds blow more than any other here in England. But 2. Notwithstanding the great disproportion of Rain between one place and another, yet there is a great agreement between our Barometers; one Rising or Falling when the other doth; and that much, or little, as the other doth, although not always exactly in the same proportion. And this is what I find Monsieur Maroldi hath observed, by comparing his Observations at Paris with mine at Upminster, in the years 1697 and 1698. Only at Paris the ~ is commonly 3 or 4 lines lower than at Upminster. And so it appears to be at Towneley, from this and some other Tables, viz. 3 or 4 tenths of an inch lower at Towneley than at Upminster. Which is an argument that Towneley and Paris are situated higher above the surface of the Sea than Upminster (which is nearly in the same level with London) is. 3. Another thing shewn by the foregoing Table is, That there is some agreement between the Winds at Towneley and Upminster. Which although not always exactly (881) exactly in the same Point, yet do often tend the same way, blowing within a Point or two perhaps of the same course; especially when the Wind is somewhat strong. Or if the Winds have differed, yet the Scudd (as the Seamen call the current of the Clouds) hath commonly shown the motion of the upper Air to agree thereto. This I say doth often happen, though not always. And this also Monsieur Maraldi hath observed at Paris in the aforesaid years, viz. `` That there are a great `` many days, during the different Seasons of the year, `` where the Winds are the same in both Places, [i. e. `` Paris and Upminster.] When the Wind was the same, `` both in one part and the other, it was ordinarily `` pretty strong, and of long continuance. And also he `` observed that the Winds had changed alike in both `` Places. Vid. Hist. de l' Acad. Roy. des Sciences An. 1699. L l l l l l l l l l l IV. Astro
