Witsen to Dr. Martin Lister, with two Draughts of the Famous Persepolis. THIS Ingenious and Inquisitive Gentleman having already often obliged the World with Communications of his Discoveries, lately sent the following Letter with the Draughts to Dr. Lister, who was pleased to permit their Publication in these Tracts: The greatness of the Curiosity we hope will recommend them to the Lovers of Antiquity, little of those Famous Remains having been yet publisht, and those that have been, but ill designed or graved. Monsieur Witsen's Letter, translated from the French, is as follows. S S I R, (118) S I R, SInce I had the Honour of receiving your last, there came to my hands several Curious Shells from you, with a piece of English Agate, and the Transactions of the Royal Society for the Month of June last, for which Favours I return my Humble Thanks. As to the Cockles of the Caspian Sea, and from the Mouth of Wolga, I have Advice from Moscou, that they are expected there this Winter: Meanwhile I herewith send you some SnailShells, taken out of the River Jaute, not far from the City of Moscou. Our Apothecaries make use of them powdered, and probably for the same purpose as CrabsEyes. There are some others likewise which are found in the Rivers of Moscou and Neglina, and in the Wolga. Since you have been pleased to communicate to me an Inscription found at Persepolis, I thought it would be acceptable to send you the Draughts of part of the Ruins of the Stone-work of that Proud Palace, given me by the Person himself that drew them upon the place. I should be much satisfied had I any thing worthy of your Curiosity and the Publick, which you so often Oblige with your Discoveries, which justly merit mine and the Thanks of all that esteem them as much as my self, who am the Cherisher of your Friendship, and desirous to shew that I am, S I R, Tour most Humble and Obedient Servant, Amsterdam, N. Witsen. Jan. 1. 1694.
