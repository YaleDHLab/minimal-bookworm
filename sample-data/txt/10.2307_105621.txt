[231] XLIV. An Account of the Observations made upon the Transit of Venus over the Sun, 6th June 1761, at Cajaneburg in Sweden, by Mons. Planman: Communicated in a Letter from Mr. Peter Wargentin, Secretary to the Royal Academy of Sciences in Sweden, and F. R. S. to Mr. John Ellicott, F. R. S. Translated from the French. Stockholm, October 30, 1761 I N a letter, of the 7th of August, which I wrote to you, I communinicated to you some observations on the late transit of Venus, made in Sweden, and, among these, that of Mons. Planman, made at Cajanebourg. Since that time, some new observations have shewn, that the difference of meridians between Stockholm and Cajanebourg is only 38~ 40~ to 45~, that is, half a minute less than I presumed then. This correction has convinced Mons. Planman, that, in his observation on the interior contact of the limbs of Venus and the sun, there has happened an error of a minute; not through the fault of the observer, but that of his assistant, who counted the seconds at the clock: so that, instead of 10h 8~ 58~, it should be 10h 7~ 58~. I think it extremely probable, that this is the fact; for, upon this correction, all the observations of Mons. Planman agree very well with each other, and with those of the other astronomers. XLV.
