VI. Systema Horticulturae, containing in English the Art of Gardening in Three Books; by J.W. Gentl. 80. GArdens and Nurseries are the Life and Relief, the Health and the Beauty of London. These with fair Orchards, salubrious Groves and Vineyards, are lately become the Glory of the Campaign all about London,for many miles in Kent, Surrey, Sussex, Middle sex, Hartfordshire and Esses: I may add Hampshire, Barkshire, Buckinghamshire, Oxfordshire, Suffolk, and in all the Environs approaching the Royal Palaces. Vineyards have climbed up Windsor-hill,and (as we hear) they begin to adorn some of the Mountains in South Wales. But many remote parts of England are not so forward for the best sorts of Gardens,as about London. Therefore I do here take notice of a New Book for Gardens, which treateth first of the Excellency, Scituation, Soyl, Form, Walks,&c. of Gardens. Secondly, of all sorts of Trees planted for Ornament or Shade, Winter-greens, Flower-trees, and Flowers. Thirdly, of the Kitchin-garden, and of the great variety of Plants propagated for food, and for any culinary Uses. Illustrated with Sculptures, representing the Forms of Gardens, according to some of the newest Models. Errat.in Numb.135. Pag.878.lin.antepen.read blanqueting Trade.
