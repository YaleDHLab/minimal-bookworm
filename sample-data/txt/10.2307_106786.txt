: 225 3SIv A AIeteorological yournal, princip-lly relating to Mtrnostberzcal Electricity; kept at Krsightsbridge, Sfrom tbe gth qf May, z790, to tbe 8th of WIay 1791. By lWr. John Read; coznrzunzcated by Riclaard Henry Ales. 13ennetn Esq. F. R. S. Read April 26, oys2. A DESCRIPTION of the instruments for collecting atmospherical electricity used in the folloswillg journal. fFig. 1 and 2 (ltab. IV.) represent the apparatus. AA fig. 1, is a round deal rod, 20 feet long, twoinches diameter at the lover, and one inch at tlle upper end: into the lower end of it is celnented a solid glass pillar B, 22 inclaes long; the lowver end of this glass stands in a socket of wood C) wlaich is screved on the garret floor D, and supports the whole. About seven feet above the floorn is firmly fixed to the snJall a strong arm of wcrod E, B>hich holds perpendicularly a strorlg glass tube F, through which the rod is slided gently upsvards, till the glass pillar B may be lowered into the socket C. It is thus fixed and stands 12 inches frotn the wall The tube F is of sufficient width to admit a case of cork, which is fastened inthe inside of it, at the part where the tube is sustained by the arm of wood E, so that the rod, when bent by the wind, cannot touch the tube or break it. Tlae upper extremity of the rod is termirlated by several slaarppointed wires G; two of them are of copper) each one-eighth of an inch thick; and, in order to stiffien the rodn as well as conduct more readily the GMr. READ'S lzeteorological yournatelectric fluids one of them is twisted round the-rod to the right lland, and tlle otlaer to the eft, as low doun as the brass collar H, to which they are soldered, in order to render their contact perfect. A little above t}le upper end of the glass plllar B, is placed a brace II of solid glass sticks, to keep steady that part of tlle rod. K is a 11ollour cylinder of wood, g=inches ulithin, proceedilzg from the ceiling through the roof LL, above svhicll tlaere is a hollow tin cover M, 24 illCheS within, fxed to the rod; wlaich serves to defend tlae open cylinder K from the veather. At a collvenient distance-frolx3L the foot of the rod is a hole bored through the floor and ceilint,. This hole receives a glass tube covered with sealingwax (as are all the other glasses in this apErarattls), through which a strong brass wire proceedirlg from t]le rod is correyed into the room below, wllerein, at a convetlient height from the floor, it terminates with a two-inch brassball N. A strong rillg of brass is made to m<ve easy on the wire, atld rests on the brass baII ; illtO this ring is screwed4f a brass wire seven inches long, which keeps suspended at its extremity a pith-ball electrolneter 0. At tsvo irsches distaI3ce of the above-mentiolledS brass ball N, a bell P is supported by a strong wirev uthich passing thrcough a hole made in the wall,-is tnade to communicate, by means of a good metallic continuation Q, with the tuoist ground adjc)ining to the house. A brass ball, three-tenths of an inch in diameter, is suspended beteZeen the bell P and ball N, by a silk thread fastened to a laail R. This ball serves for a clapper, by striking betsveen the ball and bell, when the electrical charge of the rod is sufficiently strong. V gives nearly a front view of this part of the apparatus2 relating to Atsnospheri( al Electrzcity. 2Z7 S is:a small table fised to the wall under tlle bell and ball, at a convenient }:<eigllt above the floor, upon which Leyden bottles and other apparatus are occasionally placed. Any person versed irl the science of electricity, will easilyunderstand thal; th:is apparatus is calculated to show the various de-grees of intensity of atmospherical electricity; and at the same time to avoid the pernicious effiects which may be occasioned by thunder-storms, or in short by any great quantity of electricity ila the atmosphere. t The uThole perpendictllar height of both parts of this appa ratus taken together3 from the moist earth to tlle point at the top of the rod, is (il feet. If the insulation could be constantly kept in clue temperature, with respect to heat and cold, Iimagine it would always be electrified. But I fear that; cannot be done, without tlle ai(l of conlmon fire; which in soE large an apparatus woulcI be very difficult, so that there might not be too much nor too little of it. I am inclined to this opitlion, from the success I have had in a number of experimentsn in hich the aid of common fire was applied to ;mprove the insulation, as well as to collect the electric fluid. When I find that the moisture in the air has so mucll inJured the irlsulation of lny high pointed rod, that it will not -retain a-weak electricity, sa that case T make use of my hand exploring rod, which is about the length and thickness of a common fishing-rod, vvith plenty ozf small wire twined round it from end to erld. The method of using itois simple and easy. A representatioz of i-t may be distinctly seen in fig. 2; JIaving first warmed the glass legs of the stool, I place myself upon it, and raise the rod into a vertical positiorl, keeping it $o for a minute or two; I thell with a finger 22gSIr. READ'S Meteorological yournalof -the other hantltouch a sensible electromet:ers and Xif the threads opell, it is sufficient. But should the electrical state ofthe ttmospherebe too weak to produce that effect, which seldom happens, thell in that case I -add to the rod a 7igZted torch T,:and place it as renlotefrom tny hand as the strength of the rod-will bear, and repeat the experiment; thus-cir cumsta;nced,0it has never yet failed me. eI:t-will be necessary just to mentioll the method I have pursued ill forming the journal of atmospherical electricity. This htas been principally :by means of the signs exhibited by the pith baIls 0, connected with the rod. When I::find tlzese . . closed, and attracted on the approach of my finger, yet not sufficierltly charged to repel each other, I vvrite sveak signs of electricity. When I fitld the balls openg atld, on the ap proach of excited glass, the balls close, I write they are electrified pc)sitively; buty if the balls open vvider, I svrite they are electrified negatively; and the reverse when I use sealingwax. \Vllen the balls diverge one inch and upwards, visible $parks may be drawn at the brass ball SN. \Yhen sparks -are said to have been perceived in atly observation, I have ge nerally on that account omitted to note the variable quan titiesof difirergency ill the pitll balls. Their utluost l;tnit of regular divergency seerns to be about five or near sis inclles; above that they are unsteady xand disorderly. l'he pith l:alls are near two-te-nths of an inch fin diameter, suspended by very fine flaxell nthreads (in the state it is ill fronl the heckle) five inches longe When I mention the distance of the balls in t-etlths of an inch, it is to be understood as llearly so as my eye can determitze. Thisfapparatus reqiliresa constant attention especially relating to Atmospherical Electricity. 229 during a disturbed state of the atmosphere. From the room in which the apparatus is placed I am seldom absent one hour, excepting the time of sleep; but, when I leave it, the last thing I do at night is to examine the state of the electricity, and, if I find the rod unelectrified, I then place the Leyden bottle on the table S, with its knob nearly in contact with the ball N. The next morning, if I find this bottle charged, I write the kind of electricity it is charged with against the day in the journal, and add, by the night bottle. It is presumed, that the table is sufficiently obvious. The two columns for positive and negative electricity are used only for the first observation of each day. I use FAHRENHEIT'S thermometer, suspended on the north outside of a bow-window. The time of making the observation with it, and the barometer, and also of the direction of the wind, has usually been nine o'clock in the morning. Lastly, it may be useful to observe, that I have always found, when the rod is highly electrified, the lower though uninsulated part of the apparatus (viz. the metallic connection of the bell P with the moist earth) to be in a contrary state of electricity to the upper and insulated part. See the 20th of May. Having made a memorandum of the several thunder-storms which have happened in divers parts of this island, according to information by letters, and from newspapers, I thought it useful to insert them in this journal, in order to show whether some contemporaneous appearances in my apparatus might not be attributed to them.

At five o'clock the rain fell more copiously, and it was strongly charged with negative electricity. Early this morning I found the humidity of the air electrified negatively. At ten o'clock, the electricity became more intense, so as to emit small sparks: in half an hour's time there were four beautiful gradu;ll changes of electricity. Afterwards the rod remained negative two hours. Three o'clock P.M. the electricity changed, and continued near three hours positive.

For ^then it is considereda that in the preceding year there were 73 days in which wweal signs only of the electric fluid were observed; that seven days were destitute of electric signs; and that that kind of weather in ^thich very weak signs of atmospherical electricity could be obtailled, is now found, by-a more sensible electrometer tharl was at that time used, to be always positwly electrified, it will, I presume, relatzng to Strnospherzcal EleGtICit. 2$5 diminish the apparent dlsproportion. Anal as fbr tl-le relllainillg diSerellce, I also attribute a good deal of it to t]Ae accuracy vf rny prewnt mode of obtailaing atmospherical electricity with a more complete apparatus; by which I have been able to collect the electric fluid, in suicient quantity to ascertain the kind wllich predominates in the atmosphere, even in its weakest state. I 11ave tllerefbres founcl it an easy matter to fix the kind of electricity that the aqueous vapours in the air were charged with in each day throughout the year. Frotn repeated observations, and long experience I am perfectly satisfied that the aqueous vapours, suspended ill the air are constalltly electrified; requiring OIlly the aid of a proper collector, to render the effects of their electricity at all times sensible. And for this reason, there mfay be justly said to be, an electrical atmosphere within our aerial atmosphere. During a courw of moderate weather, the electricity of the atmosphere is invariably positive; and exhibits a flux and reflux, svhich generally causes it to increase and decreaw twice irl every twenty-four 11ours. rlthe moments of its greatest force are about two or three hours afker the rising, and some titne before alld after the setting, of the sun; those when it is weakest, are fkom mid-day to about fc)ur oclock. The periodical electricity of the atmosphere seems to be manifestly influenced by 2?eat and cold. Hence it plainly appears, why we always find warm small rain to be but weakly electrified; when cold raill, which falls in large drops, is the tnost intensely electriEed of any The abovementioned eighth day of MaJr, colllpletes my second years journal; which, agreeable to my promikse, I have now the honour of pressenting to the Royal SocietyX with a L1 e 236Mr READ>S Meteorological yournal, &c.description of tlle iuproved atlnospheric apparatus, which has been used for the foregoing observations.
