[ 69 3 V. On the Calculus of Sympbols, with Applications to the Theory of JDifferential Equations. By W. H. Lo RUSSELL, EsLq., A.B. 0Communicated by ARTHUR CAYLEY, Esq., F.B.S. Received December 20, 1860,-Read January 24, 1861. THFE calculus of generating functions, discovered by LAPLACE,was, as is well known, highly instrumental in calling the attention of mathematicians to the analogy which exists between differentials and powers. This analogy was perceived at length to involve an essential identity, and several analysts devoted themselves to the improvement of the new methods of calculation which were thus called into existence. For -a long time the modes of combination assumed to exist between different classes of symbols were those of ordinary algebra; and this sufficed for investigations respecting functions of differential coefficients and constants, and consequently for the integration of linear differential equations, with constant coefficients. The laws of combination of ordinary algebraical symbols may be divided into the commutative and distributive laws; and the number of symbols in the higher branches of mathematics, which are commutative with respect to one another, is very small. It became then necessary to invent an algebra of non-commutative symbols. This important step was effected by Professor BOOLE, for certain class6s of symbols, in his well-known and beautiful memoir published in the Transactions of this Society for the year 1844, and the object of the paper which I have now the honour to lay before the Society is to perfect and develope the methods there employed. For this purpose I have constructed systems of multiplication and division for functions of non-commutative symbols, subject to the same laws of combination as those assumed in Professor BOOLE'S memoir, and I thus arrive at equations of great utility in the integration of linear differential equations with variable coefficients, I then proceed to develope certain general theorems, which will, I hope, be found interesting. I have applied the methods of multiplication, as just explained, to deduce theorems for non-commutative symbols analogous to the binomial and multinomial theorems of ordinary algebra. Lastly, I have shown how to employ the equations deduced in the earlier part of this paper in the integration of linear differential equations. I have, for this purpose, made use of methods closely resembling the method of divisors which has so long been used in resolving ordinary algebraical equations. The whole paper will, I hope, be found to be a step upwards in the important subject of which it treats. I shall just observe, that the symbolical combinations used in this paper may also be applied to the calculus of finite differences, as may be seen in Professor BOOLE'S memoir. ID1CCCLX. IF 70 MR. W.

We shall suppose throughout this paper that d eX iz-t~v ' Let P, Q, and R be three functions of (7r) and (s), such that PQ acting on any subject is equivalent to R acting on the same subject, or PQ=R. We shall say that P externally multiplies Q, and is an external factor of R. In like manner we shall say that Q internally multiplies P, and is an internal factor of R. We shall also say that R is externally divisible by P, internally by Q. We easily see the truth of the following symbolical equations depending on the laws of combination assumed above.

The symbolical form of this equation is 3ru+ +2(3e3?+.r_ 1)u+ 3g(Q3+1) + Z( 1.)U =X TIhe divisor of 0r' is xr only, the divisors of ?(5r2-1) are zr-1, Ir, xr+l; hence putting 'l( )=T7, 4/ortr-1, we find the criterion of the symbolical quantity e1(7X) + Q(9) to become 5.(r21) l)3{(7r-1)'+1} + { 3@'r-2)8+(9r-2)--1 }-(?r-3)3=0, an identical equation. Hence gr+ (7-1) is an internal factor of 3T3 +g2(3Z3+ZI)+3e(,X3+1)+V(,2-1); and the equation may be written, effecting the internal division, {2(Z _ 1)2 +?(-7+1)(2?-7-3)+5T(5r+1)j(?,r+(,r 1))u=Xx or if +( -)=t1, The only divisor of (7r-1)2 iS 7-1, the divisors of 7(r+1) are 7r and 7r+1; and by trial it is found that the divisor g(71)+ (7r+1) satisfies the criterion, and is therefore an internal factor. Hence, effecting the internal division, (e(Qr-2) +7r)((71) + (7+1))ul =Xxl and the differential equation becomes (?(7r-2)+7r)(g(r -1)+(7r+))(e%-+(V-J))U=XX or {tX+) )7-2x}{G(x2+x)W-(x-1)}{(&2+)a --1} u=Xx.

In case this method does not succeed we may sometimes resolve the symbolical function into factors by assuming u=(7+a)v and proceeding as before, determining (oe) from the criterion, as will be shown in the following examples: To integrate the differential equation 2( + 1)3L u+(4X3+11 2+10 +3) +2x3+10x2+5x 3=X. $($ ) U2+$ $ f)W $+ S S The symbolical form of the equation is {a2+ 3+f2)+g2(3Ta 2+ 8Ir+10)+(3 2+ PIX+5) +0 2+2-3X.

Let 41(7)=7r+2, 40(7)=sr+{, then the criterion of ?(Qr+2)+(zr+E) become (X2?2x-.3)Qsr+t)+? (3X2 +?+1)(T+ 1) + (7r + ) (7r 1) (3Z2 4?r+6)(r+E-2) (7r + ?) (7r + 1-1) (7r + I -(X2-3,r+2)(sr+E-3)= ? Put Z=0 to determine A) and we have E=0 as one value of &, which on trial is found to satisfy the proposed. Hence (,x+2)+'r is an internal factor of the symbolical function 3zr(zr+1)(,x+2)+?2(3Z3 + 8Wr2 + 10 X) +g(3X3+ 7X2+5?)+?(?1-1)(,r+3). Wherefore, effecting the internal division, the equation becomes (g2r +g(2,x+ 3) + z+ 3)(T--1)(g( + 2) + z)vX, whence performing the inverse calculations, we have v(X (X +)Jd( +l1)5w9 d ,1+jl'd(X+?) l ) d x.x 2X where the arbitrary constants; must be reduced to two. Next consider the differential equation (x4+2x+a'x2) d -6(x2+x) d-+6(x+2)u=X; the symbolical form of this equation is 27 1 + 2g -l )(7r-3)u+(z-3)(z-r -4)u=X. Let u==(zr+a)v, and the equation becomes 2 g27r(7r-1)(7r+E)v+ 2g(7r 1)(7r3)(7r+E)v+(r-3)(=-4)(v+i)v=X. Let 4,(X7r) =7 -1, 90(Xr) = r-3, and the criterion becomes. (or3)(7r-4)(7r+E)32(r-2)(7r-4)j(7r+-1) + (7-2) (7r-3))(7r+9-2)=0. Putting 7r 0 in this equation, we have E=0, and this value renders the above equation identical, & . (r) +(ir-3r ) 82 MR. W. H. L. RUSSELL ON THE CALCULUS OF SYMBOLS. is an internal factor of the symbolical function ?'72(=_ 1)+2gn(7r1)(7r-3)+7.(7r 3)(z-_ 4); wherefore, effecting the internal division, the equation becomes {g(7r-1)2+7(7r-4} {g(7r-1)+(r3)}m=X. This equation may be written { ( 2)@r3)(-4)}(f+1){(X ) (?(; 1)+ 3))-X, in which the inverse calculations are all practicable. As a final example we take the differential equation d2ud ( 5+4x4+5x83+2x2) + (2x4+3X3+5X2_ 6X)-+( +1)YU=X. The symbolical form of this equation is 3r+(7r+1)u+e(47r2-r+ l)z+g(57_r2_57r+2)u +(r-1)(27r-. 1) X. If we put ut-rv, the equation becomes (g+1)(71)(g(T-1)+ 7r)(gr +(2,x1))v= X, in which the inverse calculations necessary for the solution of the equation are all practicable. In cases where the assumption u'=(=+E)v does not lead to the solution of the equation, we may assume u=(7r + 1)(Xr+2)v, and proceed as before. We may also treat linear differential equations by ascertaining the condition that 4A1(fr+4+0(g) may be an internal factor of this symbolical expression, .(g9) -7n+P '(g)7r" 1+ &c. + P,(g)7r + P?(g). I have shown how this is to be effected when n=2 or 3. For higher degrees the investigation would be very laborious. In all cases in which the second member of the differential equation is zero, this internal factor, supposing it to exist, would conduct us to a particular integral.
