An Observation of some Parelii seen at Canterbury. By Mr. Stephen Gray. FEbruary the 26th, 1691/~. being Sunday, about half an Hour after Three in the Afternoon, chancing to look out of a Window that faced South-East, I saw not far from the South to the Westward, an Appearance of somewhat not much unlike the Sun, when seen through Clouds, viz. with its Periphery not exactly defined, from which it likewise differed, in that one half of it was coloured deep Red and Yellow, the other White. I went immediately into the Garden, taking a Theodolite with me, in order to take its distance from the Sun, which the room would not permit; but was then presented with an Appearance exactly like the former, but on the opposite side of the Sun; I took the distance of this from the Sun, which was 23 degrees to the Westward; but before I could take the distance of the Eastern one, it Vanished, but soon after Re-appear'd, and then I perceived manifestly, that they were both situate in the extremities of a Semicircle (127) circle, whose Center was the Sun, passing betwixt it and the Zenith. This Appearance continued about half an Hour. Des Cartes in his Book of Meteor, calls such Phenomena Parhelia, or Mock Suns, and gives us the History of Five seen at Rome, in the year 1629. March the 20th, and Demonstrates, that there may sometimes, according to the Laws of Refraction and Reflection, appear Six at one time, viz. Five mock Suns, and the true one. I chanced to be at home alone, and saw no Body to whom I could impart what I saw, till after the MockSuns vanished, nor do I hear of any, but my self, that saw them; yet may you be certain, that I have not deceived my self or you.
