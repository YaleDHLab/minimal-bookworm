Flamsteed. Math. Reg.&F.of the R.S. giving the description& uses of an Instrument for finding the distances of ~s Satellits from his Axis, with the help of the Table of Parallaxes and Catalogue of Eclipses; printed in the preceding Transactions. See Tab. 2. Fig. 2. T H E little Circle in the middle represents the Planet Jupiter, the four concentrick Circles the proper Orbits of his four Satellits, duly proportioned to the breadth of his body; the distances betwixt the parallel lines intersecting them, being each equall to one of his Semidiameters. The 4 divided Circles next without these, are distinguished into so many parts as there are days and hours in each Satellits revolution; the Innermost of them serving for the first, or innermost Satellit; that next it, for the 2d, that next without this for the 3d, and the outermost for the 4th; above which is a small divided Arch of 15 degrees. By this with the aforementioned tables to find the distances of the Satellits from ~s Axis to a proposed time. 1. In the Table of Parallaxes of the Orb, find the the Parallax to the time proposed, and note whether it be to be Added or Substracted. 2. Extend the thrid from the center of the Instrument over the Parallax numbred in the small Arch: it cuts off in the 4 divided Circles, so many hours as each Satellit spends in passing from the Axis of the shadow to the Axis of ~ viewed from our Earth; these I call the Simple Parallactick Intervalls, which if the Parallax was to be added, are also additionall, if to be Substracted, Subductive. 3. To these Parallactick Intervalls add the times of half the duration of the Eclips of each Satellit, which for the 1st.may be assumed 1h.10~,for the 2d.1h. 30~. greater [1263] greater exactness being needless; but for the 3d, and 4th, when Eclipsed, (their Immersions into the shadow and emersion from it being commonly given in the Catalogue) take half the difference of these times at the next Eclipse to the time proposed, for the half duration, and add them to the Simple Parallactick Intervalls, so have you them Augmented. But note that this year 1686, and so often as the 4th Satellit is not Eclipsed, (which is two years in every six) its Intervall needs no augmentation, the Catalogue shewing the very time when it passes the Axis of the shadow. 4. Find in the Catalogue the times of the Eclipses of each Satellit next preceding the time proposed, and when the 4th is not Eclipsed, of its passing the Axis of the shadow, to which, if the Parallactick Intervalls augmented were Additionall, add them to, if Subductive, Substract them from, each the time of its proper Satellits Eclipse, so have you very near the Apparent times, when each Satellit last past over the Axis of ~ viewed from our Earth. 5. Subtract each of the times thus got from the time proposed: the Remainders are the Intervalls of the Motion of each Satellit from ~s Axis. 6. Extend the thred from the Center over each of these Intervalls of Motion numbered severally in the divided Circles belonging each to its proper Satellit, where it cuts the proper Orbit of that Satellit, whose intervall was numbered in its peculiar Circle, it shews amongst the parallells, how many semidiameters of ~ that Satellit is distant from him, and on which side of him tis posited. Note further, that the thred as it lay extended over theparallax of theOrb numbered in the small Arch,where it cut the several proper Orbits of each Satellit, shew'd amongst the Parallells, how many Semidiameters of ~ the center of the shadow was distant from the center V v v of [1264] of ~ viewed from our Earth. And that if the Parallax of the Orb were additionall, the shadow lies on the right hand from ~, if Subductive, on the left. To explain these precepts, I shall give two brief examples. Let it be then proposed to know how far each Satellit appears distant from ~ on the 26th of December this present year 1685, at 16h. 52~. p, m. when the 3d Satellit falls into the Shadow; also on July the 16. 1686. at 10h. 00~. p. m. when there is no Eclipse.

And the Satellits stand at the two proposed times as in the two Figures. In drawing of which, tho' I have considered their Latitudes from the line of their utmost Elongations passing through ~ center, yet I give no rules for determining it, the contrivances and directions necessary on that account, being too many and troublesome to be inserted here: my design is only to shew the Ingenuous observer, how to find at what distance from ~, each Satellit appears, that so he may not mistake one for another when he is to observe any of their Eclipses. But thus much I shall advise him, That from the beginning of the year 1686. for 3 years following, the Satellits, in the upper or remoter Semi-Circles of their Orbits from us, have South Latitude from the line of their utmost Elongations, passing over ~ center; in the under or nearer North, but continually decreasing till the end of 3 years, when they change for the contrary. That the Latitude of the 4th Satellit is never more then 1~ Semidiameter of ~, of the 3d little more then half as much, of the two innermost still less. And that towards the end of the year, the 4th Satellit (which will then have passed uneclipsed near two years) will begin to fall into the Penumbra again, for which reason he may doe well to attend its transits at its first appearing, least perhaps it be really Eclipsed.
