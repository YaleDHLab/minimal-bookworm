(237) II. The Longitude of Carthagena in America. By the same. HAving lately, by the Favour of Sir Hans Sloane, received a Packet of Observations from Cartagene in America, made by Colonel Don Juan de Herrera, Chief Engineer of that City, I find among them one Immersion of the first Satellite of Jupiter into his Shadow, observed there by a Telescope of 17 <inferred>1/2</inferred> Feet, on April 9. Stilo vet. 1722. at 15 h. 58~ 44~ apparent Time; and two Emersions of the same, viz. July 5. 11 h. 23~ 41~ and July 21. 9 h. 42~ 17~ Stil~ vet. all which tally with Observations made at Wansted, by the Reverend Dr. Pound and Mr. Bradley, who observed there the very next Eclipses to all the three; that is to say, the Immersion by a fifteen Foot Tube, on April 11. 15 h. 28~ 40~ Temp. aequ. or 15 h. 30~ 25~ Temp. app. And the first Emersion, July 7. 10 h. 59~ 28~ Temp. aeq. by the Reflecter, and 18~ after, or 10 h. 59~ 46~ by the 15 foot Glass, that is, 10 h. 54~ 12~ apparent Time. The other was observed at Wansted. July 23. 9 h. 19~ 10~ Temp. aeq. both by the Reflecter and 15 foot Glass; that is to say, at 9 h. 13~ 35~ apparent Time. Substract from each of these one Period of this Satellite, or 1 d. 18 h. 28~ 36~ and April 9. 15 h. 58~ 44~ at Cartagene will be 21 h. 1~ 49~ of the same Day at Wansted, and the difference of Meridians 5 h. 3~ 5~. Likewise by the first Emersion, July 5. 11 h. 23~ 41~ at Cartagene was at Wansted 16 h. 25~ 36~ of that Day, whence the Difference of Meridians 5 h. 1~ 55~. But by the last EQ mersion, (238) mersion, July 21. 9 h. 42~ 17~ at Cartagene was 14 h. 44~ 59~ at Wansted; whence Wansted is 5 h. 2~ 42~ more easterly than Cartagene: and taking the Medium of all three, 5 h. 2~ 34~ or 75~ 38~ may be taken for the true difference of Longitude, that is, 75 1/2 from London, which compared with Capt. Candler~s Observation of the late Lunar Eclipse, shews Cartagene to be about 20 Leagues to the Eastwards of Port Royal in Jamaica.
