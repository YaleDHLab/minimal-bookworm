[561 ] XXIV. On TsCHIRNHAUSEN S Transformation. By ARTHUR CAYLEY, Esq., F.1.S. Received November 7,-Read December 5, 1861. THE memoir of M. IIERMITE, "Sur quelques thdoremes d'algebre et la resolution de 1'equation du quatrieme degre," * contains a very important theorem in relation to TSCHIRNHAUSEN's Transformation of an equation f(x) = 0 into another of the same degree in y, by means of the substitution ,=px, where ox is a rational and integral function of x. In fact, considering for greater simplicity a quartic equation, (a, b, c, d, e' sx 1)4 =0, M. HERMITE gives to the equation y= px the following form, y=aT+(ax+b)B+(ax2+4bx+6c)C+(ax3+4bx2+6cx+4d)D (I write B, C, D in the place of his To, T1, T2), and he shows that the transformed equation in y has the following property: viz., every function of the coefficients which, expressed as a function of a, b, c, d, e, T, B, C, D, does not contain T, is an invariant, that is, an invariant of the two quantics (a, b, c, d, e(X, Y)4, (B, C, D),Y, -X)2. This comes to saying that if T be so determined that in the equation for y the coefficient of the second term (y3) shall vanish, the other coefficients will be invariants; or if, in the function of y which is equated to zero, we consider y as an absolute constant, the function of Y will be an invariant of the two quantics. It is easy to find the value of T; this is in fact given by the equation O=aT+3bB+3cC+dD; and we have thence for the value of y, y= (ax+b)B+(ax2+ 4b+ 3c)C +(ax3 + 4bX2+ 6cx+ 3d)D; so that for this value of y the function of y which equated to zero gives the transformed equation will be an invariant of the two quantics. It is proper to notice that in the last-mentioned expression for y, all the coefficients except those of the term in a?, or bB+3cC+3dD, are those of the binomial (1, 1)4, whereas the excepted coefficients are those of the binomial (1, 1)3; this suffices to show what the expression for y is in the general case. I have in the two papers, "Note sur la Transformation de TsCHIRNHAUSEN," j and "Deuxieme Note sur la Transformation de TSCHIRNHAUSEN,"t obtained the transformed* Comptes Rendus, t. xlvi. p. 061 (1858). t CaLsL, t. lviii. pp. 259 and 263 (1861).4G2 562 MR.

DAVIS and OTTER, under my superintendence, of the transformed equation for the quintic equation. The several results are given in the present memoir; and for greater completeness, I reproduce the demonstration which I have given in the former of the above-mentioned two Notes, of the general property, that the function of y is an invariant. At the end of the memoir I consider the problem of the reduction of the general quintic equation to Mr. JERRARD'S form X+ +ax +b=O. Considering for simplicity the foregoing two equations (a, b, c, d, eat, 1) = 0, y-(ax+b)B+(aX2+ 4bx+ 3c)C+(ax3+4bX2+6ex+ 3d)D; let the second of these be represented by y=V, the transformed equation in Y is (Y VI) (Y*2) (Y V3) (Y -V4) = 095 where V1, V2, V3, 4 are what V becomes upon substituting therein for x the roots a<, X2, x83, xv4 of the quartic equation respectively. Considering y as a constant, the conditions to be satisfied in order that the function in v may be an invariant are that this function shall be reduced to zero by each of the two operators dab+2bY3e+bd+ 4de--(Dbc +2CN), 46ba+r3&bj+ 2dac+Cad -(2CaD+FBC): These conditions will be satisfied if each of the factors y-V1, &c. has the property in question; that is, if y-.V, or (what is the same thing) if V, supposing that x denotes therein a root of the quartic equation, is reduced to zero by each of the two operators. Considering the first operator, which for shortness I represent by A-(D3c 2CNB), in order to obtain AV we require the value of Ax. To find it, operating with A on the quartic equation, we have (a, 6, c, d(X, J)3AX+(a, 6, c, daXI 1)3=0O or Ax= 1. In AV, the part which depends on the variation of Ax then is --aB+(2axc-4b)C+(3aV2_ 8bx6c)D, and the other part of AV is at once found to be +aB+(4acx+6b)C+(4ax2+12bx+9c)D; whence, adding, AV= 2(ax+6b)C+(aX2+ 46x+ 3c)D, and this is precisely equal to (Dac+2Ck)V; so that V is reduced to zero by the operator A-(D~c+2C3B). MR. A. CAYLEY ON TSCHIRNIIAUSEN'S TRANSFORMATION. 563 Similarly, if the second operator is represented by V-(2CbD+Bbc), then we have (a, b, el djX, 1)3VX+X(b, c: d, e:(x<, 1)3=O, which by means of the equation (a, bl el d, e(Xx, 1)4-=0 is reduced to VX=X2. Hence in VV the part depending on the variation of x is ax2B + (2ax + 4bx')C + (3aX4 +b8x+ 66cX2 )D, and the other part of VY is at once found to be (4bx+ 3c)B+(4bX2+12cx+ 6d)C+(46x'+12cx2+t2dx+ 3e)D; and, adding, the coefficient of D vanishes on account of the quartic equation, and we have VV=(ax+ 4bx+ 3c)B+2(C? + 46X2+ Ccx+ 3d)C, which is precisely equal to (2C)D+Bbc)V, so that V is reduced to zero by the operator V-(2C3D+B3c), which completes the demonstration; and the demonstration in the general case is precisely similar. In the case of the cubic equation we have (,b, G. d2'Xx, 1)3= 0 y-(av +b)B+(a,2+,3x+2c)C; and writing the second equation in the form (y-bB--2cC)+x( -aB-3bC)+x2( -aC)=O, multiplying by x and reducing by the cubic equation, we have dC +x(y-bB+ cC)+X2( aB) O, and repeating the process, dB +x( 3cB+ dC)+X2(y+2bB+cC)=O; or, what is the same thing, we have the system of equations ( gy-6B-2cC, aB-3C, .-aC K1, x, X2)=0, dB dC, ybB+ cC, -a B dB , 3cB+ dC, y+2bB4cC and the resulting equation in & is of course that formed by equating to zero the determinant formed out of the matrix in this equation.

The coefficients l, Mr and therefore the function in y, are invariants of the two forms, (a, b5 c5 d(XX, Y)31 (it CjYj --X) ; or in the present case, where there are only two coefficients B, C, the coefficients C1, fl and therefore also the function in y, are covariants of the single form (a, b, c, d(B, C)3, considering therein (B, C) as the facients. It may be remarked that in the present case, assuming the invariance of the function in y, we may obtain the transformed equation in a very simple manner by writing in the first instance C=O, this gives (a, b, c, doex 1)3=0~ y=(ax+b)B, and thence a) b, G. d:(y-bB, aB)3=0; or developing, y3f+ 3y(ac b2)B2+ (a2d3abc? 2b3)B30 where the expressions for the coefficients are to be completed by the consideration that these coefficients are covariants of the form (a, b, c, djB, C)3. But it is only in the case in hand of a cubic equation that the transformed equation can be obtained in this manner. In the case of a quartic equation, we have (a, b, c, d, e(ic, 1),=0, .y=(ax+b)B+(ax2+4bx+ 3c)C+(aX3+ 4b2+ 6cx+ 3d)D, and these give the system o~f equations MR. A.

HERMITE'S. There should, I think, be an identical equation of the form JU'2_-IU'21H'+4H13+M?' 12which would serve to express the square of the invariant (V in terms of the other invariants U', H', 0', I, J; but assuming that such an equation exists, the form of the factor M remains to be ascertained. The invariant J (cubinvariant) of the form (1, 0, A, d, Em y, 1)4 contains 12, and it would be necessary to make use of the identical equation just referred to in order to reduce it to its simplest form; and (this being so) I have not sought for the expression of the cubinvariant of (1, 0, O(, D, C7y, 1)4.

The ten divisions were separately calculated. It is to be noticed that these divisions other than 4 and 6 correspond to each other in pairs, while each of the divisions 4 and 6 corresponds to itself, as thus: Div. 1, -10 2, 9 3, 7 5, -8 4, 4 6, -6, viz. if in the place of Y; a, b, cl d, elf; B, C, D, E, we write y; f, e, d, c, b, a; E, D, C, B, then division 1 becomes division 10 with its sign reversed, and so for divisions 2 and 9, 3 and 7, 5 and 8; while each of the divisions 4 and 6 is unaltered, except that the sign is reversed. But the corresponding divisions were each of them calculated, and the property in question was used as a verification. Another very convenient verification, which was employed for the several divisions, was obtained by putting a-b6 = c= d= e=f=B= C=D=E= 1, upon which supposition the dcterminant becomes MR. A.

The following is an exemplification: the terms in y which involve the product BCDE are obtained by the collection of the corresponding terms in the ten divisions, as follows: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 &/BCDE.5 a2y2 + 1I22+ 1+ 122 + I2+ I1 + 30 abef + 4911620 + 425 +50202516 + 49 + 980 aedf + 801+200 +184 148 +100 +184 +100 +200 + so -280 ace2+ 80 . + 80440 -180 ad2e -60 -6060 -280 b2df . . -440 . +80 . + 80 -825 62e2 . -825 -180 b6Of . 60 . -60 + c740 Wde | + 740 ~e3 C22 + 1750=0 4+2104+1224+182 -12281+ 76 +48+1821+ 76+122 +210_+1I 411 2 570 MR. A. CAYLEY ON TSCGIRNHAUSEN'S TRANSFORMATION. where it may be remarked that the greater part, but not all, of the component coefficients are divisible by 5. I soon observed in the process of summing the ten divisions that all the resulting coefficients should be divisible by 5 (the only exception is as to the terms in y? which contain B5, C5, D5, and E' respectively), and the circumstance that they are so in each particular instance is as far as it goes a verification, which, however, only applies to those of the component coefficients which are not themselves divisible by 5. But it was known za priori (I will presently show how this is so) that the sum of the resulting coefficients should be equal to zero, and that they are so in fact is a verification as to all the coefficients. The foregoing specimen term BCDE is one which remains unaltered when B, C, D, E are changed into E, D, C, B; and on making the further change a, b, c, d, ef iiitof, e, d, c, b, a, the coefficient of BCDE remains, as it should do, unaltered; this is a verification of the coefficients of the terms ace2, h'df; ad2e, bc2f which are respectively interchanged by the substitution in question, but not of the other terms af2', abef, acdf, b2e2, bedf, which are respectively unaltered by the substitution. I did not employ what would have been another convenient verification of the several divisions, viz. the comparison of their values on putting therein a=b= cd=e-f-1, with the corresponding values as calculated independently from the determinant y-B-4C-GD-E, B-5C-1OD-1OE, C5D-IOE, E, yB-4C6D+ E, B5C-lOD D X 5D+ E, yB4C+ 4D+ E, C 5C+ D lOC+ 5D+ E B , 5B+ C 10l+ 5C+ D D-5E, -E C5D D B5C , -C yB+ 6C+4D+ E, B IOB+IOC+5D+ E, y+4B+6C+4D+E The calculation of the ten divisions of this determinant would however itself have been a work of some labour. The last-mentioned determinant is =y5; in fact, equating it to zero, we have the transformed equation corresponding to the system of equations (l~ l~ 1 l1 1lI(xj l)5=01 y=(x++)B+(X2+ 5x+4)C+(x3+5x'+10x+6)D+(X4+5X3+10X+I0X+4)E. But the first of these equations is (x+1)5-0, and the second is y= (x+l){B+(x+4)C+(x2+ 4x+6)D+(x'+4. +6x+4)E}, so that for each of the five equal roots x= -1, we have y= 0, or the transformed equation in ~y is yi'=O. MR. A. CAYLEY ON TSCHIRNHIAUSEN'S TRANSFORMATION. 571 And since upon writing ab = c=d=ef= the transformed equation becomes Y-=0 it is clear that in the coefficient of any monomial product of B, C, D, E,. the. sum of the numerical coefficients of the several monomial products of a, b,. c, d e, f must be 0, which is the property above referred to as affording a verification of the calculated expression of the transformed equation.

In fact we have *(s=2(Tab. No. 15), 5 =2(Tab. No. 18), = (Tab. No. 13)'(Tab. No. 14) -3(Tab. No. 15)2, JfF= (Tab. No. 13)2(Tab. No. 17)-2(Tab. No. 15)(Tab. No. 18), where the Tables referred to are those of my Fifth Memoir on Quantics, Tab. No. 13 being the quintic itself. This is a further verification of the foregoing result. I will conclude by showing how the formula may be applied to the reduction of the general quintic equation to Mr. JERRARD'S form x5 + aX+b= O. It was long ago remarked by Professor SYLVESTER that TSCHIRNHAUSEN's Transformation, in its original form, gave the means of effecting this reduction. In fact, if the transforming equation be then the equation in y is of the form (go S3, ;, Di A}, Whys 1) 5=0 where Y, d, X, C, ,JF are, in regard to a, 3, y, 6, e, of the degrees 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 respectively. And by assuming, say a a linear function of /3, ry, ), we may make B-O0, and we have then C, 13, 0, .IF functions of the degrees 2, 3, 4, 5 respectively of the quantities A/ r' a) s and these can be determined by means of a quadric equation and a cubic equation in such rianner that ;=, 0, D 0, in which case the equation in y will be of the required form. For considering 3 r, to s as the coordinates of a point in space, the equations C= 0, = 0 will be the equations of a quadric surface and a cubic surface respectively, and if /, ry, I, s be the coordinates of a point on the curve of intersection, the required conditions will be satisfied. And by combining with the equation of this the quadric surface, the equation of any tangent plane thereto (or by the different process which is made use of in the sequel), we may, by means of a quadric equation, find, a generating line of the quadric surface, and then, by means of a cubic equation, a point of intersection of this line with the cubic surface, i. e. a point the coordinates whereof give the required values /3, ', I, s. And similarly for the new form of TSCHIRNHIAUSEN'S Transformation; the only difference being that, starting with an equation in y which contains the four arbitrary quantities B, C, D, E, we obtain in the first instance an equation (1, 0, C, X1, C, Jfiy, 1)5=0 wanting the second term. And then B, C, D, E are to be so determined that C=0, i= 0. To proceed with the reduction, I write the foregoing value of d in the form 5-C=( 4ac-462, Gad6bc , -4ae4bd , afbe )(B,C,DE)2, 6ad6bc, 4ae+20bd-24c2, af+l1be-16cd, 4bf-4ce 4ae -4bd, af+15be -16cd, 4bf+20ce-24d2, 6cf6de afbe, 4 4ce , Aef 6de , 4df-U4e2 MDcccTAxH. 41I 576 MR.

CAYLEY ON TSCHIRNIAUSEN'S TRANSFORMATION. which for shortness may be represented by a, h, g, 1 XBC, D, E2), hi b, f, m g, f, c, n 1,m, n, p or say 2 ;(fl(B, C, D, E).2 Now, by a formula in my memoir "On the Automorphic Linear Transformation of a Bipartite Quadric Function* ," if T denote any skew symmetric matrix of the order 4, then if (B, 0,13, E)=( (D-.T)(Q+T)-'(B', C', D'5 E'), in which formula fi-1, A2-T, (S2+T)-', Q are all matrices which are to be compounded together into a single matrix, we have identically (QB5 , 0,1D, E)2=(f1:XB', C', 13, B')2. Let Q denote the determinant I 2+ T , then the terms of the matrix (2+T ') are respectively divided by Q, and we may write (f+T)-'Q( +T)1 where Q(f2+T)-l is the matrix obtained from the matrix (fl+T)-' by multiplying each term by Q, the terms of Q(O1+T)-1 being thus rational and integral functions of the terms of the matrix (A2+T). Hence if, instead of the before-mentioned relation between (B, C, D, E) and (B', C', D', E'), we assume (B, C, 1, E)=(D'(S-T)Q(f+T),XB' C, D', EB'), we find (Qfl:B, C, D, E)2=Q2(n2(B', C', D1', E')2. And if the matrix T is such that we have Q=O, i. e. Det. (P+T)=0 (which is a quadric relation between the terms of the skew matrix, that is, each term -is contained therein in the first and second powers only), then the equation becomes (nK(B, C, D, E)2= 0. It is clear that this can only be the case in consequence of the coefficients of transformation in the equation (B, C, D, E)=(f21(f2-T)Q(2+T)-y1&2TB' C', D3' E') being such that there shall exist at least two linear relations between the quantities (B, C, 1, E), and I assume (without stopping to prove it) that they are such that the number of such linear relations is in fact two. That is, the last-mentioned equation establishes between the quantities (B, 0, D, E) two linear relations, in virtue whereof* Philosophical Transactions, vol. cxviii. (1858), see p. 44.MR. A. CAYLEY ON TSCIRNAUSEN'S TRANSFORMATION. 577 C-0. And this being so, we may, without loss of generality, write D'=O E'= 0, or put (B, C, D, E)=(i2-1(f--T)Q(f2+T)-'DUB', C', 0 0); so that B, C, D, E are linear functions of B', C', such that (t=0. And then substituting these values for (B, C, D, E), we find a cubic function of B', C'; so that, putting 3=0, we have a cubic equation to determine the ratio B': C'. The foregoing reasoning presents no real difficulty, but it is expressed by means of a very condensed notation, and it may be proper to illustrate it by the case of the quadric function a2+y2+z2. Considering the equations sq|=(~~~~~~X +x-xp) 2+ _+V2)yf + (vSz My-~~ (+ Y)x + (1 2 2_2y+ 2(py -9Z' z= 2(YX-p)x'+ 2(pPv+k)y'+(l -X 2+v2)z', these equations, if the expressions for x, y, z had been divided by 1+X2+p2+V2, would have given x2 +y2 + z2 _2 +y'2 +z12. Hence they actually do give X2++y2+z2=(1 +X2+p42+v2)2(X'2+yI2+z'2); or if I +X2+p2+v2=0, they give 2-+y2 + z2= 0. But if 1 +?2+p2+y2=0, then 1+x2-p2-v2: 2(Xjp) : r so that we have X : z=l+X2_p2_p2 2(Xp+v): 2(:x-), which is the same result as would have been found by writing Y/=z'=O, and which comes to saying that x, y, z are not independent, but are connected by two linear relations.

There is no loss of generality in putting all but two of the quantities (x, A, v, V, o, r) equal to zero; in fact this leaves in the formulae a single arbitrary quantity, which is the right number, since the ratios B: C: D: E have to satisfy only the two conditions 1;=0, g3=0. ADDITION, Nov. 10, 1862. I take the opportunity of remarking, with reference to my memoir " On a New Auxiliary Equation in the Theory of Equations of the Fifth Order*," that I recently discovered that the auxiliary equation there considered is in fact due to JACOBI, who, in his paper, "C Observatiunculke ad theoriam aequationum pertinentes j," under the heading "Observatio de mequatione sexti gradus ad quam amquationes quinti gradus revocari possunt," gives the theory, and observes that the equation is of the form 06+a2o. 4+a4 02+a6= 32V a EJ and mentions that the value of a2 is easily found to be (I adapt his notation to the denumerate form (a, b, c, d, e, f v, 1)5=0) =40ae-16bd+6o2 (this ought, however, to be divided by -2), but that the values of a4, a6 " paullo ampliores calculos poscunt." The value of the coefficient in question is correctly obtained (page 270 of my memoir) in the form 2 +2(-16ae+4bd---C2) +12ae; but the reduced value is given in two places (page 271) as equal to -32 ae, this should be -20 ae, + 8 bd, ,, + 8 6d, 3c2, ,, 302. The last-mentioned correct value was used in obtaining the coefficient for the standard formn, which coefficient is given correctiy, page 274.* Philosophical Transactions, vol. cli.
