A Letter from Gowin Knight, M. B. to the President; concerning the Poles of Magnets being variously placed. London, April 3. 1745. Honoured Sir, T H E favourable Reception which those magnetical Experiments met with, which you lately did me the Honour to communicate to your Learned Society, (see Tr. No 474. p. 161.) incourages me to hope, that the following Facts are remarkable enough to merit their Attention. Read April 4. 1745. 1. I cut a Piece of natural Loadstone into the Shape of a Parallelopiped, 1 Inch 8/10 in Length, in Breadth [362] Breadth 4/10 of an Inch, and 2/10 in Thickness: Its Weight was 3 Drams and 10 Grains. In this Stone I placed the magnetical Virtue, in such a Manner that the two opposite Ends became, both of them, South Poles; and the Middle was, quite round, a North Pole. 2. Another Stone was in Length 1 Inch 1/10, in Breadth 7/10, and in Thickness about 2/10 at a Medium, it being thicker at one End than at the other: Its Weight 1 Dram 57 Grains. The 2 opposite Ends of this Stone I made both North Poles, and the 2 opposite Sides South Poles. 3. An irregular Stone, that weigh'd about 5 Ounces and a half, had 2 broad flat Surfaces opposite to each other, at the Distance of 1 Inch and 3/10. I made half of each of these Surfaces a North Pole, and the other half a South Pole; so that the North Pole of one Surface was opposite to the South Pole of the other Surface, and vice versa. 4. I took a Stone of a pretty good Kind, that had a Grain very apparent, running the lengthways of it: It was 1 Inch 4/10 in Length, 1 Inch 3/10 in Breadth, and its Thickness at the Sides was 6/10 of an Inch; but in the Middle 7/10; it being tapered away from the Middle to the Sides: Its Weight was 3 Ounces wanting 4 Grains. At one End of it I placed a North Pole surrounded by a South; and at the other End a South surrounded by a North Pole; so that the Edges of each Surface had a Pole of a different Denomination from that which occupied the Middle. A great many Varieties of this kind might be easily devised; but these Examples seem sufficient to shew how 3 [363] how manageable the magnetic Virtue is in respect to its Direction; and how defective most of the Hypotheses are, which have been raised to account for the Phaenomena of the Loadstone. Your obedient humble Servant, Gowin Knight. IV.
