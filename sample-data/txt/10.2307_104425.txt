[50] VI. A Rupture of the Navel, communicated to the R O Y A L S O C I E T Y by H. W. Taube, (Dove) Surgeon of the Pearl Man of War. ANN Stubbensfull had a very hard Labour 17 Years before her Death, and a little Rupture appeared in her Navel, and in the next Labour it increased; which she endeavoured to cure by a Bandage, but in vain; so it continued to increase more and more. Read May 24. 1744. The first time I was called to her, was upon account of a Wound at Lett. d. where it looked as if it would mortify; which I cured, but left a Place open as big as Half a Crown, from which a great Quantity of Water would sometimes run out; but getting Cold, it stopped; and the whole Saccus was very much inflamed (This Wound was formerly made by uneasy Trusses). I called on the late Mr. Amiand; who told me, he had seen in a Work-house a Rupture of the same Kind, but not so big. She had once an Obstructio alvi for fifteen Days; and nothing would do, till I order'd her a Glyster of Tobacco boil'd with Urine. The late Dr. James Douglass saw her; and he and I agreed to open her after her Death; to which she consented. At last, she died maniacal. Dr. Douglass and I would have open'd her; but the Obstinacy of her Children was so great, that they would not agree to it till the fourth Day after her Death, which happened in July, when the Putrefaction was so great, that Dr. Douglass, nor I, nor any body else, could remain by her; and so were obliged, to our great Sorrows, to desist.
