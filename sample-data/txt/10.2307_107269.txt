345 J XX. On the Attractions of homogeneous Ellipsoids. By James Ivory, A. AM Communicated by Henry Broughamn, Esq. Fd R. S. Read June a,, 180g. 1. THE theory of the figures of the planets involves in it two distinct researches In the first of these, it is required to determine the Jforce with which a body, of a given figureand density, would attract a particle of matter, occupying any pro. posed situation: in the second, the subject of investigation is the figure itself, which a mass of matter, wholly or partly fluid, would assume, by the joint effect of the mutual attraction of its particles, and a centrifugal force arising from a rotatory motion about an axis. To render the second of these inquiries more exactly conformable to what actually takes place in nature, the influence of the attractions of the several bodies, that compose the planetary system, ought to be superadded to the forces already mentioned. It is the first of these two researches, of which we propose to treat at present; and we shall even confine our attentions to homogeneous bodies, bounded by finite surfaces of the se. cond order. The theory of the attractions of spherical bodies is delivered by Sir ISAAC NEWTON in the first book of the Principia,* In the same place the illustrious author lays down a method for' F Sect. I Z. S46 Mr. IVoRY on the Attractions determining the attractions of round bodies (or such as are generated by the revolving of a curve about a right line which remains fixed) wh en the attracted point is situated in the coinmon axis of the circular sections :* and he emnploys this method to compute the attractive force of a spheroid of revolution on a point placed in the axis.t MACLAURIN was the first who determined the attractions of such a spheroid gemerally, for any point placed in the surface, or within the solid. The method of investigation, invented by that excellent geometer, is synthetical, but original, simple, and elegant, and has always been admired by mathematicians. When the attracted point is placed without the solid, the difficulty of solving the problemI is greatly increased; and it, was reserved for LE GENDRE to complete the theory of attractions of spheroids of revolue. tion, by extending to all points,, whether without or within the solid, what had before been investigated for the latter case only.. LA PLACE took a more enlarged view of the problem; he extended his researches to all elliptical spheroids, or such solids whose three principal sections are all ellipses; and he obtained conclusions with regard to them, similar to what MACLAURIN and LE GENDRE had before demonstrated of spheroids of revolution. In this miore general view of the problem, the investigation is particularly difficult, wvhen the attracted point is placed without the solid. The method of investigation, which LA PLAcE ,has employed for surmounting the difficulties of this last case, although it is entitled to every praise for Its ingenuity, and the mathematical skrill which it displays, is certainly neither so simple nor so direct, as to* Sect. x-, Prop. 91. I Prop. i, Car. 2. 1 Acad. aes Scie'ces de Paris, Savants LEtrangers, Tom. X. of homogezeois .EJs$&zds ,347 leave no room for perfecting the theory of the attractions of ellipsoids in both these respects. It consists in shewing that the expressions for the attractions of an ellipsoid, on any external point, nmay be resolved into two factors; of which, one is the mass of the ellipsoid, and the other involves only the eccentricities of the solid and the co-ordinates of the attracted point: whence it follows, that two ellipsoids, which have the same excentriciities, and their principal sections in the same planes, will attract the same external point with forces proportional to the masses of the solids. This theorem includes the extreme case, when the surface of one of the solids passes through the attracted point: and by this means the attraction of an ellipsoid, upon a point placed without it, is made to depend upon the attraction which another ellipsoid, having the same excentricities as the former, exerts upon a point placed in the surface.* LE GENDRE has given a direct demonstration of the theorem of LA PLACE, by integrating the fluxional expressions of the attractive forces; a work of no small difficulty, and which is not accomplished without complicated calculations.t In the Mecaq Ce &leste, the subject of attractions of ellipsoids is treated by LA PLACE after the method first given by himself in the Memoirs of the Academy of Sciences , founded on the theory of series and partial fluxions. It was in the study of LA PLACE'S work, that the method I am about to deliver, was suggested; and it will not be altogether unworthy of the notice of the Royal Society, if it contribute to simplify a branch of physical astronomy of great difficulty, and which has so much engaged the attention of the most eminent mathematicians.* cad. des Sciences, de Paris pour I78S3 f Ibid. i8 t For F7g3 348 MAr.

Let a, b, c, be three co-ordinates that determine the pox sition of a point attracted by a solid: and let dM denote a molecule, or element of the mass of tihe solid, whose position is fixed by the co-ordinates x, y, Z, respectively parallel to a, b, c: then, supposing the invariable density to be denoted by unity, if we putf {(-)+ ( b y ) + (c _Z) }I the distance of the molecule from the attracted point, the di-o rect attraction of the molecule on the point will be This force of attraction is next to be decomposed into other forces, having fixed directions independent on the position of the attracting molecule; and the directions most naturally suggested for this purpose, are the three axes respectively parale lel to the co-ordinates.

In like manner, if B and C be integrated; the first with respect to the variable y, and the second with respect to the variable z; two new expressions of these attractions will be obtained, exactly similar to the expression for A, that has just been investigated. ,3. The general equation of a surface of the second order bounding a finite solid, is* ir + kFz + kiF z if the three quantities k, k', k" be supposed to be all equal, thene the solid will be a sphere ; if two of them, as k' and k" be equal, it will be a solid of revolution; and if all the three be unequal, it will be an ellipsoid, or a spheroid, having all its three principal sections ellipses. In what follows, we shall always sup-. pose that k is the least of the three quantities k, k', k", or the least of the semi-axes of the solid. The general equation of the ellipsoid, will be satisfied by putting x k cos. A, y ksin. p cos. 4, and z = k" sin. p sin. 4; where e and 4' denote two indeterminate angles. In order to substitute these values of x, y, and z in the formula (2), we must begin with taking the fluxion of y, on the sup,@ Mecan. Cclstc, Tom.

To obtain a further transformation of the last expression of A, we are now to determine the semi-axes of an ellipsoid, whose surface -shall pass through the attracted point, and which shall have the same excentricities, and its principal sections in the same planes, as the given ellipsoid. Let h, h', h" be the semi-axes required: then, because the attracted point is to be in the surface of the solid, h h+ 0~ and, because the excentricities must be equal to those of the given ellipsoid, therefore hX _ ht = k/Z e', and h"'_k"' -.k 2= e`: hence -t + Z7j + = 1 Yz b C b h+ e' nan equation which now contains only one unknown quantity, Z z 2 ,552 Mr. IvoRY on -the Attractions namely, 1. It is plain that one value of h, and only one, may, in all cases, be determined from this equation. For, by taking h small enough, the function on the left hand side will become greater than any positive quantity how great soever; and by taking h great enough, the same function will become less than any positive quantity how small soever: and while h increases from o, ad lijinitumr, the function continually decreases from being infinitely great to be infinitely little. Therefore there is only one ellipsoid, having the required conditions, whose surface will pass through the attracted point,* When h is determined, then h' = Vha + e', h" ./hB + e'l: and in consequence of the equation, ae bX cS bz Y ;J hl/z we may suppose, a h cos. mn b = h' sin. m cos. n, h" sin. m sin. n.

P cos. p . dp . d4 for its base, and its length equlal to 2,h cos. ; then, it is a aco'nsequtece of what has been shown above, that A and a' will likewise express the distances of the point, having a', b', c' for its co-ordina-es from the extremities of this last prism,. Th-erefore, if we put A'= hth1,J ill . q Cos. .d}P . ldQ;^,, then will A' (when the double fluent is taken between the same limits as in the case of A) be equal to the attractive force which the ellipsoid of homogeneous matter, whose semi-axes are A, h', h", exerts on the point, whose co-ordinates are k cos. M, k' sin. m cos. n, k" sin. m sin. n, or a', b', c', in the direction parallel to the axis h. For, in the formula for A, as the fluxion under the sign of double integration, denotes the attractive force of an indefinitely small prism of the matter of the ellipsoid, whose semi-axes are k, k', k" upon the point whose co-ordinates are a, b, c, in the direction parallel to k and h; So, for the like reasons, in the formula for A', the fluxion under the same sIign, will denote the attractive force of an indefinitely small prism of the matter of the ellipsoid, whose semi-axes are h, hi', h", upon the point whose co-ordinates are a', b', c': and therefore the two fluents, when extended to all the prisms that compose the ellipsoids, will denote the attractions of the whole masses upon the respective points, in the direction mentioned. Thus the attractions A and A' depend upon the same fluent, and they are manifestly in the same proportion as k' k" is to h' h". And if we denote by B' and Cl the attractive forces which the ellipsoid of homogeneous matter, whose semi-axes are ie hi, h" exerts on the point whose co-ordinates are a', b', c', in o1 homogeneous E1I4soids. 355 the directions parallel to k' and k"t; it may, in like manner, be shewn, that the attractions B and B' have the sarne proportion as kk" has to hh" and the attractions C and C', the same pros portion as kk' to hA'. The points in the surlfaces of the two ellipsoids, which aredetermined by the co-ordinates, h cos. m, h' sin. mn cos. n, hA' sin. m sin. n, or a, b, c, and k cos. m, k' sin. m cos. ni, k" sin. n; sin. n, or at, b', c', may not improperly be called corresponding points of the surfaces: they are such points as are situated on the same sides of the planes of the principal sections, and have their co-ordinat es respectively proportional to the axes to which they are parallel. This being premised, the result of the foregoing investigation may be enunciated, as in the following theorem: "If two ellipsoids of the same homogeneous matter have ' the same excentricities, and their principal sections in the same planes,; the attractions which one of the ellipsoids ex."erts upon a point in the surface of the other, perpendicularly to the planes of the principal sections, will be to the attract. "tions which the second ellipsoid exerts upon the correspond"ing point, in the surface of the first, perpendicularly to the samne planes, in the direct proportion of the surfaces, or "areas, of the principal sections to which the attractions are "perpendicular."PP For the principal sections, being ellipses, their areas arec proportional to the products of the semi-axes. When the attracted point, of which the co-ordinates are a, b, c. is placed without the ellipsoid having k, k', k" for its semiaxes ; then the point, of which a', b', c' are the co-ordinates, Is, necessarily within the other ellipsoid: and, on account of the: IAI Mr. Ivory on the Attractions relation which has been s1rewn to take place between the at.. tractions of the two solids upon corresponding points in one another's surfaces, the case, when the attracted point is placed without an ellipsoid is made to depend upon the case, when the attracted point is within the surface. 4. Let us now consider the formula ( 2) for the attractive ofrce parallel to the axis k, ,on the supposition that the attracted point ig within the ellip*. Soid. If a = o (that is, if the attracted point be in the plane of y. and z) then 0,, _ o, for all values of x,y, and z: and, in this case, the whole attractive force A is evanescent, as it ought to be. For all other values of a, the expression in the circumstances supposed, is plainly a finite po-. sitive quantity: and, therefore, supposing b and c to be constant and a to increase, we must infer that the attractive force A will receive finite increments, so long as the point determnined by the co-ordinates a, b6 c, is within the ellipsoid. If this point be in the surface, then the variable ordinates x,y, z, when they belong to points indefinitely near to the attracted point, will approach indefinitely to an equality with a, b, c; and the corresponding values of go-A, and, consequently, the fiuxions of the forcce A, will become infinitely great ; on which account the continuity of the function A is broken off. From what has now been observed, it follows, that we may substitute for the force A, its expansion in a series of the powers of a, provided we are careful not to extend the conclusions obtained by reasoning from the nature of such series, of homogeneous EI/psoids.

Now, the expansion of the force A cannot contain any of the powers of a excepting those which enter into the series for , I,: therefore, supposing the expansion of A to be arranged according to the powers of a, it will necessarily be of this form., viz.

It is remarkable, that the last expression of A(') does not contain either of the quantities b or c; for these do not enterinto the function M: and hence we are to conclude that the value of A(l) is independent on these co-ordinates, and is the same for all points situated within the same principal section of the ellipsoid. Another inference is, that all the other coeGticients A(3) A) &c. of the expansion of the force A are severally equal to o, as is plain from the law which connects those quantities with one another, and with All): on this ace count the expansion alluded to will be reduced to its first term,. and we shall have, simply, t A() x a. he same ccn'siderations likewise suggest a new analytical expression of A(') I; which, on account of its sitmfplicity, and its imn ediate dependence on the figure and equation of the solid, seems to deserve the preference to every other: for, since it has been shewn that the value of A(I) is independent on the co-ordinates b anid c, we may exterminate these quantities from the formula (4k) and thus S(I)frJJ 2X. dy. d tlL=JJ{X + YZ + z the fluent to be extended to the whole of thre surface of the principal section made by the plane of y and z.

When the attracted point is without the ellipsoid, it becomes necessary, in the first place, to determine the seni-axes of another ellipsoid whose surface shall pass through the attracted point, and which shall have the same excentricities and its principal sections in the same planes, as the given ellipsoid:. the1se semi-axes have been denoted by h, h', h", and the formulas for computing them have already been given,. We must next determine the co-ordinates of the point in the surface of the given ellipsoid, that corresponds to the attracted point in the surface of the other ellipsoid: and, according to the definition that has been given of them, these co-ordinates, denoted by a', b', c' are thus found; a' -aX k; b = b x A, ; VI' ' = C X .t These things being determined, the attractions of the ellipsoid whose semi-axes are h, h', hi, upon the point whose * Pages 35i and 35z. t Page 355. of homogeneous Ellbysoids. 8G3 co-ordinates are a', ', c' (which is plainly within the solid) are as follows: k 2X r. dy' . dz' A'= a x xJJT?--+I } t / + y/2 + ;ZZ-; 3 r k'f f 'dx'. d' ,= C X hi/ d .

If we examine the expressions (5) for the attractions of an ellipsoid upon a point placed within the surface, it will readily appear that the coefficients, into which the co-ordinates of the attracted point are mnultiplied, are homogeneous functions of o dimensions of the semi-axes of the solid, these quantities rising to the same dimensions in the numerators of the functions, as in the denominators: and herLce it is easy to infer, that the values of these coefficients depend only on the proportions of the semi-axes to one another, and not at all upon their' absolute magnitudes. Therefore, if we conceive two ellipsoids of the same homogeneous matter, similar to Je6+ llMr. IvoRY on the Attractions one another and simil'arly placed, whose surfaces envelop the same attracted point ; it is plain, from what has just been remarked, that the attractions of thiese elipA soids up-on the point will be precisely equal. Thus it appears, that the rnatter in closed betwveen the surfaces of the tw'o solids oeS not alter the a-ttractive force of the inlner ellipsoid ; wkl.-lich cCould inot b ti -h case, unless the attraction of tune suiperadded rv tatter in. any one direction were precisely qequal to the attraction of the samna matter in, thecontrary direction, so asto produce an equilib-rium. of opposing forces. Hence xwe .may extend to a shell of hon iogeneous matter, bounded by any finite surfaces of the second order, which are sirmilar to one another and sir iarly p1'aced, what Sir ISAAC NEWTON has demonstrated in the like hypothesis for surfaces of revolution ;* as in the following theorem: "If a point be situated within a shell of homogeneous matt r, bonndled by two finite surfaces of the second order, hvich. are Similar and similarly placed; then the attraction "'of the matter of the shell upon the point, in any one direction, will be equal to, and destroy, the attraction of the same matter, i tihe opposite direction." 6. Nothing more is wanting to complete a theory of the attractions of homogeneous ellipsoids, than to integrate the fluxional expressions (5) already obtained.

These three forces compose a force, directed to the centre of the sphere, and equal to (x V2 + I _ c2 it is therefore 3 directly proportional to the distance from the center. For a poin t without the surface of a spher'e, we have h ' h1I Va'a + 62 4-c2: hence it is easy to infer, tiat the formulas (6) wvill become, 4<7 3 a X M A-a Y-t> (t +p bz + fcz) -(az + bP + c`)$ h 3aX A = a x L V + c'(3a2 + bV+ c) C = C X +__-_+ -Ca + z +CZN (a-'+ b72 +c) where M -.k3 the mass of the sphere. These three 3 forces comjpose a force directed to the center: MDCCCIX. 3 B 3G6 _Mr. IVoRY On the Ad'rachonis this force is, therefore, directly as the mass, and inversely as the square of the distance from the center of the sphere. For an ellipsoid in general, we have x = k cos. q,y = k' sin.

For this purpose, let t-he fluxion of y be taken, making P the only variable, so that dy -Ak' cos. p cos. 4 x dp: then, becausey must be constant inthe expression of the force A, when z varies, we must make dz-k"cos.p sin.4a .aP+k"sin. p cos.4.d> o = ' cos. p cos. , . d-q ' sin. p sin. 4,. di, and, by exterminating dp, we get dz = " so" , x d4: therefore dy . dz = k'k" cos. q sin. q . dp . d. Again, because the value of x depends only on the angle ?, we lhave dx = k sin. p . dp: and, by taking the fluxions of y and z relatively to the variable t4, we have dy, =-k' sin. o sin. 4,. d4, dz k" sin. p cos. 4 . d: thlerefore, dx . dy=kk' sin. sin.4, .d p . d dx. dz = kk" sin. cos.4,. dp . dJ: in these expressions the sign -, which stands before the values of dx and dy, has been neglected: for that sign marks only that x and y decrease when the angles p and 4 increase, and does not affect the absolute magnitudes of the fluents, which are alone thesubjects of our research.

In the general case of the problem, the expressions that have been obtained transcend the limits of the ordinary analysis; and their integration requires the introduction of otliwr quantities besides algebraic expressions and circular arcs and logarithms. They belong to the class of elliptical transcendants a branch of the mathematics vhich has been of homogeneous Elipsoids. 3G very succes sfully cultivated and is fertile in resources and .methods that are applicable to every particular instance. The fluents in the formulas (6) for a point without the surface, are derived from the ellipsoid whose semi-axes are h, A', h" in the same manner as the fluents already considered kk'k' are derived from the gven ellipsoid:. and, because is equal to the mass of the latter solid, divided by tIe mass of the former one, it is easy to infer that we have only to substitute A for k in the flui..nts of the formulas (7), to obtain the express sions of the attractions of the given ellipsoid uponi a point without the surface. Thus the two cases, whet the attracted point is withln the solid or in the surface, and when it is without the solid, difier only in the limits of the fluents: in the former case, the fluents, beginning when the variable quantity is infinitely great, are to be extended till it has decreased, so as to be equal to the least of the semi-axes of the given ellipsoid; and, in the latter case, the fluents are to be exi tended only till the variable quantity has decreased, so as to be equal to h, the least of the semi-axes of the ellipsoid, whose surface passes through the attracted point. In the frmer case, the values of the fluents are the same for all points within the ellipsoid, and in its surface ;, in the latter case, these values depend upon the position of the attracted point. The preceding formulas, being founded on themost general hypothesis, are applicable to all figures bounded by finite surfaces of the second order., The case of the sphere, which corresponds to the supposition that the excentricities e' and el' are both evanescent, has already been considered, and, as it s attended with no difficulty, it needs not be again discussed; 870 Mr. IvoRY on the Attractions but the two cases; of solids of revolution, that of the ablate and oblong spheroids, are deserving of particular attention. In the oblate spheroid, the two greater semi-axes k' and kI are equal to one another; and, therefore, it corresponds to the supposition of c = e2-. In this case the formulas (7) will become A,=3aM.Jff2e(z ) B =bM J -C gcasM M f [kT2~ these expressions may be all integrated by the ordinary methods, and thus we get A=3aM . { ac tn B= 3bM farc. tan. t a LT 3~~~~Mr e~~~~ x iarc tan. ro luti only ~ to omut h arth seiaxi of reouinokh peod The formulas express the attractions of an 6blate spheroiu upot a point within the surfacerior in it, acting parallel to a. bs cthco-ordinates of, that poin;t, of which a i's parallt h axis of revolution. When~ thle attracted -poi-nt is %without the surface,, we have only to compute 6h, the semi-Taxis O'frevzolution of thle spheroidl, whose surface passes through the attracted point, anld to sub. stitute "it for k in the last formulas, in ordter to have the expressions of the attractions sought: and it is to be remarked that the equation for finding h, which in the general case of the of homogeneous Ellfissoids. 371 ellipsoid rises to the third degree, is, in this case, dcepressed to a quadratic.

In the oblong spheroid, one of the semi-axes k' and k" must be made equal to the least semi-axis k, which corresponds to the suppposition of e'2-o. In this case, the formulas (7) will become A -aM .d B = 3bM . f jk(1 + ez)?C =3cM f dkel In these exp)ressions k is the radius of the equatorial circle of the spheroid, and not the semi-axis of revolution, which is Vk2 + e2: and if we change k to denote the semiCaxis of revolution, which requires that Vlk e' be substituted for k; and, for the sake of uniformity with the formulas for the oblate spheroid, likewise interchange a and b, and A and B, in or(ler that a mnay denote the ordinate parallel to the axis of revolution, and that A mnay express the attractive force in the inae direction ; thenr, the last expressions will become A =3aM .

When the attracted point is without the spheroid, wve must first compute h, the semi-axis of revolution of the spheroid, whose surface passes through the attracted point and for this purpose we have the following expression, ViZ. 2h= 2a' + 62 + C e2 + + Ci +e )observing that a is the ordinate parallel to h then the attractioans required will be found merely by substituting h for k in the formulas for the case when the attracted point is within the spheroid.
