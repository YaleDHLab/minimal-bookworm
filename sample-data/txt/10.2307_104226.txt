[627] XIV. Part of a Letter from M. Geoffroy, F. R. S. and Member of the Royal Academy of Sciences at Paris, to Sir Hans Sloane, Bart. late President of the R O Y A L S O C I E T Y, concerning a Child of a monstrous Size. NOrmandy has furnished us some Years ago a Child, monstrous by its Size, and a Strength which its Age could not naturally afford. It was born at Rouan, and is a Prodigy of Virility, of Three Years and Two Months of Age, perhaps One Month older, and is now in the Hospital at Rouan. It has a very large Neck, the Breast very broad, and the Belly bigger than in its natural State. The upper Part of the Thighs is a little thickish, the rest is conformable to its Age. He has Hair only about the Privy Parts; the Penis is Three Inches long when there is no Erection, but of Six when there is any. They have found him to have Emissions. The Fact is very true, and M. Le Cat, F. R. S. a Surgeon at Rouan, has fully traced it out. XV. Two Read Dec. 22. 1743.
