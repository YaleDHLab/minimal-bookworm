Pensans, Sept. 22. 1700. S I R, I Have met with no Birds or Fish, since our coming hither, that I suspect for undescribed: Only two or three Stellae, and some other Exanguia marina have occur'd, which I have not seen before on our British Goasts. We have also met with the Capillus Veneris verus in abundance on the Sea Clifts about St. Ives. 2. Dr. Sherard's Scrophularia Scorodoniae folio. 3. Blattaria lutea; an luten minor Park?
