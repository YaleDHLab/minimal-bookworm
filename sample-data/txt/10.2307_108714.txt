E 743 ] XXVIII. SUpplement to Kr. MACQUORN RANKINE'S Paper " On the Thermodynamic Theory of Steam-engines with dry saturated Steam, and its application to practices." Received September 3,-Read December 8, 1859. THE following additional information respecting the steam-ships referred to in the examples may be interesting, although it does not strictly belong to the special subject of the paper. EXAMPLE I.-Paddle-steamer 'Admiral,' built by Mr. JAMES R. NAPIER; engines made by Messrs. RANDOLPH, ELDER and Co.; draught 7 feet 6 inches; length 210 feet; breadth 32 feet; displacement 820 tons; speed with 774 indicated horse-power 11 9 nautical miles an hour. Effective work in driving the ship, about 604 horse-power. Available heat expended per hour in foot-pounds per indicated horse-power, 1,980,000 1,980,000 1 005000 efficiency of steam 0123 Coal burned per indicated horse-power per hour, 2-97 lbs. Available heat of combustion of one pound of coal, 162,1000700 =5,420,000 foot-lbs. The total heat of combustion of one pound of the coal employed being roughly estimated at 10,000,000 foot-pounds, it appears that the efficiency of the furnace and boiler was about 0-542. The boilers were improved marine boilers of ordinary proportions. EXAMPLE II.-Screw-steamer ' Thetis,' built by Messrs. C. SCOTT and Co.; the engine made by Messrs. ROWAN and Co. Available heat expended per hour in foot-lbs. per indicated horse-power, 1,7980.,000 1_,980,000 =10325. efficiency of0 team= 0 192 -0,312,500. Coal burned per indicated horse-power per hour, during an experiment of one hour's duration, 1'02 lb. Available heat of combustion of one pound of the coal employed, 10312'500 =10,110,000 foot-pounds. The coal used was of very good quality; and its total heat of combustion per pound is* Philosophical Transactions, Part I. 1859, p. 177; Proceedings of the Royal Society, January 1859. 744 MR. MACQUORN RANKINE ON STEAM-ENGINES. estimated at 11,560,000 foot-pounds. Hence the efficiency of the furnace and boiler was ,1 10,000 088 11,560,000 In this case the short duration of the experiment on the consumption of coal, which was interrupted by a fog, makes the result less satisfactory than it would have been if the experiment had been continued, as intended, for several hours. The engine and boiler were of a kind invented some years ago by Mr. CRADDOCK; the boiler consisting chiefly of a sort of cage of vertical water-tubes enclosing each fire-grate. The heating surface was about nine times as great, relatively to the fuel burned, as it is in ordinary marine boilers. EXAMPLE III.-Paddle-steamer ' Callao,' built by Messrs. JOHN REID and Co.; the engines by Messrs. RANDOLPH, ELDER and Co.; displacement 1100 tons; speed with 1176 indicated horse-power 12-05 nautical miles per hour. Available heat expended per hour in foot-pounds per indicated horse-power, 1.,980,~000 1l,980,000 =4130' otls efficiency of steam 0*14 -14,143,000 foot-lbs. Coal burned per indicated horse-power per hour, 2 67 lbs. Available heat of combustion of 1 lb. of coal, 143143,000 =5,300,000; 2-67 being nearly the same as in Example I. The boilers in this case were, like those in Case I., improved marine boilers of ordinary proportions. In such boilers, 5,400,000 foot-lbs. may be considered a fair estimate of the available heat of combustion of good ordinary steam-coal.
