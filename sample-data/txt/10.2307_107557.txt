L 196 XV. On the Errors in Longitude as determined by Chronometers at Sea. arising from the atlion of the iron in the ships upon the Chronometers. By GEORGE FISHER, Esq. Comnnunicated by JOHN BARROW, Esq. F. R. S. Read June 8, 182.o THE determination of the longitude at sea by timekeepers, is so exceedingly easy fron the simplicity of the observations and calculations employed, and fro n the general practical bility of the method, as to render chronometers in the pre. sent improved state of navigation, almost indispensable articles in the equipment of ships for foreign service; and I shall feel happy-if the following observations may, in any way, contribute to the more accurate determination of the longitude by this method. The sudden alteration in the rates of chronometers when taken on board of ships, has been frequently observed by intelligent seamen ; and is generally ascribed to the motion of the vessels. Before, however, I attempt to account for this alteration, I shall first prove that it actually takes place; and, in order to do this, shall relate the circumstances connected with the chronometers on board the Dorothea and Trent, commanded by Captain BuCHAN, which occurred during the late voyage to the North Pole. Soon after the arrival of the ships on the coast of Spitzbergen, the chronometers on board the Dorotheea (five in number) were found to be rapidly gaining on their former Mr. FIsHER on the errors in longitude, &c. 197 rates as determined in London previous to the ship's sailing; in consequence of which the land appeared considerably to the westward of its true position as determined by lunar observation, and they were found to be still gaining daily, which appeared not only from each subsequent set of lunars, bu't also by comparing the longitude of different points of land determined by the chronometers, with the longitude of the samie points ascertained in the same way some time afterwards. For instance; the longitude of a remarkable point of land on the northwest coast of Spitzbergen, called Cloven fCli was found by a mean of the observations taken with the chronometers on June 2 i,.1818, to be 10t 35' 27 E; but the longitude of the same point of land on July a1, was 1o015' 87" E, making a difference of no less than about 20' of longitude in five weeks; that is, estimating the longitude with the same rates and errors as determined in London before their departure from this, therefore, it appears, they had been gaining on their former rates or had been 'increasing their gaining rates, and diminishing their losing ones. An opportunity soon afterwards occurred of observing the effect produced upon the chronometers by removing them on shore. On the 9th of August, the chronometers, nine in number, were landed on an island, where a temporary ob-. servatory had been erected for the purpose, and the latitude of which had been accurately determined with a repeating circle made by TROUGHTON, when it was found that the acceleration immediately ceased ; for the longitude of the place by chronometers, August 1x, was 9O 42' 36" E, but on the 27th, it was o00 1 o" E, making a difference of i8' 24" of longitude in fifteen days, using the former rates. Since, therefore, the chronometers were getting easterly MDCCCXX. D d 198 Mr. FIsHER on the errors in longitude by their removal on shore, the acceleration must have ceased ; which will appear upon consideration. 'A similar circumstance was observed by Lieut. FRANKLIN to 'take place with the chronometers on board the Trent which were four in number; and he observes "It may be "worthy of remark, that the chronometers taken out by the Hon. Captain PHIPPS, showed too great westerly longitude, "and consequently gained on these seas. The fact of so "many chronometers altering their rates the same way, -is Xcurious, but I am not aware that any cause can be ask CC signed." The effect produced upon one or two of the chronometers by their removal to land, was very remarkable; a chronometer made by BAlRD was (by observations taken on shore near where the ships lay at anchor, byr Lieutenants FRANKLIN and BEECHEY, with false horizon, and eight inch reflecting circles of TROUGHTON, from August 8, A.M. to ic, P.M.) losing -3.1 daily when on board; but upon its removal on shore to the observatory, its rate per transit, from August i6, to 26, was observed by myself to be 18,`2 losing Upon again removing it on board, it was found by obserP vation, as before, to be losing 6,"x daily; from which it appears the chronometer lost no less than about thirteen or fourteen seconds daily by its removal on shore.' Another chronometer in the Trent, made byPENNINGTON, had been gaining rapidly on board ; when taken on shore, it acquired immediately a losingrate of i ,"8, nearly the same as it had in London before the vessels sailed. A chronometer of my own, by ARNOLD, was affected like. wise nearly as much, losing about g' daily by its removal on shore. as determined by chronometers at sea. r9 -In the other chronometers the alteration was less sudden, but was ultimately not less considerable; and they were several days on shore before they acquired a steady rate, as will appear by the following table of their rates, during the interval of the respective dates.

In the others the effect was almost immediate. The clock and chronometers were likewise landed upon a small island in Fair Haven, on the north coast of Spitzlergen, on the both June; and as the same circumstances occurred, it will be needless to detail them. The following table is intended to show the difference 900 Mr. FISHER on the errors in longitude between the rates on board the ships and what they would have been had they been on shore. time.

The errors of the -chronometers in April, were those obtained in London before the ships sailed; those on the 25th August were determined at the Observatory on Dane's Island, Spitzbergen, the longitude of which was determined by a great many observations of the distances of the sun and moon for several days with TRouGHTON's eight inch sextants and reflecting circles. The rates in the column entitled " Mean Rates at Sea," are deduced by dividing the difference of the errors by the interval. The rates in the column entitled " Mean Rates on Shore," or more properly what they would have had, are means between the rates of chronometers on shore before leaving England, and those obtained at Spitzbergen.; and although a mean between the rates of chronometers obtained at different times, may not accurately be the mean rate they would have had during the interval of those times, front the continued variation to which they are subject; yet, upon comparing the two last columns together, of the rates thus deduced, it will be perceived that in all the chronometers their gaining rates had either been increased, or their losing ones diminished on ship-board, or in other words, they had all been accelerated. Nor is this acceleration peculiar to high latitudes; it was observed very soon after the chronometers were put on board in the Itiver, particularly in Nos. 3 and 8, which, upon arriving at Shetland, were found to have gained instead of losing rates, which they had in London. This acceleration was very soon perceptible in the chronometers taken out by the Hon. Captain PmPPs, made by a0e Mr. FIsHER on the errors inz longitude KENDAL and ARNOLD. Mr. LYONS, who accompanied him, landed at Sheerness Fort, and found the longitiid' by them to be s3 'o" E, which is about 13' W of the true longitude, as determined in the Trigonometrical Survey. The same occurrence took place last summer ( 1819). The longitude of a place in one of the Orkney Islands, as deter. mined by three chronometers made by ARNOLD, tWO of them belonging to myself, the other to Lieut. E. HOME, R. N. who accompanied me, was 6' 40" W. of the longitude determined by the difference of M of stars E and W of ). Again, in the trial of Mr. HARRISON'S timekeeper, in 1764, the longitude of Barbadoes by the watch was 10' 45" Imore to the westward than that determined by astronomical observations made by the persons sent out for that purpose. Soon after this trial, the commissioners of longitude agreed with Mr. KENDAL, one of the watchmakers appointed by them to receive Mr. HARRISON's discoveries, to make another watch on the same construction, which went considerably better than Mr. HARRISON's. Mr. KENDAL'S watch was sent out with Captain CooK in his second voyage towards the South Pole and round the world, in the years 1772-3-4 and a, when the only fault found in the watch was, that its rate of "going was continually accelerated." It now remains, therefore, to determine what this accele. ration arises from. That it does not arise from the motion of the vessels, is evident in the case of the nine chronometers on board the Dorothea and Trent ; since the acceleration was observed when the ships were firmly beset with ice; also in the case of the alteration in the rates of the chronometers upon as determined by chronometers at sea. 903 landing, and taking them on board again at Dane's Island, the ships were riding at anchor close in shore without any perceptible motionx An account was also kept on board and on shore, of the state of the temperature and barometer, every two hours, both night and day and upon comparing them together, there does not appear to be the least correspondence between the change of rates and the temperature at the time. It appears therefore to me, that this acceleration arose entirely from the magnetic action exerted by the iron in the ship on the inner rim of the balance, which is made of steel. That the iron in the ships becomes magnetic, is plain, from the polarity which exists in it; the whole forming altogether one large magnet, having its south pole on deck nearly amidships, and its north pole below. This is seen from the constant deviation of the north end of the compasses placed on deck towards the centre of the ship, as appears from recent observations, which I have mentioned elsewhere. Nor is it surprising that the force exerted by the ship's iron (thujbecome magnetical) on the balance of the chrom. nometers, should be sufficient to cause a very sensible altera. tion in the rate of going, when we consider how easily, in other cases, the presence of any thing magnetical is detected by the alteration of the rate of a chronometer; and when we consider the great influenceexerted by this iron upon the binnacle compasses at very considerable distances, and in situations where the utmost precaution is used to remove every piece of iron from them, by using copper-bolts, fast tenings, &c. It remains only to determine, how far this alteration in the 204 Mr. FISHER on the errors in longitude rates of the chronometers, can be reconciled with that ob-e served in chronometers when under the influence of magnets placed in different positions with respect to their balances. To determine this, two watches were used, with steel balances and horizontal escapements, one by EARNSHAW, the other by ALLAN and CAITHNESS; also two chronometers made by ARNOLD. To each of these watches were applied, at a distance of two inches from the balance, magnets of twelve inches in length, in four different positions, and in the planes of the balances. The following Table will show the rates of the watches in twenty-four hours, deduced by comparing them with an excellent clock with GRAHAM'S dead beat escapement, and regulated by transit. I No. .

No. 2, gained with both poles in every position. Nos S and 4 gained in every position but two ; and the quantities lost in the positions were far exceeded by the accelerations' caused by the opposite poles, excepting one case in that of No, 4. 'The magnets were likewise placed in different positions out of the planes of the balances the results were very similar to those above, but differing in quantity, according to the distance of the magnets from the planes of the balances. Upon placing the magnets very near to the rim of the balances, a very rapid acceleration took place with both poles, and in every position of the magnets, particularly in the watches Nos. I and 2. Upon too near an approach of the magnets, the watch No. i, and chronometer No. 3, were rendered useless; the former, when the magnets were taken away, gaining no less than about 1X hour, and the chronometer losing about so" in ?4 hours; and in again repeating the experiments in the plane of the balances, the rates of the chronometers (without the magnets) were so variable, that it was necessary to determine their rates before and after each application of themagnets; the following, however, is a Table of the results upon the chronometers Nos. 3 and Ak MDCCCXXI.

The rate of the chronomteter No. q, i's very diflferent from that given 'in the former Table ; that of NO-+ is nearly the same, and dloes not appear to) have l5eell affiectedn as 4o. 8 was, by the close approach of the magnet. U~pon the whole, however, it appears that chronometers wi'll'be generally accelerated (particularly 'if their balances, as determined by chronometers at sea. have not received polarity by the too near approach of any thing magnetical) on ship-board. It appears probable, likewise, that the force of the balance springs is affected in the same way; since it is well known that chronometers having gold balance springs, although more difficult to adjust, yet keep better rates at sea than the others. However this may be, these observations show the necessity of not trusting to the rates of chronometers ascertained during the time they are on shore; and if the rates are ascertained on board, the chronometers should always be kept in the same place, and also in the same position with respect to the ship; for I have but little doubt that, upon an accurate trial, a chronometer will be found to change its rate, more or less, according as these circumstances are attended to. If these precautions are not taken, land will appear to be considerably to the westward of its true position; this is particularly exemplified in the observations of the Hon. Captain PHIPPS; from which, nearly the whole line of coast on the west side of East Greenland has been placed nearly iI 0 too mnuch to the westward, by reason of the acceleration of his chronomneters; the same circumstance would have occurred with the chronometers in both of the ships Dorothea and Trent, in the late voyage, had not the longitude been otherwise determined. It is therefore highly requisite that attention should be paid to a circumstance so much connected with the improvement of geography as well as the safety of the seaman. 208 Mr. FISHER on the errors in longitude, &c. As an Appendix to these observations, I beg leave to add the following Table of Rates, furnished by Mr. COLEMAN, to which I have prefixed his letter as an introduction. 157* Leadenkallstreet, sth June. z8az. SIR, IN compliance with the wish of our common friend Lieutenant EvERARD HOME, I have much pleasure in sending you a table of rates of chronometers. My profession as Teacher of Navigation, conjointly with Mr. NoIE, which connects me so intimately with the Officers of the Honourable East India Company, employed on board the ships trading to India, has enabled me to present you with this table upon an en. larged scale. While engaged in the same service eighteen years, this subject occupied my attention, and it affords me much satisfaction that you are bringing the subject before the Royal Society. My remarks correspond very much with those, I understand, you are, now bringing forward., I am, Sir, Your obedient servant, GEORGE COLEMANI. TABLE I. ki g .
