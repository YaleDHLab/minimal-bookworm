[321] A N I N D E X T O T H E S E V E N T Y N I N T H V O L U M E O F T H E PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS. A. ACCOUNT of a bituminous lake or plain, in the island of Trinidad, p. 65. Account of a particular change of structure in the human ovarium, p. 71. Account of a monster of the human species, p. 157. Account of a sinking-in of the ground near Ketton, in Rutland, p. 164. Acid, nitrous. A red heat not necessary to the conversion of nitrous acid into pure air, p. 147. Volatile vitriolic acid contains the proper element of dephlogisticated air, p. 292. Prussian blue supposed to have acquired something that is of the nature of an acid, p. 298. Experiments on the production of nitrous acid and nitrous air, p. 300. A relation subsists between nitrous acid and volatile alkali, ibid. Nitrous acid produced by a mixture of nitrous air and dephlogisticated air, p. 311. Vitriolic acid supposed to have a stronger affinity to the inflammable principle than it has to phlogisticated air, p. 312. Action of points in electricity, experiments on, pp. 278, 281. Air, inflammable or dephlogisticated, when either of them is extracted from any substance in contact with the other kind of air, so that one of them is made to unite with the other in what may be called its nascent state, the result will be fixed air; but if both 7 of [322] of them be completely formed before their union, the result will be nitrous acid, p. 12. All inflammable air, according to the antiphlogistic hypothesis, comes from water only, ibid. A small quantity of inflammable air is procured, by sending a steam over melted sulphur, p. 15. Inflammable air produced by a dissolution of iron in diluted vitriolic acid, ibid. Vitriolic acid air contains the same inflammable principle with inflammable air, p. 16. Nitrous air, when mixed with dephlogisticated air, has no tendency to produce phlogisticated air, p. 149. Nitrous air has no effect on phlogisticated air, ibid. Nitrous air does not contain so much phlogiston as an equal bulk of inflammable air, p. 150. Alkaline air converted into inflammable air, p. 295. Nitrous air and dephlogisticated air by mixture produce nitrous acid; and nitrous air, by mere heat, is converted into a mixture of phlogisticated and dephlogisticated airs, p. 309. Nitrous air changed into phlogisticated air, by abstracting from the nitrous air a quantity of dephlogisticated air, ibid. The residuum of volatile alkaline air, after the calces of lead have been revived in it, is phlogisticated air, p. 311. The vitriolic acid supposed to have a stronger affinity to the inflammable principle than it has to phlogisticated air, p. 312. Alkali, volatile, changed into a mixture of phlogisticated and inflammable air by mere heat, p. 311. Almanack, nautical, the most perfect work of the kind, p. 60. Altitude. See Quadrant of Altitude. Amphibia, a class of animals so called by Linnaeus, p. 21. Observations on this class, ibid. Linnaeus particularly unfortunate in the construction of this class, ibid.

Here are several springs, and one slightly impregnated with iron, ibid. Between Chepta and Pagha, a mineral well, strongly impregnated with iron, discovered by Mr. Saunders, ibid. State of the thermometer at Chepta, ibid. Chooka, two mineral wells slightly impregnated with iron, discovered by Mr. Saunders near, p. 83. Natives of Chooka not unacquainted with the method of extracting iron from the stones, but despise its use in building, ibid. Cold, artificial, experiments relating to the production of, p. 199.

Earth, and other planets of the Copernican system, are bodies not luminous in themselves, p. 213. Eclipse. See Sun. Electricity, experiments and observations on, p. 265. On the excitation of electricity, ibid. Plate machines do not collect more electricity than cylinders do with half the rubbed surface, p. 269. The line of light on a cylinder departing from a simple cushion consists of returning electricity, p. 273. The projecting part of the cushion compensates the electricity upon the cylinder, and by diminishing its intensity prevents its striking back in such large quantities as it otherwise would do, ibid. The method of producing considerable intensity, ibid. The action of the cylinder, by a simple cushion [324] cushion or the hand, was first improved by the addition of a leathern flap; then by moistening the rubber; afterwards by applying the amalgam; and, lastly, by the addition of a flik flap, p. 278. Experiments on the luminous appearance of electricity and the action of points, ibid. The escape of negative electricity from a ball attended with the appearance of strait sharp sparks with a hoarse or chirping noise, pp. 278, 279. A variety of balls in electricity unnecessary, p. 280. Volta's opinion, that a point is the coating to an infinitely small plate of air, erroneous, p. 281. In any electrified conductor the transition or escape of electricity will be made chiefly from that part of the surface which is the most remote from the natural slate, p. 282. Thicker glasses require much less electricity to produce an intensity which breaks them than thinner do, p. 284. The perforation of glass by the long spark, or by the spark through oil or cement, supposed to depend on the intensity of the electricity, which has not time to diffuse itself, but charges a minute part of the surface very high, p. 285. Muscovy talc, a very perfect non-conductor; capable of being divided into plates of less thickness than a two-hundredth part of an inch; in consequence of its great capacity gives very strong electric shocks; and its laminae, contrary to the assertion of Beccaria, are naturally in strong opposite states of electricity, and flash to each other when torn asunder in the dark, ibid. Euler's hypothesis of refraction of the differently refrangible rays of light proved to be false, p. 257. His hypothetical principle neither fit for rendering a telescope achromatic, nor to account for the distinctness of the human vision, ibid. Excitation of electricity, experiments on, p. 265. Strength of the excitation ascertained, ibid. Silk the chief agent in excitation of electricity, p. 271.

Experiments illustrating the subject of producing cold, pp. 209, 210. Experiment illustrating the theory of vision, p. 261. Experiments and observations on electricity, p. 265. Experiments shewing that the office of silk is not merely to prevent the return of electricity from the cylinder to the cushion, but that it is the chief agent in the excitation; while the cushion serves only to supply the electricity, and perhaps increase the pressure at the entering part, pp. 265, 266. Experiments on the luminous appearances of electricity and the action of points, p. 278. Experiments on the action of points in electricity, pp. 281, 282. Experiments on the transmission of the vapour of acids through an hot earthen tube, and further observations relating to phlogiston, p. 289. Experiment on oil of vitriol, ibid. Experiment on spirit of nitre, p. 291. Experiment in which alkaline air is converted into inflammable air, p. 295. Experiments relating to the doctrine of phlogiston, [325] phlogiston, ibid. Experiments shewing that manganese, per se, gives airs of different kinds, but chiefly fixed and dephogisticated airs, as soon as it is subjected to a considerable heat, p. 306. Eyes. Fifteen inches the distance at which the generality of eyes see with the most distinctness, p. 258. F. Fangs, venomous, in serpents, merely offensive weapons, p. 33. Situation of venomous fangs always in the anterior and exterior parts of the upper jaw, p. 34. Frutification chiefly depends on rain falling at the latter end of the season of flowering, p. 39. G. Gentoo Boy, an astonishing living subject, having his brother adhering to his breast, p. 157. Portrait of, p. 159. Glass, the perforation of, by the long electric spark, or by the spark through oil or cement, supposed to depend on the intensity of the electricity, which has not time to diffuse itself, but charges a minute part of the surface very high, p. 285.
