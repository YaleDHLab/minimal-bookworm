There was,not long since,sent hither out of Germany from an inquisitive Physician,a List of several Minerals and Earths of that Country, and of Hungary, together with a Specimen of each of them: among which there was a kind ofLead. Ore which is more considerable than all the rest, because of its singular use for Essays upon the Coppell, seeing that there is not any other Mettal mixed with it. 'Tis found in the Upper Palatinate, at a place called Freyung, and there are two sorts of it, whereof one is a kind of Crystalline Stone, and almost all good Leads the other not so rich, and more farinaceous. By the information, coming along with it, they are fetcht, not from under the ground, but, the Mines of that place having lain long neglected,by reason of the Wars of Germany and the increase of Waters, the people, living there(11) there-about take it from what their Forefathers had thrown away, and had lain long in the open Air. The use above mentioned being considerable, the person, who sent it, hath been intreated, to inform what quantities may be had of it, if there should be occasion to send for some.
