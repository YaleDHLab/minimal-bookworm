Reduce [367] Reduce the parts of 96 to degrees, and take the mean between the zenith distances shewn on each scale, and the zenith distance of ~ Draconis on the quadrantal arch ~ ~ ~ ~ will be 9 21,7, and on the arch of excess 8 54, whence ~ ~ the true zenith distance is 9 7,8, and the error of the ~ line of collimation 13,8, to be subtracted from the numbers shown on the limb of the quadrant. In like manner we shall find the true zenith distance of ~ Draconis o ~ ~ ~ 1 6 19,8, and the error of the line of collimation 13,5. If we suppose the apparent declination of ~ Draconis on o ~ ~ July 12th to be 52 28 52,3, that of ~ Draconis o ~ ~ 51 31 41,7, we have the latitude from the former 52~ 38~, and from the latter 52~ 38~ 1~. N. B. Some observations on these two stars in July 1772, give the same latitude within less than 2~, but make the error of the line of collimation 23~ to be subtracted. I suspect the line of collimation is liable to small variations in portable quadrants, if not in all. VOL. LXV.

To this add 7,5 for the increase of apparent declination between Nov. 12. and Dec. 12. and we have the zenith distance on Dec. 12. (as derived from the observations in November) 35~ 28~ 41~. D d d 2 The [370] The same from the actual observations on Dec. 6. and 15. is 35~ 28~ 44~. The mean of these two, corrected for the line of collimation, gives the true zenith distance above o ~ ~ the pole, 35 28 28,9. The observations of Dec. 12. 13. 15. cleared of refraction and corrected for the line of collimation, give the true zenith distance below the pole, o ~ ~ o ~ ~ 39 15 33,1, whence the latitude 52 37 59, and the apo ~ ~ parent declination of the pole star, Dec. 12th, 88 6 27,9. From all these observations we may conclude the latitude of (St. Martin's church in) Leicester is 52~ 38~, within very few seconds (a). From some observations made with an HADLEY'S quadrant of six inches radius, and given in the Transactions for 1769, I made the latitude only 52~ 37~ 3~; but those observations cannot be set in competition with these, either for weight or number.
