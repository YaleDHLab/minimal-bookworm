XXV. Observations on the changes the egg undergoes du rng incubation in the common fowl, illustrated by microscopical drawings. By Sir EVERARD HOME, Bart. V' P. R. S. Read May i6, 18e22 H is has been a favourite subject with many of the most celebrated anatomists. The great HARVEY, MALPIGHI, and JOHN HUNTER, have done more than any others in the advancement of this enquiry. HUNTER'S observations were never rendered so complete as to induce him to publish them ; but what he has done is open to the public, both in the preparations in his Collection, and in his Cabinet of Drawings. In these last, the vesicle which begins near the rectum, and afterwards envelopes the embryo, is clearly made out, In the year Ii8i5, Mr. DUTROcHET, an ingenious French anatomist, laid a Memoireupon this subject before the French Academie. Mr. G. CUvIER has given a Report upon this Memoire, but has not given the Memoire itself. He considers the author to be the first person who has clearly explained the rise and progress of the vesicle but some of Mr. HUNTER'S drawings of it are dated 1773, the year I went to live in his house. After all that has been done, much is still wanting to render the investigation complete; and to promote this object, the follOWing Observations and Drawings are brought before the Society. The gelatinous molecule, from which the future embryo 34o Sir EVERARD HOME on the changes the egg undergoes is to be formed, is originally placed on the surface of the yelk; it is found there before the yelk leaves the ovarium, and lies loose upon it, not being enveloped in any capsule. The external membrane of the yelk is very thin and delicate, its surface is studded over with red dots, which disappear in its passage along the oviduct. When this is removed, there is a second thick and spongy covering under it, in which there is a natural aperture ; and the areola, surrounding the molecule, is-nothing more than the surface of the yelk, that is circumscribed by the margin of this aperture. No such aperture has been before taken notice of. The molecule itself has a granulated appearance; in the centre it is made up of globules j2L-d part of an inch in diameter, surrounded by circles of a mixed substance, consisting of about two-thirds of the same small globules, and one-third of larger oval globules, about I600 part of an inch in length, and 2 part in diameter; these last, in their figure, resemble the red globules of the blood in the bird in every respect, excepting their red colour. Besides the globules there is some fine oil, which appears in drops when the parts are immersed in water. Oval globules and oil are also met with in the yelk itself, but in small proportion, and without colour. All these parts, except the red dots on the surface, are met with in the yelk on at smaller scale, even six days before it is completely formed. The ovarial yelk-bag gives way at the middle line, farthest from the insertion of the blood-vessels, and the yelk drops out into the mouth of the oviduct. The yelk.bag does not immediately close, although it conduring incubation in the common fowl. tracts considerably: some time after it is nearly obliterated; and on the pedicle, the rudiments of a new yelk are formed. The yelk-bags are exceedingly vascular; the outer membrane of the yelks is connected to them by vessels and fasciculi of fibres, but easily separated. The yelk, while in the ovarium, has an oval form, and lies with its long axis towards the pedicle of the bag. See Plate XXXII. figures 1,2 , 3, 4,5 . In its passage along the oviduct the yelk acquires the albumen, and before it comes to the lower end, the albumen is covered by a very fine membrane. In this passage the thread-like substances, called by Mr. HUNTER the poles, by others the chalazes, are formed; and terminate in the double membrane, which is added at the time the egg has reached the enlargement at the lower end of the oviduct. In the cloacus the shell is formed. If the egg is taken out before it has acquired a shell, it remains soft for several days,; in one instance, after four days, it was so semitransparent as to receive a yellow tint from the yelk. On puncturing the covering, the contents rushed out, but immediately resumed their form, being inclosed in the thin membrane of the albumen. The molecule with its areola, and the chalazes, were distinctly seen. The whole contents had less volume than the shell, particularly in the long axis, being truncate at both extremities. When immersed for an hour and half in distilled vinegar, the albumen and other parts had become somewhat coagulated. Plate XXXII. fig. 6, 7, 8 9. In the new laid egg the appearances are exactly the sameb 349 Sir EvERARD HOME on the changes the egg undergoes whether it is impregnated or not. Plate XXXII. fig. io, 11, 12. When the shell and membranes under it are removed from one side, the yelk appears to be kept in its place by the poles, although allowed to rotate upon its axis. The gelatinous molecule, with its areola, is always found upon the highest point of the upper surface of the yelk. Whether this arises from the molecule, or from the areola being the lightest part of the yelk, has not been ascertained. When the hen begins to sit, a new laid egg, which has not been allowed to cool, will have the rudiments of the embryo formed some hours sooner than in the other eggs. Having traced the formation of the egg itself through all the changes that take place from the time the yelk leaves the ovarium till it is impregnated, we are now to follow those changes that are met with during incubation till the em. bryo becomes a completely formed chicken. In 4 hours after incubation the outer edge of the areola had become enlarged, and that part of it next the molecule appeared darker. One end of the molecule appeared like a white line, the first rudiments of the embryo. Plate XXXIII. fig. I.,, , In 8 hours, the white line was found to be extended, and the rudiments of a brain and spinal marrow were formed, surrounded by a membrane, which afterwards becomes amnion. The areola had extended itself, and the surface beyond the line which formed its boundary had acquired the consistence of a membrane, and had also a distinct line by which it was during incubation in the commonfowl 343. circumscribed. This I shall call the outer areola. In the space between these two areolas, there were distinct dots of an oily matter. This extension of' membrane to the outer areola lies under the inner membrane of the yelk, and can readily be removed entire. Plate XXXIII. fig. 4, 5, 6. In 12 hours, the rudiments of the brain were more distinct, as well as of the spinal marrow. These parts were placed upon a black ground in vinegar, and hardened; the upper end showed the tuberculum annulare of the brain, from which passed down two semi-transparent lines resembling an appearance peculiar to the spinal marrow of the bird. Plate XXXIII. fig. 7, 8, 9. In 16 hours, there was a farther advance in the structure of all these parts. Plate XXXIV. fig. 1, 2, 3. In 24 hours, a still greater increase. Plate XXXIV. fig. 4, 56. In 36 hours, the head was turned to the left side. The cerebrum and cerebellum appeared to be distinct bodies; the iris was seen through the pupil of the eye. The intervertebral nerves were nearly completely formed ; those nearest the head the most distinct. A portion of the heart was seen. At this period, under the inner areola, apparently at the termination of the spinal marrow, a vesicle had begun to protrude. In some eggs it is seen earlier than in others, and has been observed before the heart had become visible. Plate XXXIV. fig. 7, to 9. In 2 days 12 hours, the spinal marrow was found to have its posterior part enclosed; the auricles and ventricles of the heart were seen, the auricles filled with red blood. An arterial trunk from the left ventricle gave off' two large 344 Sir EVERARD HOME on the changes the egg undergoes vessels, one to the right side of the abdomen of the embryo, the other to the left, sending branches over the whole of the areolar membrane, which was bounded on each side by a large trunk carrying red blood; but the two trunks did not unite, there being a small space on one side rendering the circle incomplete. The vesicle was somewhat increased in size; it lay in the lower part of the abdomen, the parietes of which were not yet formed. Plate XXXV. fig. 1, 2, 3. In 3 days, the outer areola had extended itself over I of the circumference of the yelk, carrying the marginal arteries along with it to the outer edge, but diminished in size. The brain was much enlarged, consisting of four cavities containing a fluid, the cerebellum still the largest. The spinal marrow and its nerves were more perfectly formed. The eye appeared only to want the nigrum pigmentum. The right ventricle of the heart contained red blood: the arteries could be traced to the head: the rudiments of the wings and legs were formed: the vesicle was farther enlarged, but its vessels did not carry red blood. It had forced its way out through the external covering of the yelk, and opened a communication through this slit, by which a part of the albumen was admitted to mix itself with the yelk, and give it a more oval form, At this period the embryo is generally found to have changed its position, and to be wholly turned on the left side. Plate XXXV. fig. 4,, 6 In 4 days, the vesicle was more enlarged and more vascular, its vessels containing red blood. The optic nerve and nigrum pigmentum of the eye were visible the other parts had become more perfectly formed, during incubation in the common fowl. 845 The outer areola had extended itself half over the yelk, which had now become still more encreased in size, a greater portion of albumen having become mixed with it. Plate XXXV. fig. 7, 8, 9. In 5 days, the membranous bag that formed the vesicle had acquired a great size, and become exceedingly vascular in its coats ; the cavity contained a fluid. The yelk had become thinner in its consistence, more of the albumen having been mixed with it. Plate XXXVJ. fig. 1,2, . In 6 days, the vascular membrane of the areola had extended farther, over the yelk. Thevesicle at this time had suddenly expanded itself in form of a double nightcap over the yelk and its coverings, beginning to enclose the embryo. This change is so rapid, that it has been with difficulty detected, and different accounts have been given of the mode in which it takes place. The amnion contained water, in which the embryo floated suspended by the vessels supplying the areolar and vesicular membrane. The brain had become enlarged to the size of the body of the embryo: its vessels were distinctly seen' The two eyes equalled in size the whole brain: the marsupium was seen covered with nigrum pigmentum. The vessels of the cerebellum could be traced into the convolutions of the pia mater. The parietes of the thorax and abdomen had begun to form;the wings and legs were nearly completely formed, as well as the bill. At this period muscular action was first noticed. Plate XXXVI. fig. 4, A, 6. In 7 days, the vesicle having extended over the embryo, MDcCCcXIx. Y y 346 Sir EVERARD HOMEon the changes the egg undergoes had begun to enclose the areolar covering of the yelk, and a pulsation was distinctly seen in the trunk that supplied the vesicular bag, with blood. The pulsations were 79 in a minute while the embryo was kept in the temperature of 1o5, but when the temperature was diminished the pulsation ceased, and when restored was reproduced. The pulsation was kept up, by attention being paid to the temperature, for 36 hours. Muscular action had become vigorous in the limbs. When the embryo was completely immersed, although the temperature of the water was io8', the pulsations immediately,ceased, the blood being no longer aerated. Plate XXXVI. fig. 7, 8, 9. In 8 days, the anastomosing branches of the vesicular circulation had the arterial pulsation very strong in them. Plate XXXVII. fig. 1, 2, 3. In 9 days, the vesicle had nearly enclosed the yelk, but not intirely; for when the embryo was turned upon its back, and the opposite surface examined, a portion of yelk was unenclosed, and beyond it som-le of the albumen was met With not mixed with the yelk, Plate XXXVIIL fig. 4, 5,6. In ic days, the vesicle was opened, and the upper half turned aside. When the amnion, which had become full of water, was opened and the embryo taken out, the thorax was found completely enclosed; the roots of the feathers were distinct, and the passage for the areolar as well as the vesicular vessels exposed. In 14 days, the yelk remained out of the body. When the thorax and abdomen were opened, and the heart as well as the lobes of the liver turned aside, the trunks of the bloodvessels could be traced tothe heart; but as the arteries duning incubation in the common fowl. 847 immediately after death become empty and the veins remrain full, the vein from the vesicle, and that from the areola were the most conspicuous. In i8 days, the greater part of the yelk was drawn into the body. In 2o days, the chick was completely formed ; the yelk was entirely drawn in, and only some portions of the membrane of the vesicle appeared externally. The yelk passed into the intestine a little way above the openings of the coeca. Having traced the progress of the formation of the chick step by step, from the first appearance of the molecule found on the yelk before it leaves the ovarium, to the complete evolution of all its parts, and its leaving the shell, I shall now take advantage of this investigation, which, illustrated as it is by Mr. BAUER'S microscopical drawings, will stand long without a parallel. Although the processes by which the human foetus and that of quadrupeds are formed, differ in many essential particulars from those employed in the bird, some circumstances are common to both; one of these, the mode in which the veside bursts the membranes of the yelk is distinctly seen in the embryo in the egg hatched out of the body, and explains what takes place where the embryo is attached to the uterus, which otherwise could not have been ascertained. In a former paper, I have shown the formation of the ovum in the corpus luteum; I have traced this ovum into the uterus, where it became concealed in the soft flocculent bed of efflorescent coagulable lymph prepared to receive it. That it is afterwards enveloped in this moss-like covering, has been demonstrated by my revered master 'in Human Anatomy, ,18 Sir EvERARD HOME on the changes the egg undergoes Dr.WILLIAM HUNTER; but in what manner the embryo breaks its amnion, and opens a communication with the uterus, is a question on which Dr. HUNTER is silendt: indeed it is one that could not be touched upon till it was ascertained that the ovum, when it arrived at the uterus, was completely enclosed in the amnion. Having been the first to ascertain that curious fact, and having arrived at that knowledge through the microscopical observations of Mr. BAUER, I am peculiarly gratified, that the same powers, exerted in another correspondent investigation, should have enabled me to give the solution. In the ovum of the hen, the rudiments of the embryo require nourishment from one source, aeration from another. In the human ovum one source supplies both ; but in either case there is a necessity for a communication between the blood vessels of the embryo and the source of their blood's aeration; and this is effected in exactly the same manner in the human species, the quadruped, and the bird. Out of this the embryo acquires a mode of suspension in the amnion which secures it from injury, both in the bird and quadruped. The mode is as follows: that bag, which is afterwards in the human species and in quadrupeds to become the urinary bladder, is enlarged to a certain size with such rapidity, that it bursts the amnion, which is prepared to be so ruptured, and the arteries lying upon its two sides are carried directly into contact with the chorion, and there the placenta is formed in the open space between the two edges of the chorion. This is exactly similar to the vesicle in the chick bursting the co. vering of the yelk, and forming the enveloping bag. It is deserving of remark, that in the human ovum, and that of during incubation in the common fowl. 349 quadrupeds, there isa natural opening in the external membrane; in the bird, the natural opening is in the internal one, which in its structure bears a resemblance to the chorion.
