Extract of a Letter of the Reverend Mr. Joseph Spence, Professor of Modern History in the University of Oxford, to Dr. Mead, F. R. S. Byfleet near Weybridge, Surrey, December 7, 1753. I Have lately received a letter from Signor Paderni at Portici; in which, speaking of the publication of the antiquities found at Herculaneum, he says, Spero ~ il primo tomo non tardera molto tempo ad uscire; and then mentions some particular things, that had been lately discovered among the ruins; a little brass bust of some unknown philosopher, of an excellent manner, and perfectly well preserved: A statue of an orator, in marble; and another brass bust, on a term, of a youth, with particularly beautiful hair, and the whole excellent. The artist has put his name to the latter, A~O~~~NIO~ APXIOY A~HNAIO~ E~OIH~E. He says, that the workmen were then just entering on some nobleman's house, as appeared by the rich mosaic pavements, &c. and that they were in hopes it would prove a very good new mine. LXII.
