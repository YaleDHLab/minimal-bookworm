LXIX. Extract of a Letter from Mons. Allemond, Professor of Natural Philosophy at Leyden, and F. R. S. to Mr. Trembley, F. R. S. Translated from the French. Leyden, Jan. 27, 1756. ON the night between the 26th and 27th of the last month of December, 1755, between eleven o'clock and midnight, there was a considerable earthquake on the frontiers of this country. It was felt at Liege, Maestricht, Nimeguen, Arnheim, and, according to some accounts, at Breda. There were three different shocks, the last of which happened at about four in the morning, 4 but Read Feb. 19, 1756. [513] but without any noise or accident. I have been informed by letters from Switzerland, that several shocks were felt there, and that the salt-springs of Bevieux have been rendered more salt. At Amersfort, in the province of Utrecht, on the fifteenth of this month, was felt a shock of an earthquake, which occasioned great consternation, but no damage. LXX.
