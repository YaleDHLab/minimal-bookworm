XX. A? Account of the Trigonometrical Survey carried on in the Years 1-795, and 1796, by Order of the Marquis Cornwallis, Master General of the Ordnance. By Colonel Edward Williams, Captain William Mudge, and Mr. Isaac Dalby. Communicated by the Duke of Richmond, F. R. S. Read May 11, 1797. PART FIRST. PREAMBLE. A bcCORDING to the resolution expressed in the account of the Trigonometrical Survey, printed in the Philosophical Transactions for the year It 795, we now communicate to the public, through the same channel, a farther relation of its progress. On referring to the above paper, it will be found that, for the prosecution of this undertaking, a design was formed of proceeding to the westward, with a series of triangles, for the survey of the coast. This intention has been carried into effect; and as the small theodolite, or circular instrument, announced in our former communication as then in the hands of Mr. RAMSDEN, was finished early in the summer of 1795, we are enabled to give a series of triangles, extending, in conjunction with those before given, from the Isle of Thanet, in Kent, to the Land's End. In the composition of the following account, we have adhered to the plan adopted in the last, of giving the angles of Th De Account, &c. 43, the great triangles, with their variations; and we have, with as much brevity as possible, inserted a narrative of each year's operations. This will be found, however, to extend only to the First Part, or that containing the particulars of the survey in which the great instrument alone was used. The remaining contents of this portionof the work, are necessarily confined to the angles of the principal, and secondary triangles, with the calculations of their sides, in feet; and likewise such data as have no connection with the computations of latitudes and longitudes. Part the Second contains an account of a survey carried on in Kent, in the years 1795 and 1796, with the small instrument, by order of the Master General, for completing a map ofthe eastern and southern parts of that county, for the use of the Board of Ordnance, and the military commanders on the coast. In Part the First will be found an article, for which we are indebted to Dr. MASKELYNE, the Astronomer Royal. It contains his demonstration of M. DE LAMBRE'S formula, in. the Connoissanzce dcs Temps of 1793, for reducing a distance on the sphere to any great circle near it, or the contrary., The practical rule thence derived, for reducing the angles in the plane of the horizon, to those formedby the chords, is very useful and will considerably abridge the trouble which must necessarily arise in computing the chord corrections by any former method. 431 The Account of a SECTION FIRST. ARTICLE I. Of Particulars relating to the Operations of the Year 1795. In an early part of this season, from the necessity which existed of completing the map of Kent, mentioned in the preamble, we had conceived that our former intentions, of continuing the survey towards the west, would for the present be relinquished; as it was not imagined that the telescope of the small circular instrument, then in the hands of Mr. RAMSDEN, could be applied, with good effect, in observing staffs erected on very distant stations. From the obvious importance, however, of adhering to the first resolution, it was determined that a trial should be made of the excellence of this instrument, in the construction of which extraordinary pains had been taken, by operating with it in Kent, and using it for those purposes to which, if the object before spoken of had not been in view, the great theodolite would have been necessarily applied. This smaller theodolite, therefore, as a substitute, was in May taken into Kent by Mr. DALBY, and Mr. GARDNER, chief draughtsman in the Tower; the assistance of the former being necessary, as the stations in the series of 1787 were for the most part unknown to the latter gentleman. As the former paper, relating to the trigonometrical survey, could not be presented to the Royal Society before the 4th of June, the business did not commence till the 12th of the same month. The party then left London, and the instrument was taken to Bull Barrow, in Dorsetshire. Trigonometrical Survey. 45 On a reference to the account of 1795, it will be seen, that a station wvas chosen near Lulworth, and observed both from Nine Barrow Dowvn and Black Down. It was also intended to be observed from Bull Barrow;by which means the great triangle, formed by the stations Black Down, Nine Barrow Down, and Bull Barrow, would be divided into, and made to consist of, two smaller triangles. This, however, it was now found could not be done, as a signal house had been erected near the station at Lulworth, subsequent to the operations in 1794, which prep vented that. spot from being afterwards seen at Bull Barrow: but no consequences very injurious can have arisen from the impracticability of making use of this station in the manner originally proposed, since the stations formerly chosen in Portland, with which that of Lulworth was also intended to connect, have not been visited with the instrument. The stations in that island were selected with a view of observing from them, and Charton Common, some point in the vicinity of Torbay, which might be a proper station in the series intended to be carried along the coast. Such a situation, however, could not 'be conveniently found, as the view of Devonshire from Charton Common is much interrupted by trees and other obstacles; and it would have been highly improper to shorten the side, between Pilsden Hill and the coast, by choosing a station more remote from the latter than Charton Common. As from an inspection of the plan of the triangles annexed to this account, a doubt may be entertained as to the propriety of carrying on so very extensive a series from the short side connecting the stations on Black Down and Mintern Hill; it must be observed that, admitting the necessity of adopting Bull Barrow for a station, those on Pilsden and Mintern Hills were MDCCXCVII. e L 436 The Account of a naturally chosen; the first, because it connected with Dumpdon (a station that could not be dispensed with).; and the second, because it was the point most remote fro-n Black Down, being on the brow of the high land overlooking the general surface -of Somersetshire. To connect with the station formerly chosen near Maiden Bradley, two others were selected whilst the party were at Bull Barrow; one on Ash Beacon, near Sherborne, and the other on the Quantock Hills. Both these have very commanding views, and will hereafter easily unite with any stations which -may be chosen to the northward. From Bull Barrow, the instrument was successively taken to the following stations, before any other new ones were chosen, vi. Mintern, Pilsden, and Charton Common; and whilst the party were at the latter, nearly all the stations were selected in Devonshire. In the choice of these, much difficulty occurred, as the face of this county is particularly unfavourable for operations of this kind. Around Honiton and Chard, there are several small ranges of hills, nearly of an equal height, running in parallel directions. Near the former are three, thus circumstanced; viz. Hembury Fort, Combe Raleigh, and Dumpdon. From the first and second of these, the station on Chartoft Common is not visible; and it is from the last onlyr that both Pilsden and the Quantock Hills can be seen. This station, however, has a disadvantage: Combe Raleigh, which ris to the west of it, takes off all view round Tiverton and Silferton; so that it became indispensably necessary to select a spot on the northern extremity of Dartmoor, called Cawsand Beacon. To those who are acquainted with the interior of Dartmoor, Trigonometrical Survey. 437 it will be unnecessary to assign the reason for not having chosen any station. towards its centre. It may be sufficient to observe, that two spots were found on its circumference, vhich Tender the want of it trifling in its consequences. Independent of the stations to which, as we have before observed, the instrument was taken this year, the following were visited, viz. Dumpdon, Little Haldon, Furland, and Butterton. From the latter, the party returned to London in the month of October. ART. II. Angles taken in the rear 1795. At Bull Barrow. Between a I Al Mean.

III. Of Particulars relating to the Operations of the Year 1796In the account of this Survey, published in the Philosophical Transactions for 1795, page 473, it is stated, that large stones were sunk in the ground at the extremities of the base of verification on Salisbury Plain. To render these points permanent, two iron cannon (selected from among the unserviceable ordinance in Woolwich Warren) were, towards the end of February, sent to Salisbury, and in the beginning of March inserted at the ends of the base. The same methods were adopted, for the purpose of fixing these cannon in their proper positions, as those made use of when similar termini were sunk in the ground on Hounslow Heath. This operation having been completed on the ioth of March, the instrument was shortly after carried to Kit Hill, in Cornwall; a station, like that on Bindown, chosen rather for the purpose of a secondary, than a principal place of observation. It would be tedious, and perhaps unnecessary, to enumerate the names of all the stations selected this year, as many of them do not form any part of the series now given to the publie. We shall, therefore, confine ourselves to such remarks on the subject as may serve to abridge this article. We have before stated, that a station was chosen on Cawsand Beacon, the northern extremity of Dartmoor, for the purpose of connecting with Dumpdon. It should have been observed, that to the westward of the former eminence, and near it, there is a hill considerably higher, which in point of situation has many advantages, but which cannot be made Trigonometrical Survey. 441 use of on account of the ruggedness of its surface, which seem& to render the carrying of the instrument to its top almost irmpossible. From this circumstance, and similar impediments, which the high lands remote from the circumference of Dartmoor offer to our operations, it results, that the body of this moor cannot have any great triangles carried over it: such stations were therefore selected this year as may serve, in conjunction with others,, to include this tract of country in a polygon of a small number of sides.. To make observations for the purpose of hereafter determining the longitude and latitude of the Lizard,,. was a. print cipal object in this year's operations; and as this headland: seems to offer itself as very convenient for a station, it will be right to assign our reasons for not having chosen one upon it. As no other spot but Hensbarrow Beacon could be found in. that part of Cornwall proper for a station, it became necessary to fix on the Deadman, or Dodman., for another point in the series. From this place nor part of the land within four miles of the Lizard can be seen,. as the high ground about Black H-ead, which is to the eastward of the latter, isnearly in a line between them, and is also much higher than both. It will be perceived, however, that no evil can result from the want of' such a station, as the light-houses and the naval-signal-staff at the Lizard, have been intersected from several stations. The precise spot on which Mr. BRADLEY made his observations in the year 176,9, for ascertaining the longitude and latitude of this headland, wvas pointed out by the person. having the care of the light-houses, who well remembered the common particulars relating to his operations such measurements were made from the light-houses to this spot, as may enable us, at a future 442 The Account of a period, to compare the results, from the data affordedby the trigonometrical operation, with those deduced front the astronomical observations made by the above gentleman. It may be also mentioned, that angles were -at the same time taken at the western light-house and signal-staff, for the purpose of finding the situation of the Lizard Point. We are now to speak of the most important business performed this year; that of making observations to determine the distance of the Scilly Isles from the Land's End. To do this as accurately as possible, it became necessary to find stations affording the longest base. The hill near Rosemergy, called the Watch, and the station near St. Buryan, are certainly the most advantageous places, because all the islands can be seen from both; but we could not avail ourselves of the former, as difficulties almost insuperable would have attended an attempt to get the instrument upon it. Another station was therefore selected, on Karnminnis, near St. Ives; a spot as well situated as the place spoken of, provided all the islands could be seen : this, however, does not prove to be the case, St. Martin's Day-Mark being the only object in the Scilly Islands visible from Karnminnis. From. the stations near the Land's End (Sennen and Pertinney), as well as that above mentioned (St. Buryan), St. Agnes' Light-house, and two objects in St. Mary's, were observed; and as the means by which all their distances are determined, except those of the Day-Mark, from the shortness of the bases (which were, however, the longest that could be found) are exceptionable, it will be right to mention, that while we were engaged in that part of the operation now spoken of, the air was so unusually clear, that we could sometimes, with the Trigoloinetrical Survey. 443 telescope of the great theodolite, discover the soldiers at exercise in St. Mary's island. Under this article, it will be convenient to state, that -we have endeavoured to find some spot to the westward, on which a base might be measured. Had we been fortunate in this respect, it undoubtedly would be eminently advantageous; as those triangles, now extended to the Land's End, would, in that case, be verified in some part of the new series. In Devonshire and Cornwall, however, no place has been discovered by any means fit for the purpose; so that our communicating this work, under the circumstances attending it, is a matter of necessity. In the present and former seasons, such stations were selected and observed, as were judged to be proper for the future use of the small instrument; and as we had experienced, in the early stage of this Survey, much delay and disappointment from the white lights notbeing always seen when fired on distant stations, we have since substituted lamps and staffs in their stead. The operations of the present year were continued till October, when the party returned to London. ART. IV. Angles taken in the Tear 1796. At Kit Hill. Between / , , Mean.

If the answer is required in seconds, the correction must be multiplied by 206265, the number of seconds in an arc = radius.: The calculation will be easily made by logarithms. Practical Rule. The practical rule deduced from the above conclusions is the following, and given in the words of the Astronomer Royal. "To the constant logarithm 5,0134 add L . t, a and L. "cv s D + d; the sum diminished by 20 in the index is the "c logarithm of the first part of the value of d a in seconds, " which is always negative. To the constant logarithm 5,o34, "c add L . t', 2 a, and L. vs, D d, the sum diminished by 20 " in the index, is the logarithm of the second part in seconds, " which is always affirmative'. These two joined together, ac" cording to their proper signs, will give the approximate value "of d a. To its logarithmic versed sine, add L. t', a and con"stant logarithm 5,3144, the sum, diminished by 20 -in the " index, will be the logarithm of the third part in seconds, "which will be negative or affirmative, according as a is less "or more than goo. This applied according to its sign, to the 3 N ,2 45,4* The Account of a " approximate value of d a, will give the correct value of d a. "If the third part comes out considerable, it should be com"puted anew with the last value of d a. The value of d a, finally corrected, applied to a, will give A, the angle between "the chords." In the application of the above rule, to the computation of such corrections as may be applied to the angles of any triangles in this survey, it is manifest that the last step may be entirely neglected on account of the smallness of the approximate value of d a, whose versed sine is one of the arguments. Being, therefore, confined to the use of the two first steps, the operation is very short. An example is here given in the computation of the correction for reducing the angle at Chanctonbury Ring in. the 39th triangle, given in the last account (see Phil. Trans. for 1795 p. 492), to that formed by the chords EXAMPLE. Constant logarithm 5,0134 5,0134 Log. tang.

Reduce the elevations, or depressions, to the place of the axis of the telescope at each station,. by adding, or subtracting, as the case may require, the angle at the place of observation, subtended by the vertical height between the object, whose elevation or depression was observed, and the axis of the telescope when at that station.* 2. Then, if both are depressionss, subtract their sum from the contained arc, and half the remainder is the mean re-fraction.. A. If one is a depression and the other an elevation,. take their difference. Then, if the depression is greater than the elevation, subtract the difference from the contained arc, and half the remainder is the mean refraction. But if the elevation is greatest, add the difference to the contained are. and half thee sumn is the mean refraction ART. iII. Table containing the Heights of the Stations. Stations. Heights.

At the station on Hensbarrow, the ground at Bodmin Down was depressed 31' 27": the distance of those stations is 47337 feet; and the axis of the telescope was 5I feet above the ground: therefore, as 473,37 : radius:: 5 feet tang. 24" the angle subtended by 5{ feet at that distance; which, taken from 3"' 27', gives 31' 3" for the depression of the place of the axis, instead of the ground. Again, at Bodmin Down, the ground at Hensbarrow was elevated 23' 57", to which adding 24", we have 7n4! 2zi for the elevation of the place of the axis. Trigonometrical Survey. 47 1 Stations. Heights.

Remarks, &c. on theforegoing Table. The height of the ground at the station on Maker Heights, 402 feet, was determined by levelling down to low-water mark, near the passage house, below Mount Edgcumbe, on April ij, :1796. This, however, hadc been done several years before, by some officers of the Royal Engineers, who found it to be 401 feet. The height of tlhe station near Dunnose,. in the Isle of Wight, was also found by levelling; of which an account is given in the Philosophical Transactions for 1795. It therefore 472 .DThe Account of a may be considered as the least exceptionable mode of procedure, to deduce the intermediate heights from both those stations; for which purpose, the following comparison wasmade, exhibiting the height of the station on Charton Common, both ways. Feet. Height of Nine Barrow Down (Phil.

Now, supposing the difference, or the errors, to arise from the mean refractions, and those errors to be nearly the same between every two stations, we shall obtain the corrected heights in the following manner: Feet. Nine Barrow Down 642 4 638 Black Down 825 8 = 8]7 Charton Common 597 15 = 582 Butterton 1201 + 2 = 1203 as in the table. Rippin Tor 1545 + 4 = 1549 Haldon 811 + 7= 8i8 Charton Common 568 + 14 = 582J Trigonometrical Survey. 473 From those corrected heights, the others to the northward have been deduced. The heights to the westward of Butterton were determined from that of Maker. A mean of two or three results, by using -Iof the contained arcs for refraction, is taken for the height of the station on Mintern Hill. We subjoin the following elevations and depressions, for the use of those who may wish to examine the tables of heights and refractions, in the Philosophical Transactions for 1795. And here it is to be noted, that the axis of the telescope was always about Ad feet from the ground, unless the contrary is specified. At Hanger Hill.

Naval-Signal-staff 77 4 Western Light-house 60 jo Lizard Point These, with the computed distance from the Signal-staff to the Light-house, give the distance of the Lizard Point from the Signal staf ?4l91feet. Hence, the distance of the point LLight-house 2700J from the station on Karnbonellis is 81o85 feet, the angle at that station, between the Lizard Point and Western Light-house, being 1i S5' 47". With respect to the means by which the situation of the spot, on which Mr. BRADLEY erected his observatory in 1769, may hereafter be determined, it will be readil understood from the following diagram; where E is the Eastern Light-house, W the Western Light-house, F the Signal-staff, P the Lizard Point, and 0 the place of the Observatory.

In like manner the 312th and 313th triangles seem to prove, that the observations made to St. Agnes' Light-house were sufficiently accurate, as there is a difference only of 16 feet between the distances of the Light-house from Pertinney. The ball on the top of the Light-house was the object always observed; and the Day-Mark being pyramidical, we had the means of making the observations at the different stations to the same point of this building. 506 The Account Of a ART. V. Of the Distances of the Objects in the Scilly Isles, (inter, sected from the Stations in the West of Cornwall) from Sennen Steeple; the Stone near the Land's End; and the Longship's Light-house. As the observations made to the Day Mark, and St. Agnes' Light-house, may be supposed sufficiently accurate; and the ball on the top of the Longship's Light-house was also observed under favourable circumstances, it will be proper to apply the corrections to the horizontal angles, in order to obtain those formed by the chords. Taking, therefore, Pertinney as the angular point, and computing with the following data;, viz. (Day-Mark = I154-55 Station on Pertinney from .St. Agnes' Light-house 182207 Feet.

PART SECOND. SECTION I. Account of a Trigonometrical Survey carried on in Kent, in the rears 1795, and 1796, with the small circular Instrument. ARTICLE I. Particulars respecting the Instrument. The instrument used in this survey was announced in the Philosophical Transactions for 1795, p. 590. It was made by Mr. RAMSDEN; and is about half the size of his large theodolite, or circular instrument, with which we take the horizontal angles, but nearly similar to it in all its parts; consequently a very brief description will be sufficient. rTh?e most material variations in the construction are, i. The levelling or feet screws. These are below that horizontal movement which serves to direct the lower telescope to any particular object. By this position of the screws, the horizontal circle being once made level, the whole instrument may be moved round without disturbing its horizontality; the levelling screws remaining stationary during that operation, MDCCXCVII. 3 U 5o8 The Account of a which cannot be done in the large instrument, because the screws are carried round with it. 2. The diameter of the horizontal circle being only half that of the larger one, it follows, that the space between any two dots on the limb, givesd ouble the number of minutes that are contained in the same space on the greater circle: on this account, each revolution in the micrometer screw in the microscope answers to 2'; and the circle on the microscopic micrometer being divided into 6o parts, each division becomes equal to 2", but for thne conveniency of notation, they are numbered at every 5th, with 1o, 20, &c. to Zo, the Goth being marked i, to denote i': the number of seconds then, commencing as before, the whole revolution becomes 2'. The revolutions are counted by means of notches on one side of the field in the microscope, in the same manner as in those of the large instrument. &. This instrument not being intended for determining the direction of. the meridian, a vertical semicircle for directing the telescope to the pole star became unnecessary;, yet some apparatus was required, whereby small elevations or depressions from the horizon might be ascertained with a tolerable degree of precision. For this purpose, a moveable index, of about four inches long, is made to turn on the horizontal axis of the upper telescope, and so constructed, that by means of a finger screw, it can be fixed firmly in any position. The lower end of this index is furnished with a steel micrometer screw, having a circle on its head, divided into 1oo parts, for shewing the fractional parts of a revolution, while other divisions, on a chamfered edge of the index which marks the fractional parts, give the number of revolutions made by the micrometer screw. Trigonometrical Survey. 509 The method of finding the value of a revolution of the micrometer head in parts of a degree, &c. was as follows: A rod, 14 or 16 feet long, was placed horizontally about three quarters of a mile off, and the angle subtended by its ends measured with the instrument in the usual way: the rod was then set up perpendicular at the same place, and the cross wires in the telescope directed to one of its extremities: the telescope was then moved in the vertical plane, by means of the micrometer screw, till the cross wires coincided with the other extremity. In this manner, by counting the number of revolutions, &c. necessary to move the telescope from one position to the other, an angle was measured vertically with the micrometer screw, equal to the former horizontal angle. From repeated trials, the value of a revolution was found equal to 1o' 27". This instrument, on account of its portable size, may very readily be taken to the tops of steeples, towers, &c. and is, therefore, extremely well adapted to the uses for which it was intended. ART.

This station was chosen for the purpose of having a view of the Belvidere in Waldershare Park, which cannot be seen from the station of 1787. 3U 2 510 The Account of a Dover Castle. Paddlesworth; about 400 feet from the station of 1787. This new spot was selected, because Hardres Steeple is not visible from the old station. Waldershare; on the Belvidere in the Earl of Guilfords Park. On Ringswold Steeple. On a sand hill near the sea shore, between Deal and Ramsgate: this station is denominated Shore. Near Mount Pleasant House, Isle of Thanet. On a rising ground near Wingham. On Chislet Steeple. In Beverley Park, near;Canterbury. On Upper Hardres Steeple. ART. IIi. Triangles for determining the Distances of the Stations. As the station on the Keep of Dover Castle, in 1787, was directly over the steps of the Turret, a new point was chosen about 6feet from the former, where the instrument could stand conveniently: this new point is about 2,8 feet farther from Folkstone Turnpike, and 1 foot farther from Paddlesworth, than the point marking the old station. From General Roy's Account of the Trigonometrical Survey in 1787, we have Dover Castle from FolkstoneTurnpike 31554.6Jfet from Paddlesworth 42561,2 Now, augmenting those distances in the proportion of 141747 to 1,41753 (see Phil. Trans.

Allington Knoll from Tenterden, according to General Roy's ac-count is 61775, feet, which increased in theproportion Of 141747 to 141753 becomes 61778 feet. The centre of the top of Tenterden Steeple is about 4 or 42 feet farther from Al1ington. Knoll than the point marking the station in 1787; therefore the distance of the centre from Allington Knoll will be 61782 feet, which is used in the following computations,; because, as a flagstaff of moderate height.

Vol. LXXX, page 603). The new point on the Keep is 6 feet north-eastward from the old one, which will subtend an angle at Folkstone turnpike of about 38"; therefore the new station bears 650 52' 8" NE. The bearing of the centre of Tenterden Steeple from Allington Knoll, is nearly the same as that of the station in i 787, or 850 47' E" S W. : but the distances of those stations (Folkstone turnpike and Allington Knoll, see page 232 of the same Volume), from the meridian of Greenwich, and its perpendicular, are augmented in the proportion of 141747 to 141753, for obtaining the distances in the 3d and 4th columns of the following table: Folkstone turnpike being !74,97 and 137220; and Allington Knoll 219935and 144038 feet, respectively, from the meridian, and its perpendicular.

CONCLUSION. THE account contained in the foregoing pages is. presented in its present form, agreeable to the resolutionexpressed in our last communication. It is there stated, or rather implied, that, as materials are collected, details will meet the public eye through the medium of the Philosophical Transactions. The publishing of these particulars at periods not very remote from each other, will prove convenient, as we shall be enabled to communicate many data, which would be necessarily withheld, were these disclosures less frequent. It is on this account, that the particulars in Part the First do not contain the latitudes and: lonrgitudes of the stations, and: objects intersected as sufficient data have not yet been obtained for -making the computations in an unexceptionable manner: but the contents of the Second Part are more complete, that Survey having been carried on in a country sufficiently near the meridian of Greenwich to give the necessary arguments with precision. It is perhaps scarcely necessary to observe, that the design intended to be answered by an admission of the plans of the triangles annexed to this account, isto enable the reader to comprehend withease the state of the operation, and to apply, without difficulty, the materials found in the body-of the work to future Surveys. We have therefore, not attempted to delineate any varieties of ground in the plan of the western triangles (Tab. XI.): and it may, in this place, be proper to mention, MDCCXCVxII. 4 A 50 IDThe Account of a that the ranges of hills expressed in the plan found in our last account, were copied from authorities of the late Major General Roy. The map now given, of the operations performed in Kent (Tab. XII.), has the ground depicted in as accurate a manner as the scale will admit of, Mr. GARDNER, from the minuteness of this Survey, being enabled to do it with accuracy. On adverting to a principal object of this undertaking, that of preparing materials for correcting the geography of the country, it may be expected something should be said, respecting the accuracy of the maps of those counties in which our operations have been carried on. It is almost unnecessary to observe, that great correctness cannot result from the methods commonly taken in large surveys, which are usually made with an apparatus altogether unfit for measuring angles or bases with a sufficient degree of accuracy: and it will evidently appear, on applying the distances given in this, and our former paper, to those maps, that they are, generally, very defective. We must, however, observe, that LINLEY's and CROSSLEY' SMap of Surry, and GARDNER'S Map of Sussex, are the best which have yet fallen under our notice: the first is, in some measure, indebted for its excellence to the Trigonometrical Operation in 1787; and the latter to our own; as the distances between many stations, and the situations of many churches, in the southern, and western parts of Sussex, wvere given to Mr. GARDNER prior to the publication of our last account. The geography of Devonshire and Dorsetshire is found particularly erroneous, as may be easily discovered by an application of our distances to the best maps of those counties. Trigonometrical Survey. 5s N. B. In Tab. XI. the triangles connecting the three principal objects in the Scilly Isles, and the stations from whence they were intersected, are laid down in that detached position to shorten the plan. it.
