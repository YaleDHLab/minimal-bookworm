(327) A Proposal to Noblemen, Gentlemen and others, who are willing to subscribe towards Dr. Morison's New Universal Herbal, ordering Plants according to a new and true Method, never published heretofore. WHereas Robert Morison Dr. of Physick, Botanick to his Majesty, and Professor of that Science in the University of Oxford, hath, by his assiduous and long observation, discover'd a more easie and Scientifical Method of knowing Plants out of the Book of Nature, according to the different forms of their Flowers, Seeas, and Seed-pods, than hath ever yet been published; whereof he hath lately (to the great satisfaction of the Learned, both at home and al ready given an Essay in one of the most difficult Classes: And being now desirous, for the advancing and facilitating that part of Natural History, which hath hitherto been so tedious and discouraging to Students of that Science, for the honor of this our famous Island, and for the Increase of Learning, chiefly in the Universities of Oxford and Cambridge, with all possible speed to finish and put out the whole Work; which, by reason of the excessive charge of Designing, Graving, and Printing, he is not able to perform without the assistance of such Noblemen and Gentlemen, as are desirous to further and encourage this great Work: He therefore doth hereby engage to Noblemen and Gentlemen, or others, who shall be pleased to favour him with one Plate of five pounds, that an Honourable memorial shall be made of them, by engraving their Coat of Arms on their respective Plates (as is already done to others in the foremention'd Essay, as likewise in an hundred Plates and upward, of the five Sections now in hand;) and that a Book shall be deliver'd to each of them consisting of the said five compleat Sections, making 116 Plates cut in Taille douce, containing 1450 Plants, together with their Doctrine, according to his new and truly modelled Method: And at the paying down their five pounds, each one shall receive one of his Specimens Umbellarum, &c. together with a Receipt under the Proposer's hand, obliging him to furnish to each Subscriber or his Assigns the aforesaid five Sections complete, with their Doctrine, they furnishing him with their Coat of Arms blazoned, to be engraven under their respective Coats, And we, whose Names are hereto subscribed, do hereby engage our selves to the said Robert Morison, to pay, upon demand, towards this Work, each of us, the sum of five pounds for one Plate. The (328) The Author finding, that he hath employed almost three years in engraving 108 Plates, the first two years carrying on the Work but slowly, and that partly for want of good and diligent Gravers; and now this last year, finding some Strangers both diligent and able, who joyned with some Artists of our own, we now want only the encouragement of Subscribers, for paying the Painters and Gravers, to finish the whole Work in as short a time as can be possibly allowed: Which makes us carnestly wish, that other Noblemen and Gentlemen, who have not subscribed as yet,would follow the Example of those that have done so and paid; and their respective Coats shall be engraved with the others. Besides, the Proposer herewith signifies to all those that have subscribed to this Work, and have paid their mony, that though he hath already 108 Plates (of the five Sections to be deliver'd) engraven, yet be wants the payment of 20 Plates from so many Subscribers; and that be goes on with the Gravers; but that those who have subscribed long ago, and have not as yet paid, are the cause why the five Sections are not finish't cre now: Wherefore they are desired to pay in their mony with all speed, (as others have done,) according to their Subscriptions. The five Sections are these. PRima Sectio continet Scandentes Bacciferas Edules & non Edules', Scandentes Lactescentes Campanulatas seu Convolvulos; Scandentes Pomiferas Edules & Purgantes.
