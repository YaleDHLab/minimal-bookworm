F. P. S. Read May 15, 1794 Ix the last paper whicll I communicated to the Royal Society oll the doctrille of survixrorships, I concluxled with observing that, as far as my own juclgment could discover, I had then given rules for determining the values of reversions depending upon three lives in every case which admitted of an exact solutiolln and tllat the remaining cases, which were nearly equal in nllmber to those I had already investigated7 involved a corltingericy for svhich it appeared very diflicult to find sllch a general expression as shotlld not render the rules too complicated alld laborious. Since that period I have bestowed much time allsl attention on tlliS subject, and have at length so far succeeded as to give me reason now to hope that it is capable of being elatirely exllausted. It is rlot my presellt design to enter into^the investigation of all the probletus which still remain to be solxled. I .shall laere confine rnyself to a few of the most itnportant, reserving the conclusion of the subject for some fuZure opportunity. The contillgency to wthich I have alltlded in this and nzy former papern as opposing the great difficulty in those problems uZhich I have not yet solved is that of one lDeJsfailing: 223 3 2g Mr. MOROWAN on Survivorships. after another in a given time. It becomes necessary, therefore, previous to any other investigation, to deduce a general method of ascertainin$ such an event, and for this purpose I shall subjoin the followirlg lemma LEM.MA . To determine, from any table of observations, the probability that B the elder dies after A the younger of two lives, either in any given number of years, or during the whole continuance of the life of B. SOLUTION. This event can take place in the first year only by the ex tinction of both lives, A having died first, the probability of which will be expressed by the fraction b-z7}1b a.* In the second year the probability will be increased; for the event may have taken place, as above merltioned, ill the first year, or the lives may have failed in the second year, A having died first; or B may have died in thi5 year, and A in the first year. The expression, therefore, for the second year will be b m (w' m n * a" Jrm-n: n = b x 2 + 2 the third year the probability will be still further increased; for, in addition to the regoing contingencies, the esrent may have taken place -by the extinction of the two lives in tile third year, A having died first; or by tlle extinGtion of the life of A * In order to avoi(l unnecessary repetstions, I have unifiorlmly in this paper preserved ; t:he same sytnbols as in my last paper.-See Phil.

Thus, when the ages of B and A are 92 and 82, the two terms S5 +48 x 8 q_ 48 +4I x 3 form a part of the preceding series, which expresses the probability between two persons aged 93 and 83. * This, and all the other computations in this paper, are deduced from the Northampton Talzle, in l;r. PRICR'S Treatise OI1 Anlluities, Vol. II. p. 36. edit. sth. Mr. MORGAN an Survivorshits.227And in like manner wherl heir ages are 91 and 8s, the three terms 57+525X1§+ &c. form a part of the series svhich denotes the probability betsveen two persons, aged 92 arld 82. By proceeding with tllese operations, a table lnay be forlned for all lives, wlzose common difference of age is the same, with little rnore trotlble than in the single case of tlae two youngest lives. If a table of the probabilities of survivorship be already formed (such as that to which I have referred irl my first paper), the operations in the present case may be exceedingly abridged; and it svill not perhaps be improper here to explain the manner in which tllis is effected. By exchanging the symbols c, dts e, &c. in the solution in my first paper, for their eqllals ms n, o, &c. in the present solution, the series expressing the probability of B's surviving A will become al, X b 2a +m * aZ + + t . a2+ . . . . . . . +t 2a , which exceeds the series expressing the probability of B's dyillg after A by Zb X a'2ra"2ra"' . .. . . + a (or supposing , as in tlle Northampton Table, to be-) by aabX nearly. If, therefore, the givela probability of B's surviving A be denoted by Y, the probability of B's dying after A will be =y_ aabqr, and the probability of A's dying after B will be = a aX ' -Y. The following table has been computed in this manner, excepting the first and the two last divisions, where the difference of age between the two lives is 10, 80, alld go years. In these cases, the probabilities have been deduced from the series in this lerllma, and chiefly with the view of provirlg the accuracy of the table itl sny first paper It is G g 2 SS8 Mr. MORGAN on Surviz>orsDips. however necessuryto observenthat in tlle abovementioned series abx2'+a"+ at>t . . . . . a , thelastternl, (a2 ) by supposing the whole series_ aat,t, is taken at, and therefore the difference betsveell Y and thP probability of B's dying after A, is not exactly expressed above.

As tEre a-pproximatlon appears from the preceding table to be always sufficiently corrects except in the two or three last years of B s life, it is evidentX that if the fractiolls which express the p.roba^bility of l3's dying after A in those yearsa be either confined only to the value of the annuity during that short periodn or be llot ivolved at all in the computation, no gXreat inaccllracy will arise from having recourse to tlie ordi nary method of determining that probability, provided tlae so lutioll be founded on real observations of life, arld not on Mr. De iWOlVRE9S hypothesis. Ill the present problem, when C or A is the oldest of the three lives the abovementiorled fractions either llever enter into the computation, or are confined to t}ae last years of A's life; a<d in both cases they are combinecl 1H l 2 236Mr. MORGAN on SurvivorsZJips.with another contingencyX which necessarily renders theln; of less consequence. The solution, therefore, particularly ila the former cassee becomes very easy v alld even in the latter, by the assistance of the table in lntr first paper,* it becomes eqelvllly simple and correct. But when B is the oldest of tlle tllree lives the above fr'actions are coznbined witll a series wlwich is often of cotlsiderable importatlce, alad consequently the commorl method of solutioll fails in this case. Yet evela 11ere, bF ing possesse(l of the table deduced from *he foregoing lemma it is attended svith little or no dffictalty, and a general rule as short and accurate is obtained as in the other cases.This however will be more satisfactorily proved by the following operations. lst.

ANhen the lives are all equal, the general rtlle decluced either from the series or the foregoing expressions becomes = c_cccs which is kllourn to be the exact value in this case froln selfevident prirlciples. As this method of solution is a)plicable to a great number of problems, I has-e thought it necessary to make the following comptltations, with the view of determining how far it may be depended upon. It is to be observed, that the first series of t _ _ fractions in tlle ab.ove solution, or fi * 0-in . el + 4 + h_st e + 2absr zabsr2 Ac. should have been (according to the lemma), in orcler to a'.b_.m.d {/.b_n Jrd+..".X>z---n.c express -the exact value, zabsr tr 2absrX ' + Ac. and that it is ilepossible to find a gelleral expression arhich shallbe equcal to;this latter series a-lld at the same time fit for use. 'rhis laas render.ed it rlecessary to have recourse to the present approxilnation. But in the first c-olumn of the following exampl-es, each term of tllis 1ast series has been separately computed, so tllat by comparing the values in that and the second coluann an exact idea may be formed of the accu S.^acy cf.the pr.@ceding rulesO Mr. MORGAN on Survivorsibipse9Annuity of £ x<, True value. .1s$8 406 S3° 13.8S, _ _ 1 1. 38s 8.968 , 8.48S _ 9.893, _ _ *647 .o:3,8 .786 1 769 _ 43°7Ages of B. 1S 20 7o 8s 7S 75 65 80 o }S 15 20 7QAp})roximation, *o46 *4C-8 *5S° <tSt782 11.230 _ 8 834! 83379 9 529 e 69 8 _ 1.19q3. _ *z920 1.876 4.671ce 78 7o 81 S S S 5 S 1S 3S 15 1,575 65 8o 1O S 15 20 o 8s 7S 7S 6s 80From these examples it appears, that when C or A is the oldest of the tllree lives, the approximated and the true valtles agree sufficiently near for any useful purpose, and that even when B is the oIdest, tlie diffierence is almost as inconsiderable. It should likewise be observed, that these examples are case$ sn which the diffierence is likely to be greatestn and therefore a nearer approximation need not be required. Botll Mr. SIMP_ SON and myself have given solutions of this problem, and iIl most of the foregoing examples the values derived from them are more correct than could have been expected, but these solutions being foutlded on a wrong hypo!-hesis, are not so corx-st as the presexlt, ese;ept when C is the ol;ieot of the Mr. MORGAN on Sarvlvorships.othree lives, nor are they even more simple, so that it can nowr be seldom Izecessary to have recourse to them. Without the assistance of the preceding lemma, and the computations which haue been just made, it would not have been possible to have ascertained the degree of accuracy of any approximatioll; and therefore were no other end answered by them, this of i:self would be of sufficielat consequence to deserve the time and labour svhich I 11ave bestowed upDn this subject. But it will appear, in the solution of some of the succeeding problems, tilat the use an(l application of this lemma, and especially of the table deduced frol:n it, are mucll more extensive arld im portaxlt.

This rule is self-evident, and proves the truth of tlle foregoing investigations. The solution of this problem may also be derived from the second problem in this paper, ancl the third problem in my papercommunisated ill theyear z788.$ In other words, "the cc value of S in -the present case is equal to the difference be;ss tween its value after the death of A arld B, provided B* Phil.

LXXVIII. p. 347, Mr. MORGAN on S1lrazzworships1476; shollld die before A, and the value of an annuity eqllal to sc the interest of S during the life of C after A, provided A {' should survive B." Let the first of these values be denoted by W, and the second by X, and the required value will be a Wf S rrl X X. When the three lives are equal, the lralue of the reversion evidently becomes _ s 2r t X V-L, which expression may be easily derirred from either of the rules given above, or immediately from the series themselves. Having given so many examples of the accuracy of the rules in the first and second problems, it becomes unnecessary to add any filrther examples in regard to the two foregoing problems, as the solutiorls of the latter are derived from those of the former, and consequently are equally correct in all cases. PROBLEM V. To find the value of a given sum payable on the decease of B and C, should their lives be the last that shall fail of the three lives A, 13, alacl Cs SOIsU Tl-ON. In the first year the given sum can be received only provided the three lives shall have failed, and the life of A have been the first that became extinct. Il1 the second and following years it may be received provided either of fotlr events shall have happened: lst, If all the three li?es shall have failed in that year, A dving first. 2dly, If A shall have died in any of the-foregoing years, and B arld C both died in that t48Mr. Mo RGAN on Srvivorships.year. sdly, If B and A shall have-both died in the foregoing years (Bdyinglast),and-Cdied in tllatyear. 4thly, If Cand A shall have both died in the foregoing years (C dying last), alld B died in that year.

If B and C are botla of them older b than A, and alsn are nearly of the same age, this general rule will be sufficiently correct.

I have also unifornlly supposed the life of B to be older than that of A, and of consequence the approximated value always errs in excess; if the life of A had been the older of the tvvo, it vYould have been found to have erred in defect, and nearly to the same amotlnt. But as, in this latter ca$e, the value of the reversion is grvater Mr. MORGAN on SurvivorshlYs.than when B is the older life, the error nlust necessarily bear a less proportion to the whole value than it does in the preceding examples. With regard to the fifth problem, the error in some cases is greater ill others less thaIl in the present problem. If B and C are botll olcler than A it will be nearly twice as great. If one is ol?cleAr and the otller youngerS it will be altogether inconsiderable; for the fractions rfhich express tIle probability of tle c1der of B and C dying after A will be as much above the truth, as the other fraciiolls expressing tlne probability that the yo;Xager of these two lines die after A wrill be below it, and thus tlle errors of one correct those of the otlaer, and render the computation almost perfecsly accurate.
