VII. A Letter from Mr. Christ. Hunter, to Dr. Mortimer, Secr. R. S. serving to accompany a Copy of an antient Roman Inscription at Rochester in Northumberland, and two others at Risingham. Worthy Sir, Durham, Sept. 9. 1744. K I N D Providence enabling me to outlive such Members of the Royal Society I have had the Happiness to correspond withal, Dr. Read Nov. 8. 1744. (a) I have seen this of our Horse-Muscles in Ponds here in England. C. M. X [160] Dr. Lister, Dr. Woodward, and the much respected dear Mr. Gale, I make bold to address the following Inscriptions to the honourable Society by your Hands. A Transcript of the first Inscription, sent to me six Months ago, was copied by a Person of too narrow Judgment to be depended upon; which obliged me to take a Journey to Rochester, to be exact in every Circumstance relating to the same (a): The Stone was found erected upon two Supporters, and discovered last Year in the midst of a Heap of Rubbish, and the Inscription intire to the last Line, where the Name of the Praefectus is visibly obliterated, in some ensuing Reign. The two following (b) I took out of the Earth at Risingham, another Roman Fort, eight Miles South from Rochester upon the Banks of Reed's Water mentioned by Mr. Camden: They are both Altars broken, the first falling from the Top of the highest Wall of a Dwelling-house deserted above fifty Years; the two initial Letters of the third and fourth Lines broken off; as I V L I U S, L I V I V S, L I B I V S, L I C I V S, or L I D I V S. The other is upon the Margin of Mr. Warburton's Map of Northumberland, I fear, omitted by Mr. Horsley in Britannia Romana among his Sculptures; but find it in pag. 240. of his Observations, so quite different from my Copy. I am, Good Sir, Your most obedient humble Servant, Christopher Hunter. (a) See TAB. II. Fig. 2. (b) See TAB. II. Fig. 3 and 4. VIII. COS~IIII~PROCOS~PP~C~ Fig. n. p. 238.
