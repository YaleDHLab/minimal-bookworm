This repo contains plain text files from the Philosophical Transactions--the great early journal of natural philosophy in England--from roughly the years 1665-1869, generously provided in xml format via Jstor's Early Journal Content project: http://about.jstor.org/service/early-journal-content. The EJC directory of the Philosophical Transactions is large--it contains roughly 40 gigabytes of xml, page images, and pdf files. To make this data more manageable for text processing, I've parsed this xml, performed minimal text clean up, and posted the results in this repo.
