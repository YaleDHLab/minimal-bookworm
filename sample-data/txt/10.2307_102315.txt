(310) III. An Account of a Stone of the Bladder, which weighed 51 Ounces, or Three Pounds Three Ounces, and a Stone out of the Bladder successfully,which adhered to it. By Dr. Charles Preston. IN the Hospital at Paris called, L'Hopital de La Charite, there is preserved, amongst the great number of Stones, Extracted from the Bladder, by the Operation of Lithotomy, one of a prodigious bigness, weighing about Fifty one Ounces, which makes Three Pounds and Three Ounces; it was taken from one of the Religious Brothers, in the House who attends the Sick, in the Month of June 1690. but he Dyed in the Operation; for the Stone being so big, it could not be Extracted till after his Death, it is kept as a great Curiosity, with an Inscription upon it in French, as follows: Pierre pesant 51 onces qui font 3 Livres 3 onces. Qui a este tire dans cet hopital: au Mois De Juin, 1690. et que l' l'on conserve dans le convent. In the Month of June, 1696. while I was at Ghent attending his Majesty's Hospital, there happened a very singular Case in the Operation of Lithotomy, viz. a Stone adherent to the bottom of the Bladder; this was found by one Monsieur Parsaim Lithotomist of the Place, who when he made the Operation could not Extract the Stone, but was obliged to leave his Patient in that Case, there followed an Imposthume, so that eight Days after, he Extracted it with great ease. The next Day he shewed me the Stone (as also to most of the Chyrur(311) Chirurgions in the Hospitals) to which the Fibres by which it was tyed were yet adherent, and could easily be observed by the naked Eye, without the help of a Microscope, so that I could not question any thing as to the matter of Fact. All those that I had occasion to converse with of Lithotomy, while at Paris, deny the Stone is adherent to the bottom of the Bladder, and that they never observed the same; and I do not remember of any Author that writes of it, so that it seems to be a Case altogether new.
