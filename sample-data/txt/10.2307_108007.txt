549 ] XXIII. Observations of the Comet of Encke, made in June 1832. By THOMAS HENDERSON, Esq., His MAJESTY'S Astronomer at the Cape of Good Hope. Communicated, by Command of the Lords Commissioners of the, Admiralty, by Captain BEAUFORT, R.M, F.R.S., Hydrographer to the Admiralty. Received May 17,-Read May 24, 1833. THE following observations (excepting those with the transit instrument,) were made with a circular micrometer, constructed by SIMMs, and applied to an achromatic telescope of DOLLOND, forty-five inches in focal length, and three and a half inches aperture, furnished with a portable equatorial stand, which can be adjusted to any latitude. By means of the horary and declination circles, and the difference of right ascension and declination betwixt the comet and the nearest bright star, the telescope was lreadily pointed to the comet's place; but when the comet got to the southward of the zenith, and was near the meridian, the equatorial apparatus became useless, as its supports came in the way of the telescope: the telescope was then pointed to the comet according to the best estimate which the eye could make of its place in the heavens relatively to the neighbouring stars. The instrument was placed either at one of the windows of the Observatory building, or out of doors in a corner sheltered from the wind, where the best view of the quarter of the heavens where the comet was situated could be obtained. The magnifying power employed was thirty-two, and the radius of the ring was found to be 1015 seconds of arc. The transit instrument by DOLLOND is neatly ten feet in focal length, and the object-glass is five inches in diameter. For observing the comet, an eye-glass, magnifying eighty-eight times (the lowest power which it possesses), was used. June 2nd.-The times are reckoned according to the chronometer, French, No. 975, which was gaining 134 seconds per diem on mean solar time: 91, 441 12s by the chronometer corresponded to 17h 22m 6S mean time. MDCCCXXXIII. 4 B 550O MR. HENDERSON ON THE COMET OF ENCKE. The comet was first perceived about 16h 54m mean time, when it had attained an altitude of 6j0 above the horizon, the sun being then 25 below the horizon. It was seen at once on directing the telescope to the position indicated in the Ephemeris. Comet minus Star. Ingress. Egress. _ ,R. Declination.

HENDERSON ON THE COMET OF ENCKE. 555 of the tran'sit -telescope was bmade by the assistant astronomer, Lieutenant W. MEADOWS, R.N. Not the slightest illumination could be permitted: the whole room had to be darkened to allow the comet being seen. The wires of the transit instrument were completely invisible. The comet was not perceived till it had entered the field of view. h m s At 16 26 12 it was estimated that the comet was in the middle of the field of view. At 16 30, 18 the preceding edge of the comet passed out of the field. At 16 30 30 the whole was gone. The telescope was set to 620 48' of south declination, and the comet passed along the middle of the field. The correction of the transit instrument for its deviation from the meridian, at the comet's parallel, was 1 1 second additive; and the time employed by an equatorial star in passing from the middle wire till its disappearance from the field is 126 9 seconds of sidereal time, for the eye-glass which was used. The comet was not seen in the telescope of the mural circle. Comet minus Star. Ingress. Egress. AR.

The comet was not detected till it was considerably advanced in the field of the telescope. Time by transit clock. h m s 22 38 35. Comet's centre was estimated to go out of the field. 22 39 4. A star of the 8th magnitude went out of the field. 22 39 32. Another of the same magnitude went out. The comet was two or three minutes to the south of the first star. The transit clock was im 173,5 fast of sidereal time; and the correction of the instrument and the distance of the extremity of the field from themiddle wire were the same as stated yesterday. The comet was seen still more faintly in DOLLOND's telescope with the circular micrometer; but owing to its faintness, and the passing clouds, it was impossible to make any observations. It is to be regretted that the two stars seen in the transit telescope were not identified and observed at the proper season, as they would have afforded an approximation to the comet's declination. It is likely that they will still be observed. June 29th.-I suspected that I saw the comet in DOLLOND'S telescope; but so extremely faint that any attempt at observation was hopeless. Clouds at meridian transit. July 6th.-The comet was not visible in the transit telescope at its meridian passage, though the sky was clear. It was no more looked for.

For the observations of that and subsequent days, the effect of refraction has been disregarded, as insensible. The sign + denotes the comet to be more advanced in right ascension than the star, or to the northward of it; the signthe contrary. From the observations, the following positions of the comet, cleared of refraction and parallax, have been computed. They are therefore the apparent geocentric places of the comet. No. Date.
