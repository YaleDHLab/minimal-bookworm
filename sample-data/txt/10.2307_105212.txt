[811] XCVIII. Some Observations upon the Agaric, lately applied after Amputations, with regard to the determining its Species. By Mr. William Watson, F. R. S. THE agaric lately applied' as a styptic after amputations, and which has been brought from France, I do not believe to be the common agaric of the oak, as has been imagined by the French surgeons. What is called the common agaric is a parasitical plant, found growing upon the oak, and upon several other trees; and is denominated by Caspar Bauhin, Fungus in caudicibus nascens, unguis equini figura; of which touchwood or spunk, and the amadoue ordinaire of the French, is usually prepared. I think it impossible, by any process, to prepare from the common agaric a substance perfectly similar to the French agaric, which exactly answers the description, which Breynius gives of the Fungus coriaceus quercinus haematodes, and of which we find the following * account in the Ephemerides naturae curiosorum. `` In medio quercus, `` says that author, medullae velut subucula circum`` volutus, inventus est: tener erat, mollis, flexilis, `` planus, nonnihil rugosus, ea longitudine et lati`` tudine, ut colobium ex eodem commode conficere `` licuisset: colore pallido ad flavum nonnihil ten`` dente; itemque substantia, tractatione, et figura * An. 4, et 5. Obs. 150. 5 K 2 ``alutae Read Dec. 5, 1754. [812] `` alutae ex pelle caprina confectae similior quam `` ovum ovo, nisi quod crassior, materia minus com`` pacta; intus praeterea passim duriuscula & rotunda `` tubercula, in manus magis quam in oculos inter`` currentia occultante. Initio gustatus vis statim `` quaedam attractiva apparebat. Reperitur et in aliis `` arboribus.'' Breynius further says, that this vegetable has been recommended as a most excellent remedy to stop the bleeding at the nose. Mr. Ray, in his Synopsis stirpium Britannicarum, upon the authority of the late Dr. William Sherard, says, that this Fungus coriaceus quercinus haematodes is found upon putrid oaks in Ireland, where it is called oak-leather; and that the country people there collect and preserve it to dress ulcers with. Dr. Sherard makes no doubt but that it may be found in England; and Mr. Ray had even some sent him from the late Dr. Eales in Hertfordshire. Dr. Richardson, in Yorkshire, found it growing upon the ash; and Dr. Dillenius further observes, that in Virginia it is used as leather, to spread plaisters upon; and that, besides its being a soft substance, sitting easy upon the afflicted part, it has a healing property. Thus much I thought proper to lay before the Royal Society, in order that those members of it, who correspond with the French surgeons, may make some further inquiry into the nature, as well as the preparation, if any, of this useful vegetable.
