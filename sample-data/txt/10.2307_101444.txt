Some Anatomical Observations of Milk found in Veins, instead of Blood; and of Grass, found in the Wind-pipes of some Animals. A curious Person wrote not long since from Paris, that there they had, in the House of a Physician, newly open'd a Mans Vein, wherein they found Milk, instead of Blood. This being imparted to Mr. Boyle at Oxford, his Answer was, That the like Observation about white Blood, had been made by a Learned Physician of his acquaintance, and the thing being by him look'd upon as remarkable, he was desirous to have it very circumstantially from the said Physitian himself, before he would say more of it. The next Moneth may bring us in this Account. The other Particular, mention'd in the Title of this Head, came in a Letter, sent also by Mr, Boyle, in these words: I shall acquaint you, That two very Ingenious Men, Dr. Clark, and Dr. Lower, were pleas'd to give me an account of a pretty odde kinde of Observation: One of them assuring me, That he had several times, in the Lungs of Sheep, found considerable quantity of Grass in the very Branches of the Aspera A teria: And the other relating to me, That a few Weeks since, He, and a couple of Physicians, (101) tians, were invited to look upon an Ox, that had for two or three days almost continually held his Neck streight up, and was dead of a Disease, the Owner could not conjecture at; whereupon, the parts belonging to the Neck and Throat, being open'd, they found, to their wonder, the Aspera Arteria in its very Trunk all stuff'd with Grass, as if it had been thrust there by main force: which gives a just canse of marvelling and inquiring, both how such a quantity of Grass should get in there; and how, being there, such an Animal could live with it so long.
