[ 661 ] XXIII. Researches into 'the Chemical Constitution of Narcotine, and of its Products of Decomposition.-Part III. By AUGUSTUS MATTHIESSEN, F.R.S., Lecturer on Chemistry in St. Bartholomew's Hospital. Received February 18,-Read March 18, 1869. IN Part II. of this investigation, carried out in conjunction with Professor FOSTER, it was stated that when narcotine is heated for some time with strong hydrochloric acid a new base was formed, which we called methyl-normal-narcotine, or methyl-nornarcotine, being derived from narcotine by replacing two atoms of methyl by two of hydrogen. In continuing the research into this subject, it has been observed that when narcotine is heated with hydrochloric acid, for only a short time, one atonm of methyl is replaced by hydrogen; and further, that when narcotine is heated with fuming hydriodic acid, three atoms of methyl are replaced by three of hydrogen, thus forming two other bases, the description of the preparation and properties of which form the subject of this Memoir. 1. On the Action of Hydriodic Acid on Narcotine. When narcotine is heated with fuming hydriodic acid, iodide of methyl is evolved, and on investigating the residue it was found to consist of the iodide of a new base. To prepare this the following method was emyloyed: fuming hydriodic acid (made by converting iodine into hydriodic acid by sulphuretted hydrogen, evaporating the solution, and, when cold, saturating it with gaseous hydriodic acid) is made to act on narcotine in a retort at the boiling-point of the mixture, when iodide of methyl is immediately given off and a tarry mass left in the retort, which is chiefly the iodide of the new base. In two experiments made with 50 grms. of narcotine, 45-7 and 46-2 grms. of iodide of methyl, and in a third experiment with 100 grins. of narcotine, 91 8 grms. of iodide of methyl, were obtained, 51'5 grms. and 103 1 grms. being the theoretical quantities required for the following reaction:C22 H23 NO7 + 3HI =C19 H17 NO7 + 3CH3 1. If the reaction C22 H23 NO7 + 2HI C20 H19 NO7 + 2CH3 I took place, the theoretical quantity of iodide would only be 34'3 grms. and 6817 respectively. All endeavours to obtain the base in a state fit for analysis have been fruitless, owing to its rapidly oxidizing when exposed to the air; to establish its composition the followMDcccLIxx. -4 T 662 DR.

After distilling off the iodide of methyl, the contents of the retort were thrown into water, the free acid neutralized by carbonate of sodium, and then water added till all the iodide was dissolved. The iodide is much more soluble in a neutral solution than in an acid one. To the solution of the iodide hydrochloric acid is added until no further precipitate takes place; this precipitate consists chiefly of the chloride of the new base. The chloride is filtered off and redissolved in water (for it behaves like the chloride of methyl-nornarcotine, being far more soluble in pure than in acidulated water), and reprecipitated with hydrochloric acid. This operation is repeated until the precipitate contains no longer any iodine. The analysis of this chloride, dried first over lime and sulphuric acid, and then in the water-bath, gave the following results. The substance was burnt with chromate of lead and oxygen. The chlorine determinations were made in the usual manner. 1. 0 5073 grm. substance gave 1-0387 grm. carbonic acid and 0-2108 water.

The chloride when first precipitated is almost white, but soon becomes slightly yellow. It is amorphous. The base itself, when newly precipitated, is iiearly white, but as soon as it is exposed to the air it becomes almost black; it is soluble in carbonate of sodium and caustic soda, potash or ammonia, slightly soluble in hot alcohol, quite insoluble in ether, and nearly so in water. All endeavours to obtain it or its salts in a crystalline state have hitherto failed. The base may be called normal narcotine, or, shorter, nornarcotine, as it contains, in all probability, normal meconin combined with cotarnimide. Thus in Part I. page 366 of this Memoir, carried out in conjunction with Professor FOSTER (Philosophical Transactions, 1863), it is stated that cotarnine may be written H H (C11 H9 02)"'0, which is cotarnimide, (C11 H9 O)2YIJ CH3 }N H }N, DR.

On the Action of Hydrochloric Acid on Narcotine. When narcotine is heated with hydrochloric acid for about two hours, chloride of methyl is evolved, and on examining the residue it will be found to contain the chloride of a new base. The best method of its preparation is as follows :-Narcotine (say 100 grms.) is placed in a large flask with a quantity of strong hydrochloric acid (500 cub. centims.) with a little paraffin, and heated on a water-bath for the space of three to four hours; much chloride of methyl is given off, and there remains behind in the retort the chloride of a new base. The reaction which takes place is simply that one atom of methyl in the narcotine is replaced by one of hydrogen, thus: C22 123 NO7 + HCi C21 H21 NO7 + CH3 Cl. To obtain the base from the chloride, the following process was adopted: as soon as the contents of the flask are cold they are neutralized by carbonate of sodium; this salt is then added in excess, which, dissolves any methyl-nornarcotine, or nornarcotine which may have been formed during the reaction, and leaves the new base and any undecomposed narcotine. This may be separated by caustic potash, in which the new base is readily soluble, narcotine being insoluble in that reagent. The potash solution is acidulated with hydrochloric actd, and the base precipitated fractionally by carbonate of sodium. I The solution in which the base is suspended may be heated to 500 C. (but not higher, otherwise the base is apt to get sticky), when it filters readily. The separation from narcotine may also be accomplished by alcohol, in which the new base is easily soluble. On analyzing the base the following results were obtained. It was dried in a Leibig's tube, first at 50? C., and then at 100? C. 4 T2 664 DR. A. MATTHIESSEN ON THE CHEMICAL CONSTITUTION OF NARCOTINE.

Its salts, like those of other bases derived from narcotine, are, as far as they have been prepared, amorphous. The base may be called dimethylnormal-narcotine, or, shorter, dimethyl-nornarcotine. The rational formula of this base is either H }N CH3 }N (C11 H9 02)"' (C11 H19 O)"' (C8 H ) (C8 14 O)Iv f (CH3)2 H }03 CH03 03 if narcotine be Gi3 }N (C11 H9 02)"' (C8 H40 )f (CH3)2 H }03. Further experiments will show which is the correct one: in the annexed Table the properties and reactions of the narcotine bases are given side by side. Neither of the above bases have any marked physiological effects; for in working with them, as well as in taking grain-doses, no ill effects have been observed. It is worthy of notice that the taste of the chlorides varies so markedly by the replacement of one atom of methyl by one of hydrogen.
