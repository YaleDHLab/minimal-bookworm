An Observation by Mr. William Watson, F. R. S. of Hydatides voided per Vaginam. A Gentlewoman aged about 48, the Mother of many Children, after a Respite of Six Years, had, in November 1739. the Symptoms of Conception, which left her in February; from which time to the End of March, she every Night discharged per Vaginam Uteri a considerable Quantity of Blood; and, not perceiving an Increase in her Belly, nor (which in Z z z z 2 Cases [712] Cases of Conception is the Pathognomonic Sign of something preternatural) her Breasts, she concluded her Menses were leaving her at their usual Period. But, upon the First of April, being taken with great Pains in her Back, and having other Symptoms antecedent to Delivery, there came away, at short Intervals, a very large Number of Hydatides, of all the intermediate Sizes, from a Nutmeg to a Pin's-head, some filled with clear, others with bloody Lymph; all of them propagated in the manner of a Cluster of Grapes from a spongious Substance, answering the Purposes of a Placenta. After the Discharge of these, in a few Days she recovered her accustomed Health. Upon boiling some of these Hydatides, they appeared like the Ovary of a boiled Hen, with this Difference; in the Hen, the Contents of the Ova concrete; in this Case, not; but the Transparency was changed to the Colour of Bile diluted with Water.
