All these observations were made by time kept by G R A H A M 'S time-piece, with a gridiron pendulum, rectified occasionally by equal altitudes of the Sun, corrected agreeably to the tables of M. DE LA LANDE, for the alteration of the declination in the intervals of corresponding observations. S A M U E L H O L L A N D. * This satellite in emerging was in conjunction with another, which occasioned such a deception as to render this observation uncertain about 20 seconds sooner than what is marked here.
