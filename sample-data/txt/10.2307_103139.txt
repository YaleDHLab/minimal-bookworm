This is known from the last, in having smaller Flowers, yet larger and round bearded Leaves. 59 Jagged Oriental Figwort. Scrophularia Oriental. supina, folio varie lacerato Nobis. This branches and spreads much near the Ground; its Leaves thick and differently cut; the Flowers and Seed-Vessels like the Common, but less; neither grows it upright and spiked, but procumbent and racemose. 60 Rough huskt Oriental Campion. Lychnis Oriental. fl. albente, bifido, calycibus pulchre rugosis Nobis. The Leaves not unlike our common white Campion, but lefs; its Flowers white above, and underneath of a palish green, deeply cut in. These are set in a fine streakt Husk, roughest near the Flower, which swell into a rugged Seed-Vessel. This and the last, two elegant Plants, I saw in 61 (417) in Flower about the beginning of October 1710. in her Grace the Dutchess of Beaufort's Garden at Chelsey. China Schunda, ot Thorney Nightshade. Schunda Chinensis fol. pannoso minore Nobis. Solanum incanum Chinense, minus spinosum, floribus parvis fere umbellatis Pluk. Tab. 62. fig. 1. Ray 3. p. 352. 14. Its small thick woolly Leaves very little thorney or waved, distinguish it from others. I first received this from China, and communicated it to Dr. Plukenet: It Flowers and Fruits every Year in Fulham and Chelsey Gardens. 62 China Sumach. Rhus Chinensis latifolia, pinnis alatis Nobis. Rhus quinquefolia Sinarum lactescens, rachi medio alata, folijs molli hirsutie pubescentibus Pluknet. Amalth. 138. pl. 5. These Leaves resemble our Ash, but are broader and deeper serrated, very soft underneath: Each Stalk is composed of three or four Wings, oftner than two; the Stalk welted, but more eminently towards the tip Leaf. Mr James Cunningham, a very Curious Naturalist and Surgeon, brought me large Specimens of this with ripe Berries on it from China, which I gave to the Right Reverend my Lord Bishop of London, who has raised several small Trees from them, and with whom they now grow. 63 Chusan Musk-Mallow.

D. 1673. from the Cape of Good Hope, given him by Dr. Herman, which Tho. Bartholine, that Curious Physitian and Anatomist, has given the Figure of, in his Acta Medica Hafniensia. Its an ever-green Shrub, with deep dented Leaves, and has been a long standard in Chelsey Garden, where it Flowers and Seeds yearly about Christmas Mr. Cuningham brought me the first Specimen of this near 20 Years since, in his return from the Cape of Good Hope.

The Leaves are round, stiff, hairy and lightly crenated; the Flowers fresh coloured, the two upper Petala streak'd with red, and larger than the 3 below. Dr. Paul Herman, that celebrated Professor in Botany and Physick, has used these Leaves in Glysters, against the Cholick, Stone, and difficulty of Urine, with good success. 71 Hermans Curl-leaved Cape Tree Cranes-bill.

Geranium Africanum Malvae folio, odore rad. Cyperi longi Hort. Bosian. This differs from the last, in having curled or crumpled Leaves, with 6 or 7 smaller Flowers growing together from one bottom. 72 Cape Cranes-bill, with Leaves like Ladies-mantle. Ray 1897. Geranium Africanum Alchimillae hirsuto folio, floribus albidis Hort. Lugd. Batav. 283. Fig. Geranium African. Alchimillae folio maculoso & piloso, floribus ochroleucis rostris cernuis Hort. Bosian. Its Leaves hairy and round, somewhat cut in, with a blackish Circle in the middle; the Flowers pale, small, and 5, 6 or more in an umbel-like tuft. 73 Cape Cranes-bill with Columbine Leaves.

From a knotty Fibrose Root, rises knobby Stalks a foot or higher, with divided Columbine Leaves; at the top grow tufts of yellowish, and sometimes blush Flowers; which after Sun set smell very sweet till next Morning, as many others of this kind do. We are highly obliged to that Curious Botanist Dr. 74 Herman, (421) Herman, for the Discovery of all these beautiful Cranesbills,which of late Years have been the greatest Ornaments in our finest Gardens, viz. at Hampton Court, Kensington, Fulham, Oxford, Chelsey, Hoxton, Enfield, Mitcham, &c.

From a thick stringy matted Root this rises 3 or 4 foot high, with thick shining notch'd Leaves, very green above; its Flowers 5 leaved, of a whitish or pale Green. At the Cape it grows 7 foot high, in watery~ Grounds and by River sides, flowering in October. 77 Cape (422) Cape Spindle-wort with Rosemary Leaves. Ray 3. p. 527. 6. Tetragonocarpos Africana fruticans, folijs longis & angustis H. Amst. Vol. 2. p. 205. Fig. 103. It rises about a foot high, each Root dividing into divers Stalks, with long thick green Leaves not unlike Rosemary; at the top grow several yellowish Flowers of 4 or 5 petals each. The Fruit square and winged: It Flowers about Michaelmas in Fulham and Chelsey Gardens. 78 S E C T. VI. A M E R I C A N Plants. Dwarf American Starwort, with Savory Leaves. Aster pumilus Americanus Satureiae folijs. This grows not above a Yard high; from one stem it branches towards the top into a bushy tuft of pale blew Flowers, the lower Leaves are long and narrow, and those about the Flowers very small and slender. It stands out all the Winter, flowring in October. 79 Parkinson's small floured white Virginia Starwort. Aster Virginianus angustifolius serotinus, parvo albente flore Park. 132. 19. & 1676.

This agrees pretty well with Parkinson's Description and Figure; its Leaves below are long Willow-like, and scarce dented; those at the setting on of the Flower Stalks are mnch less, and those on the Twigs very small. From the bosom of these little Leaves, the Flowers grow spicated in a loose tuft, of a pale blewish white, each composed of 8 or 10 small Dasie-like Petals, these, if nicely viewed,ending bisid. It Flowers in November, and sometimes till near Christmas, being one of the latest Starworts that Flowers in our Gardens. 80 Orach-leaved Virginia Silver-tufs. Ray 1799. 14.

This is a specious Plant and of a particular Genus or Family; it comes nearest the Sun-Flowers, but with this difference, viz. its Berry-like Seeds grow round the rim of the Flowers, as the others do in the middle. I have therefore chose to distinguish it by the Epithet above, in commemoration of that Patron of Botany, Dr. Uvedale, in whose Garden I have seen two others of this kind from the Cape of Good Hope. 82 American Tree of Life.

This is a singular Evergreen, very frequent in divers Gardens, flowring in April and May, bearing its Cones in August and September. It was first brought into France from Canada in the Reign of Francis the First. Clusius says, he first saw it at Fontainbleau, and from his Figure all other Authors have copied it. Parkinson asserts, that the Leaves taken fasting for a few Days together are very good in a purulent Cough and shortness of Breath. I have heard it has been success83 full (424) full in Agues used Poultise-wise, or by wearing it in the Shoes. Virginia Sumach by some Buckshorn. Ray 1591. 2. Rhus Virginianum C. B. pin. app. 517. Sumach seu Rhus Virginiana Park. 1450. Fig. 2. This grows in divers Country Gardens about London to a midling Tree; it differs from the European Sumach, in having longer and narrower Leaves; the first Branches are very soft and velvety, like the Horns of a young Deer, for which reason its call'd Buckshorn by the Country People. The Root or Stalks broken yields a Milk, which smells Resinose, and becomes a hard Gum, which is a great Astringent and Cures the Tooth-ach, as Mr. John Smart, a Surgeon, who liv'd in those Parts informs me. The Pulp of the Fruit and its outer Skin, which is very red, have both a very grateful acidity, of which Mr John Banister, a very Curious Naturalist, and one who long resided in Virginia, says, they make Vinegar of it there, and use it to season their Meat. 84 Great Virginia Cockspur Haw.

The Leaves of this Tree are as large, and not unlike our Sorbus Torminalis, or wild Servise, and the Fruit as big but Scarlet; its Branches are guarded with strong Thorns resembling a Cocks-spur. It Fruits yearly in Chelsey Garden, where it has been a long Standard, and is now as large as a Cherry-tree. 85 Carolina Poyson Root.

Under this Title Dr. Plukenet has given it a very good Figure, yet I cannot believe it to be the Saamouna Brasiliensium, since this is not a Siliquose Tree, neither hath it a thorney swelled Trunk. I shall be more particular in the Description of all its Parts, when I give you (as I intend) the Figure of it, with its Fruit. I have seen this both with Mr. Darby and Mr. Fairchild. Gardiners at Hoxton, with whom it has flowred and set for Fruit. Canada Fox-glove Climer. Ray 1768. 1. Bignoma Amer. Fraxini folio, fl. amplo phaeniceo I. R. H. 133. Clematis Contarini.

It would be needless here after the quotation of so many Authors, to give its Description; it may suffice to let you know, that its long hollow Orange Flowers with Ash-like Leaves, but deeper jagged, distinguish it from others of this Family. I take the two Mexican Tecomaxochit's Recchi, p. 408. & 409. to be of this Species, but neither of them this very Plant, altho' the last is somewhat like it, and Dr. Plukenet makes it the same. We have an old Tree of this of near 30 Years standing, in Chelsey Garden, which of late has annually flowered with us. The Mother Plant of this, and the first in England, Mr. Kilbank has N n n for8 (426) formerly shewed me in the Lord Roberts his Garden against the Ferry, to whom both he and his Father were Gardiners.

This differs from the Oriental Plane in having its Leaves hoary and less jagged, with Fruit smaller and not so rough. Mr. John Tradescant first brought this into England from Virginia, a little before the Year 1640. since which time it has been much increased, and makes a very Ornamental shady Tree, interspers'd between Horse-Chestnuts and Limes, to whose Magnitude it commonly grows. 88 III.
