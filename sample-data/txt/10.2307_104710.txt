[605] III. An Account of the same, by Jo. Freeman Esq; F. R. S. AS I passed thro' the Mews To-day, a little before 1 o' Clock, I felt a Shock like an Earthquake, and I thought I heard a hollow deep Noise. Several Women thereabouts came running out of their Houses much terrified. Read Feb. 8. 1749-50. At Leicester-House they were apprehensive the Foundation was giving Way, and were going to send immediately for the Surveyor. All the Way in my Return home, I saw many Groups of People together, and discoursing upon this Shock that had just happen'd; some imagining it was occasion'd by some Houses being blown up in Gold-Lane, where there was a great Fire, and others from some Powder-Mills blowing up; the same thing having been observed about 9 Years ago, from the like Accident at the Mills at Hounslow. If neither of these Causes appear, it can be no other than an Earthquake. IV.
