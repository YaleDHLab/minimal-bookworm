De Lisle, Astronomer Royal at Petersburgh, containing his Observations of the Eclipses of Jupiter's Satellites from July 10th, 1726, to April 12th, 1728, taken at that Place. Petersburgh, July 9/20, 1728.

The following were made with common Telescopes of 13, 15, 20 1/2, and 22 Foot; and are very good ones 1726. D. H. ~ ~ What Eclipse. Telescope.
