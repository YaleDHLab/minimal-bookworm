C Xs J 1I. Methods of clearing Equatio ns of quadratic, cubic, quadratocubic, and hzgher Surds. By William Allman, M. D. Com. municated by the Right Hon. SirJoseph Banks, K. B. P. R.S. Read July 8, IS'3. SEVERAL years have elapsed, since my very highly esteemed friend, now Rev. Doctor MOONEY, Fellow of Trinity College, Dublin, presented to the Royal Irish Academy a paper on the Extermination of Radicals from Equations. He has illustrated, by sundry examples, the extermination of quadratic surds. As he has rightly observed, the method is universal. Any number of quadratic surds, independent, or dependent, on each other, may be removed from an equation; because, i. Any quantity, or factor of a quantity, necessarily subjected to the radical sign, is but of one dimension. 2. This quantity or factor being brought to one side of the equation, while the quantities unaffected with it remain at the other, may, by squaring both sides, be freed from the radical sign. 3. By a repetition of these reductions for each remaining independent surd quantity, any number of surd quantities may be converted into rational. Examples. I. Let V>a + Vb + Vc = o: then (2;) Va + V1b=-_ j>/c; and, a + b + 2Vab -c (3;) a+b -c = _ Vab; a + b-c = ab; free from surds. 24 Dr. ALLMAN'S Methods of clearing Equations Of II. Let Va + V/b + Vc + Vd = o; then (2;) a + b+c+ 2Vab+V /ac + 2i/bc=d (3;) a + b + c-d + Vab ---2/Vac 2 Vbc; squared gives, a b+ cd + 4ab+ 4. a + b + c d. Vab~z 4c. a+b+ 2ab _____ (4;) a + b c -d + 4,ab-4cd4 . c+ d-ab.ab; squared, results free from surds. Note, universally: the last two surd factors vanish together. Surds, whose indices are integral powers of 29 may be treated as quadratic surds; and the number of themn, which may be exterminated from any equation, is equally unlitnited. Let 4V/a + 4Vb + c =o: thenr, (2;) Va + Vb + 2 V<sab= i/c (3;) Va+ Vr/b Vc = 2"aV ab d a + b + c + 2Vab 21Vac2V/bc 41Vab. The surds, now-all quadratic, may be thus exterminated: (4;) a+b+c-Vab V/ac+2V/bc za+b+c+ 4ab 4. a + b c. Vab =4c + 4bc + 8cVab.

In like manner may surds of the i6th, 32d, 64th, &c. powers be taken away from any equation. Thq number which may be taken away is unlimited, as the removal of each surd quantity or factor, in all these cases, depends on the principles which direct the solution of simple equations. In the case of cubic surds, the quantity or factor necessarily subjected to the radical sign mnay be of one, or of two dimensions, but not higher: since then, an universal method is knowni for solving quadratic equations, any number of cubic surds, independent, or dependent, on each other, may be removed from an equation. Let 'Va + /Vb + 'V c -o then (2;) a+ b + 3 3Vab + ,33 Vab'= C: therefore, (3;)\/ab +3,Vabt -a-b MDCCCXIV.

But an equation consisting of 3 cubic s.urds only, may be cleared of them without the solution of a quadratic equation, thus: Let k/a + 3j/b 4+ = o: then, (.;) a 4b + 4 3&V' + c3i/ab, -i. e. since 3Va + 3v/b 3= / c, a + b-S `/abc =-c: therefore, (3:) a + b 4c = j\/abc; and, 3 a+b+c3 = *7abc. Anld, universally, an equation consisting of 3 surds only, whose common index is any odd number, may be cleared of them, if we admit the solution of an equation, whose highest dimension is half the index of the surd minus unity. Because in any integral power of a binomial, as the co-effi.cients of terms at equal distances from the extremes are equal, those terms may coalesce, the compound factor being equivalent to a simple one, as may be more fully seen below. To return to cubic surds: if s 41' Vde 4 / v de' = o, then, by the last example, (3;) sI 4t3 de + v'deo, 3stvde. Let lVa + 3V/b +4'V/d +33Ve 0: then, (3;) a +-b + _ + _ _+ t/~d4-k3/e= $ kab . /d + Ve; and, a b+ d + e + 3$ /d e + -3 ?/ de-= 27-ab. d + e+s3Vd'e4+33Vde puta4+b4-d4+e=3r; theti, quadratic, cubic, quadrato cubic, and higher Surds. ? r + i/s e + ' =/ eaab . d + + e Vd +3a bde + /d, i. e. +ddc +der. 3d ' =b . d +. e + 3ab /de+3ab3 /de ; +dct~~~~ r 3O + 5r1 )ut de-ab x, and d e=y; (4) + 6der + 3er Vd e+ 3dr. 3V/de'= o. +Xy +3X +3X.

If another independent cubic surd were added, the equation resulting free from surds would be Of 7 dimensions, or of 8i times the height of the given equation. Uriiversally, if an equation consist of any numbet of indeb pendent surds having a comr-mon index, the equation resulating free from surds will be so many times the height of the given one, as there are units in the common index of the surds raised to the power whose index is the number of independent surds diminished by unity. As the solution of a cubic equation is required for the extermination of some of the higher surds, it may be worth while to shew the connection of the rule, called CARDAN'S, with the extermination above given of cubic surds. If 3/a Vb + 3V./C = 0o then a + b 4= /a as before; or, by substituting x, y, z, for V/a Vb, Vc, respectively, if x y 4x = o, theni X3 +y3 + z = 3Z.

V -s will represent the two impossible roots. If the cubic equation have all its roots possible, the last named expression, as well as _y-z, implies the extraction of the cube root of an impossible binomial; except, however, in this single case, when two of the roots of the cubic equation are equal to each other: then, the solution by the above rule is possible, though all the roots be possible; for then, y = z; and the expressions y and I ri + 2q3, both vanish: then X3 *_ 32X + o3 = , and the values of x, are _ sy y, and y. Since any number, either of quadratic, or of cubic surds, quadratic, cubic, quadrato-cubic, and higher Surds. 29 mnay be exterminated, any number of surds, whose indices are in any manrner compounded of the factors 2 and 3, may also be exterminated from afly equation. It may at present suffice to instance, in surds of the 6th, and in surds of the 9th power. Let 6/a +6V/b +6Vc == o then, as in cubic surds (3;) a* +3a. +3a. Va + i/b +4 vc 6 c; and V3b. l +b.

It will be of 1d dimensions; but may be depressed to one of 9. Instead of continuing the operation to shew this, I refer to the extermination of surds of-the 5th, and of the 7th power, to be given below, for the manner in which some equations, resulting on involution, are depressed. In surds of the 5th power, the quantity or factor, necessarily subjected to the radical sign, may be of 4 dimensions, but not higher: whence, if the solution of any biquadratic equation be admitted, any number of surds of the 5th power may be taken away from an equation; and here it may be observed, that, as to the matter in hand, it is of no importance, whether the biquadratic equation may be solved in possible terms, or not; for the value, in numbers, of any particular quantity, or factor, is not required; it is only required to obtain the quantity, or factor, of a single dimension, in order to deprive it, by involution, of its radical sign. When an equation consists of 3 surds of the 5th power, the biquadratic equation is virtually a quadratic. Let5 a + 5V'b + c/=o * (2;) a +b +5 Va4b+ so SV/a3bls + io'ab + 5 ab4 c; put a + b + c = fn. ? e (i; * ) 5Va~b + m2 5V'3ba + 2 W5/a2b3 + W-/ab4 -m: this, 32 Dr. ALLMAN 'S Methods of clearing Equatzons of multiplied by b3, gives 'Va'b'6 + 2b WVa3bi2 + 2b2 '/Vapb' + bs 5v/ab4 -= bm, a biquadratic equation of the quadratic form, th us, WVa2b8 + bslabt + b .

If a formula for the solution of any equation of 6 dimensions were known, any number of surds of the 7th power might be taken away from an equation: As such a formula, however, is, I suppose, at present altogether unknown, we may be contented with the extermination of 3 surds of the 7th power, which may be accomplished, because, a formula for the solution of cubic equations is known, 3, the index of M\DCCCXIV.

Far greater would be the labour to exterminate 3 surds of the 13th power. Surds of the 1oth power, it must already have sufficiently appeared, may be taken away in any number, according to the principles of extermination of cubic and quadratic surds. It is also sufficiently manifest, that, if an equation, consisting of 8 surds of a certain power (v. g. the 7th), may be cleared of surds, an equation containing X such surds, together wvith any number of other surds whose extermination is unlimited, may be also cleared of surds; and that surds, whose extermi. nation, as to their number, is unlimited, may be exterminated from any equation containing them, however diverse they be from each other. Thus, has been pointed out, the extermination from equations, of surds whose indices do not exceed the number 6, or of any combinations of such surds, in any number; of three .surds, whose common index is either of the prime numbers between 6 and 12, or whose indices are either of these multiplied by any numbers, or powers of any numbers under 6, provided the equation contain no other quantity; also, of two surds, whose common index is, or, whose indices are, as last described, with ana indefinite number of surds of the former description. quadratic, cubic, quadrato-cubic, and higher Sards. 41 It only remains, however, for the complete establishment of thue last observation, to note, that any surds, contained in the denominator of any fractional quantity of -an equation, which cannot be transferred to the numerator, by multiplying both terms by a residual, as some have recommended to be done, may, by multiplying the whole equation by that denominatcr, be transferred to the other quantities, or numerators, of the equation. That observation will then hold of the surds therein named, however they be situated in the equation; whether they be in the numerators, or in the denominators of fractions. P. S. Dr. WARING'S method of taking away surds* is very ingenious. It is however evidently limited by the same postulate, which restricts the application of my general method; viz. to solve an equation of the dimension next lower than the index of the surd, being prime; for this must be effected in order to obtain the imaginary values of the surd as required by his method; and this, and sometimes less than this, is sufficient in mine. e. g. To obtain the imaginary roots of the 5th power of unity' the biquadratic equation 4. a 4.+ a2 . a 4 i = a must be solved. These roots are A ?-'o? and ? V. 10i ZVS, coefficients troublesome enough, especially from their variety, as WARING himself has observed.* V. Meditat. Algebr. Ed. 3. p. ape, Ptob. 26.MDCCCXIV'. G f 0, Dr. ALLMAN's Methods of cleart'ng Equations of The imaginary values of higher surds of prime indices, When found, would be still more complicated: and it is not very qasy to find, for example, the imaginary values of a, sUrd. of the iith power.* * The imaginary roots of the 7th power of unity are, ~~3 3 2 X AV /7 l A/3 -/7 z IV-3 + I /-2 I-:2 2 2 V__-'__ -^ Y7 6 \ /_3 3 \/637+147V-3 p637-147v'-3 Vd '-7V .2 Z + ' -3 3 / -7+21V/-3 I-+ -3 3 / -7-2.IV-3 6 I z 12 z + I/ ~2I+I+V. 3 z 7-21 / ,/ 3-7+-IVt 1 I+V7-23-3+ I-V-3J +16 I-V---/33 / 637I47 -3 l+V/ 637.3.I47V3 2 2 + 7.2 l 1V/_3 3 +-7+Z8/IV+ -3 3 -7-21 V3 tS>6;)6-+ 7+ZLV + 41 I it-2I+ I _2 3 i 7 -2 I /3 3 -7I1 +1 2V3 +~~~~~~~~~~~~ 3 I7+1 +V2-3I A,/ 637+ 147V/-3 l-V-3 3 637-147V/3 as may be found by solving the equation x6+X5+X4 X3+x%+X+I = _. Here, in justice to Dr. WA RI N G, I must observe, that the application of his method to the extermination of the higher surds of prime indices, may, in all cases, be brought within the condition of solving an equation, whose dimension is half the index of the surd diminished by unity. For any equation, of an even dimension, which has the coefficients, at equal distances from the middle, equal, the signs being either alike, or, as they recede from the middle, alternately opposite and alike, may in effect be reduced to half its original dimension. In that case, half of the roots of the equation are the reciprocals, or the negatives of the reciprocals, of the other half. An equation, whose roots shall be the respective sums of these pairs, will be of half the dimension of the proposed equation. Thus, if quadratic,, cubic, quadrato-cubic, and htg'her Surds. 43 The preceding biquad'atic equation is the difference of two squares a4 4 a3 + 9 a4 + a + 1, and 5 d a2: consequently, its quadratic factors will be the sum and difference of tleroots of these squarest viz. a a + 1 o, and a2 __ a + x"'+ax9+bx3+cx7+dx6+mxs+dx4+cx3+bX +ax+ i =; by the combination of corresponding terms, which has, in the preceding sheets, bhcu repeatedly exemplified, and by division of the roots by x, may be obtained, 1 I73 ~ -~+ 1. + d +m X?4 a.

X +l -3 .X . 1 + 3 . X + + I = 0. If this equation Sould be solved, then would Dr. WA , i .'s method serve for the universal extermination of surds of the i ith power. I may also observe, that my method universally holds for exterminating quadrato. cubic surds, without the solution of any higher equation than a quadratic, as may appear from a former example, though the observation was not before made; and, in like manner, that it universally holds for exterminating surds of the 7th power, within the condition of solving a cubic equation. For the resulting equation of six dimensions may be reduced to one of three, independently on the simplicity or composition of the third quantity of a given combination of surds. Thus, if ' Va+7v'b+X7V = -a--b-c 7Vab+ 37Va~b$+ s7Va4 '+ s'VA' + 3'Vatb5+ +Vab6 =: then after multiplying by P, may be obtained this cubic equation, 7Va2b'1^ + bTVab63 + 2b" 7v/o ab6 + . bz+ 7Va6 a . b5. Here, whatever may be the value of c, a and b may be freed from the radical sign of the 7th power, by the solution, first of a cubic, then of a quadratic, equation, and afterwards involution. So that both WA K I N C'S method and mine universally hold, until we arrive at surds of the iith power; and according to mine, three such may be exterminated. Gran 44+ Dr. ALLMAN'S Methods of clearing Equations, &c. 1 = o. These quadratic equations being solved, will give the four roots of the biquadratic, as above. So may be solved any biquadratic equation, the coefficient of whose 4th term is equal to the product of the coefficient of the ed by the square root of the last, the coefficient of the 1st term being unity: and, by the intervention of a cubic equation, any biquadratic may be so transformed.
