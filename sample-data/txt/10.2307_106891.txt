That there have been some, we may admit7 and rather suppose, but we have no particular reason to suspect them to have been -very considerable. And7 after we have shown that a proper motion, in the spots of the belts, of X 16 degrees one wayv or of 117 the other would only occasion an error of S mnutes in-time, we need not hesltate to fix the rotation of the planet Saturn upon its axis at zoh w6' o",4.
