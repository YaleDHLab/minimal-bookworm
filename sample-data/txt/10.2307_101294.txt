An Extract of a Letter, Written from Dantzick to the Honourable R. Boyle, containing the success of some Experiments of Infusing Medicines into humane Veines. MOnsieur Smith, Physitian in Ordinary to this City, having liberty granted him to try an Experiment upon some persons desperately infected with the Poxe, then in the publick Hospital here, adventur'd the opening a Veine, and Infusing some Medicines into the blood; which was tryed upon two persons, whereof the one recover'd, and the other dyed. Yet being since farther encouraged by corresponding with some of the Royal Society in England, about a Moneth since, the said Physitian, together with Monsieur scheffeler, another antient Practitioner in this City, repeated the Experiment by infusing Altering Medicines into the Veines of the right Armes of three persons: the one, lame of the Goute; the other, extreamly Apoplectical; and the third, reduced to extremity by that odd distemper, the Plica Polenica. The Success of this, as Monsieur Hevelius (who was the person only admitted to be present at the operation) informes me, was; That the Gouty man found himself pretty well next day, and shortly after went to work, it being Harvest time, and has (767) has continued well ever since, leaving the Hospital yesterday, and professing himself cured. The Apoplecticall hath not had one Paroxysme since: And the several Sores, which the Plica Polonica had occasioned, are healed; and both these Persons have been able to work any time these three Weekes. Dated August 18. 1668.
