[ 261 ] XIV. Appendix to a paper on the Variations of the Acidity of the Urine in the state of Health. By HENRY BENCE JONES, M.D., M.A. Cantab., F. R. S., Physician to St. George'sHospital. Received May 7,-Read May 24, 1849. On the Influence of Caustic Potash, Tartaric Acid, and Tartrate of Potash on the Acidity of the Urine. IN a paper on the variations of the acidity of the urine in the state of health I have, in the third sectiongiven the effect of dilute sulphuric acid; in this Appendix I purpose to show the influence of other medicines on the variations of the acidity of the urine. ILL (b.) The effect of caustic potash on the acidity of the urine was examined. The caustic potash of pharmacy varying much in its specific gravity from 1060 downwards, and in the proportion of carbonate of potash which it contains, some caustic potash perfectly free from carbonate, and of specific gravity 1072, containing, by Dr. HOFMANN'S analysis, from 6'20 to 6-29 per cent. of potash, was used for the following experiments. It was taken in distilled water. The day before the alkali was begun the variations of the acidity of the urine were first determined for the purpose of comparison. The first day two drachms and a half of caustic potash were taken; the same quantity the second day, and the third day three drachms were taken. Thus eight drachms were taken in three days; and the following day, when no caustic potash was taken, the variations of the acidity of the urine were again determined for the purpose of further comparison. (20.) The day previous to the alkali. Breakfast on eggs, meat, coffee and bread, at 8h 5m A.M. Dinner on mixed diet at 6h P.M. Water passed at 7 1 5m A.M. was thrown awayh m Spec. gr.

The following day breakfast was as before, at 8h ltm A.m. Dinner at 61h p.M. One drachm and a half of liquor potasshe was taken in distilled water between 1 Ih A.M. and lh P.M., and another drachmri between 31 and 3 h 30' P.M., both in as little water as possible. h m Spec. gr.

It follows therefrom that liquor potassum, taken in large doses, produces a decided effect in diminishing the acidity of the urine. It by no means renders the urine constantly alkaline, and its effect on the urine seems rapidly to pass away. Notwithstanding the large quantity of liquor potasso taken, the influence of food appears very evident; before each meal the acidity was highest; after each meal the alkalescence was greatest. The acidity of 1000 grains of urine was rarely more than sufficient to neutralize one grain of dry and pure carbonate of soda; and the alkalescence was more than equal to a grain and a half of carbonate of soda in 1000 grains of urine. The conclusion from these experiments is, that an ounce of liquor potassae taken in three days does not counteract or conceal the influence of the stomach on the reaction of the urine. III. (c.) The effect of tartaric acid on the acidity of the urine was then examined. Some splendid crystals of tartaric acid were given to me by Mr. MORSON. These were dried, reduced to a fine powder and heated in a water-bath until they ceased to lose weight; a weighed quantity was dissolved in distilled water. (25.) The first day for comparison no tartaric acid was taken. Breakfast at 8h 45mA.M, Dinner at oh ItOm P.M. Mixed diet. h m Spec. gr. Acidity per 1000 grs. of urine. Appearance.

Water passed at 8 10 = 1025*9 = + 14 62 Clear. The result of these experiments is easily seen in Plate XXII It follows that tartaric acid in large doses does produce a decided effect on the acidity of the urine; but it did not render the urine constantly acid during the three days that the experiment lasted. The first day on which the acid was taken, the urine was much more concentrated than on the two other days, and hence the effect of the smaller dose of acid appears more evident than the larger. The influence of the state of the stomach is very apparent. Before each ineal the acidity is greatest. After food, notwithstanding the tartaric acid, the acidity is diminished. The alkalescence of the urine was rarely so much as to equal one grain of car-bonate of soda in 1000 grains of urine; whilst the acidity of 1000 grains of urine for the most part required about two grains of carbonate of soda to make its reaction neutral. The conclusion from these experiments is, that 354 grains of dry and pure tartaric acid, taken in three days, increases the acidity of the urine; but in that time it does not render the effect of the stomach on the reaction of the urine less apparent than when no acid was taken. III. (d.) The effect of tartrate of potash on the acidity of the urine was then examined. Some well-crystallized tartrate of potash was dried, -reduced to a fine powvder and dissolved in distilled water. The solution was neutral to test-paper. 266 DR. BENCE JONES ON THE VARIATIONS (30.) The first day, for comparison, no tartrate of potash was taken. Breakfast at Sh 15m A.M. Dinner at 6h P.M. Mixed diet. Water passed at 6" 45m A.m. thrown away. h m Spec. gr.

The first day two drachms of dry and pure tartrate of potash were taken, dissolved in two ounces of distilled water, at 9h A.m. The same quantity was taken at 10h 25' A.M.; and one drachm of tartrate of potash was taken in one ounce of water at 2h 30m P.m. This last, on an empty stomach, caused slight nausea for twenty minutes. In all, then, on this day five drachms of tartrate of potash were taken in five ounces of distilled water.

It follows from these experiments, which are easily seen in Plate XXIII., that the influenlce of tartrate of potash is most decided. Inl five-and-.thirty minutes after tw~go 268 DR. BENCE JONES ON THE VARIATIONS drachms of tartrate of potash were taken, dissolved in four ounces of distilled water, the urine was found alkaline but in two hours the urine was again acid: the first effect on the urine had ceased to be very evident. That this was not caused by mere irritation of the stomach is seen by nitre and distilled water producing no similar effect. The influence of the tartrate of potash became again evident after the next neal, when the decrease in the acidity of the urine was much greater than when no tartrate of potash was taken. From the high specific gravity of the urine after the tartrate, it is probable that undecomposed tartrate of potash passes off in the urine, and from the height to which the acidity rises when the medicine is taken, it seems possible that the tartaric acid is not decomposed but separated from the base in transitu; but on this point further experiments are requisite. When much larger doses of tartrate of potash were taken, the rise and fall of the acidity of the urine before and after food were still distinctly evident. The conclusions from these experiments regarding the effect of medicines on the acidity of the urine are(b.) That liquor potassve taken in large doses does lessen the acidity of the urine. One ounce of liquor potassh taken in three days hindered the acidity of the urine from rising before food to the height it otherwise would have done, but it by no means made the urine constantly alkaline, nor did it hinder the variations produced by the state of the stomach from being very evident. (c.) That tartaric acid in large doses does increase the acidity of the urine. 354 grains of dry pure tartaric acid, dissolved in water, taken in three days, caused the acidity of the urine before food to rise considerably higher than it otherwise would have done; but this quantity of acid was not sufficient to hinder the urine passed a few hours after food from, being alkaline. This quantity of tartaric acid therefore in this time does not produce so much effect on the reaction of the urine as the stomach does. (d.) That tartrate of potash in large doses produces the most marked effect on the alkalescence of the urine. 120 grains of pure dry tartrate of potash dissolved in four ounces of distilled water made the urine alkaline in thirty-five minutes. In two hours the alkalescence had disappeared, but after the next meal the effect of the tartrate of potash was again apparent.
