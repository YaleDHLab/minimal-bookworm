(726) An Extract Of a Letter, written by D. B. to the Publisher, concerning the present Declination of the Magnetick Needle, and the Tydes, May 23. 1668. SIr, I here present you with a Scheme of the Magnetical Variations, as it was sent me by Capt. Samuel Sturmy, an experienced Seaman, and a Commander of a Merchant Ship for many years; who (as he assures me) took the Observations himself in the presence of Mr. Staynred, an antient Mathematician, & others, in Rownham-Meadowes by the water-side, in some such approach, I think, to Bristol, as Lime-house or the Fields adjoyning are to London. This (as the Table shews) was taken June 13. 1666. They observed again in the same day of the next year, viz. June 13. 1667; and then they found the Variation increas'd about 6. minutes Westerly. Observed June 13. 1668. Sun's Observ'd MagneSuns Variat. Altitude. tical true WesterAzimuth. Azimuth. ly. Gr. M. Gr. M. Gr. M. G.

June next following, with a Quadrant of 6 foot radius, accurately divided into minutes, and with a very good Needle about 8. inches long; and he doubts not, but the Observations shall be as exactly made, as can be done by any Men in any place of the World. He adds, that he has found in several places or Meridians, upon his own Observations, from 2. min. to 7. minuts some difference. In this Table he notes the greatest distance or difference to be 14. minutes; and so taking the mean for the true Variation, he concludes it then and there to be just 1. deg. 27. min. viz. June 13. 1666. The same person promiseth an exact accompt concerning Tydes (727) Tydes there, according to the directions formerly given in the Transactions. At present he assureth from many former Observations, that the biggest Spring-Tydes, and Annual Tydes there, are about the AEquinoxes, according as the Moon is neer the Full, or Change, before or after that time. Of this you may expect a more perfect account hereafter.
