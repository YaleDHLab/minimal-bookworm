: 425 2 XXII.Spplernentary Report on tbe best Metbod of proportioning l1pe Excise upon Spirituous Liquors. By Clzarles Blagden, 1ff. D. S. R. 3. Read Jtlne 283 179e. 1 HE Report to uthich this paper is intended as a Supplement, was drawn up) and published, when our experiments on the specific gravities of tlae spirituous llquors had been continued only to equal quarltities of alcohol and xvater by weight. It was foreseerl tllat a further set of experiments, on more dilute liquors, 8.would be wanted: but as these must necessarily take up a considerable tilne, the persolas concerned thought it best to sublnit those already made to the public; that if any errors or inaccuracies should be discovered they might be arroided, and if anyf persorl should suggest a better method it might be adopted, in the subsequent proceedings. Want of ice, and some other hinderatlces, prevented the experimentsXon what n1ay be called watery lllixtures from being entered upon earlier than the beg;inning of last winter. -Fresh spirit was dist;illed for the purpose by Mr. SCHMEISSER, who brought some of it totlse specific gravity of 8I7; but it had a smell somenvhat dif-ferent from that employed in the former experiments, and nore approaching; to the odour of ether. On inquiry we found, that, whereas Dr. DOLLFUSS had drawn the former spirit offvegetable alkali, Mr. SCHAXEISSER used GLAUSER S sal-t Dr. BLAGDEN'S SlpkMeStAry Reportcalcined by exposure to the air. In order to try whether . this circumstance made any diSeretlce in the quality ofthe new spirit, Mr. C;ILPIN mixed some of it wi-th an equal srtight o£ w-atel, and afterwards brought the tnixture to a11 the different temperatures from got to ooo°, operating in tlle satne manner as 11e had done with Dr DOLLFUSS'S spirit; when the specitic gras ities were found to come out the same Mr. SCHMEISSERJS alcohol therefore, was used without hesitaticon. As no censure had tret been passed on otar fortner experirnents, the salue general method was pursued fo-r the new series; wtith a small variatione however, -the resora of ^hich is now to be ex ^ plained. In the Report on the first experiluents I lntroduced tlle folIowing remark. s; It tnust be (3bserved, that Mr. GILPIN used the sanze mixture throllghout all the diflerent tem<; peratures, heating it up --froln go° to aoo°; hence some-" small error in its strength tnay havPe been occasioned, in the c; higher degrees, by more spIri;t evaporating than water; lout <; this, it is believed, must have beell trifling, and greater in(' conrenience would probably have resulted from interposing sc a fresh mixture}9 The coilsciousness tllat such a sour£e of error existed, made us desirous of ascertaining to what quantity it amoullted, by some previous experiluents, before the nes set should be begun. Tlleseshewed that it ntas somewhat greater than had been supposedy thougll not such as ever to cause a diSerenceof more than a fslngle unit in the third place of deci--mals, even in the temperature of zoo-°. The greatest diSerence found, sn tI;at degree of heat, was ,ooog+; and in a heat of 80°, the highest to which the tables fbr use were to -becarrieds it amounted only to ,ooo64-; being ln both cases on-Spirituous: Liqaors.A;27greatest svhen the luis-ture consisted of 85 p-arts of vvater, by weigElt, to Oo of alcohol. This di:Seretace llouZever, small as it was, aSordewd suffilcient reason--for repeating all the former experitnents, conjoinisly witla the llew set for dilute spirits, so as to make o:ze entire series, with the satne spiritn and execllftedtllroughout irl an utliforin rllanIler. To obviate the error froln evaporation in this series, and as(>ertain svha6t eacl-o mixture really lost of its strength during tlat operation, all the fluids were first weighed at 60°, bfore tlley weret cooledR downS to 30°, from :3o° to 100°, they were weighed atevery ^S de grees, as before, conseqtlelatly a second time at 60° ; and-lastly} after having been heated to woo°, they were again brought to 60°, and weighed at that point a third time. The difference between these Breights, at the beginning, middle, and end of the experiment, was applied, in due proportion, to correcl: the nunlbers of the respectiVe intervals between them; by vvllich means it is believed that the error arising from the gradual evaporatioll of the spirit, during the experiment, has beets -made to disappear. Mr. GILPIN having also observed, that tlle spirits adhering to the sides of the funnel which he employed to fill up the weighillg-bottle, grew weak by the evaporation, and so diluted the fresh spirit poured into tlae fiunrlel, determined to use a smaller instrument; of this kind7 namely, such an otle as would not hold more thall grains of spilit; in whiclh a less surface being left wet when the spirit ran outs the error froln this cause sroulel be proportionably diminished. Under all these precautions were the experimetlts made, of which the results -are given in the following tables. They are drawn up exactly like the tables in the former Report X 4^ Dr BLAGDENXS SuPl¢tentry A¢ort btt, a$ alcohol was talien for the fixed quantity irl the first halfs so water is taken fi the fixed qllantity irz the last halfs whichs therefore) cotssists of mistures containlng all lOQ grRitlS of waters with 9S grains go 8, and so orl successively9 ofb alt cohol, till the last column is pure water.

In drawing up the Reporty in order to avoid pro lixity,, the reasons forXchoosing sotne of the methods were not givenn where they -dld not seem likely to be a suject of controversy ; -but tEls pamphlet-A-ulakes it -necessary to -assigll the tnotives of our p-reference that tlie p0blic nay judge how fir we are justified. . .

This was done for the following reasons: * Because it wtas thought tnore likely to avoid blllriler-s, if the quantity of only one of the ingredients was cllangeable that the operator might not have his attention distracted with computing and sveighing out two different quantities for each -mixturee s. Because by this plogression the experimelats come closer together about the medium degreesof strength. where it was supposed most accursy woulcl be-warlted for practice. $* A-s it sntas thought-, fromitlle first, that the best method of adjusti7ng the duty svould be by the absolute qualatity of alcohol itl anXy mixture rather Xk An account of Experiments to determine thq Specific Gravity of Fluids ;by }.

These objectionS joined to the corlsideration tllat llo objt can be attaitled in tllis way, which was not accomplished, with at least equal accuraty, alld probably no greater trouble, by weighing the spirit and water separately, determined us not to attempt any experil:nellts with such an instrument. Thirdly, it isnosr to be explained why we undertook to deterlmine the eSect of heat and cold on the fluidsj by means of . .. the weighing-bottle. When, preparatory to our former experlmentss that part -of the subject came under consideration themethod of ascertairling the expansions and contractiorls by means of instrunaents like thermometers, was one of the first SK 2 DF. BLAG2EN'S Supplegentoery Report43sXthat presented itsel£ 0n this occasion, Mr. CAGFEND-ISH was so good as to melltiotl sotue experilnents made bv his fathern Lord CISARLES CkVENDISH, u7ith iastruments oll tllat constrtlction, for the srery purpose of determ-ining the exparlsion of fluids, and other experilalents, of the same nature, laarre appeared in prillt. The ap?lication of this methodf, how everX was thought liable to a most tmportant objection, from the great diiculty thereis of being sure that the spirits in the ball are exactly of the temperature indicated by the thermo Ineter placed by -th side of it. To enlarge upon this cir cumstance would be useless -as every person accustomed Dto experimerlts is ass7are that all possible precautions, joinedt toi the utrnost attention ill the observer, are scarcely sufEcient to ensure this essentialcorrespondence of temperature; which sea-son alone would 11ave induced us: to prefer the method; by weightP But there utats another argument o?hich still more fUrcibly determinec! us in fa-vour of the latter; namelyX that the eSect of mixture was found in that way, and therefore we were Sstlre it admitted of asgreat accuracy as was obtained in the otheor part of the experimellts. Greaternicety, if there had been a methotl which allowed of it, would have been . . superflucous ; and to incur the risk of less accuracy vvould laasre been ab-solutely unjllstifiable. By using the sallle luethod to deternlirle a11 the changes of specific gravity, those from heat as well as those from misture, an uniformity is >given to the who]e -series of experimentss and llo O-I1epart of the results is liable to more suspicion than allother. Till this titne, I believes the instrumVetlts with a b-all and tube, for tryirlg expansiolls, had all beell constructed in the tuatlner o:f real thermometersy to be filled by means of heat S an Spiri:tuozes Liqllors. +S3 Xwhich clrcumstance, and the trouble attending it was a furl;her objection to their use: but in tile patnphlet aboGrernen-tioned-are propmed tvo instruments of this nature, to be filled WItilOlltheat; one being providedwithtwoequaltubesthe other with a short tube closed by a stopper. Tllough botl tllese itlstrumettsX aald especially the latter seemecl liable tc} several causes of error, yet to retnove doubts, and brilag the method by weigh-t to a proper test, WIr. GILPIN was desired to m.ake sotne trials with them ; WIr. 1lAMSDEN) the autllor of the pamphlet, having been previously requested to go nthrcough the xvllole series oSexperitnerts on his osvrl platl, whicwh lle declined to clo. With no sluall difficulty Mr. GILPIN got tlle ixastru ments esecuted ; and al1 accotlnt of the txperiments to which 311e subjected them sllall be given, in his own srorcIs, at the end of tTiis Pveport. Frotn the pertl$al of that accoun:t9 it will be perceivecS, that the disagreement of the experitnents among themseIves, is tlearly equal to the quarltity by which any of theln diier from tlle expsansionsas obtairled by weiglat. ()n the svholeX horenter, tlley give the expansioll sonzewhat less, tlae cause of svlaich I do 1lot see; pssibly it lmay clepend ors the flvlid in the 1tal1 not being qu;te laeated and cooledto the degree shown by the accompanying tlaermometer; possibly tlae-re na-ay be a diSe?lsellce in the ex-pansion of the glass with rvllicln the instruments srrere made9 and that of the weighingt 1030ttle) fUr these numbers are in both cases the excess of the expansion of the fluicl over gla; or it may turtl on sonie other circumstance, which has eluded our attetltion. Whatever rnay have occasioned the deficiency, I think the experinlents wsill satisfy any olae, that most deperdence is to be pIaced o11 tlle weiglats; and at all everlts the difference is not such Dr. BLAGDEN'S Supplementary Reportas to aSect-*the third place of decim-als, or corlsequetltly the tables intendedtfor practice .: ProbabW no o-ne will be surprised that we did not think it necessary t;o make trial of the weighing-lsottle proposed by Mr. RAMSDEN. Not to mention other irlconarelliences attend-+ ing this instrvisnelltt it seems evident that a piece of flat glass} with a thermometer projecting fE:oul it, laid down on tlle luouth --of a bottle, cannot be depended upon to push oFthe superfluous Iiquor equally every time ; and that the proper wiping of the bottle, vv hen so covered, will be attetlded with diHiculties of vario:us kinds.: It is true tha-t -the experiments by weigIlt took up much tim:e} and denianded g3reat patience. But I believe that similar experiments, by the methods recommended in the pam?hlet, if executed with the same degree of accuracy would be found fino-t much less tedious. However this nlay be, it is a -consideration of llo consequence, provided theresults at length obtainedbe right. Now of these there is no direct impeachment, thougll sQtne doubts are thrown UpOIl them, on four accounts ; eYaporatio n; condensatiotl of moisture on the weighing-bottle; difficulty of shaklng the fluid in it; alid ulicertainty in determining tlae heat. With regard to evaporationX its effiectX we hope, has been ascertainedv and allow-ed for, in these new experimentsv All error frotncondensation of moisture was obviated by careful wiping. The fluid in the weiglling-bottle as agitated, and mixed together bymeans of the thermometer immersed in it @ besides hich a considerable degree of rnotion could be given .to it, even when the ball was very nearly fuII, Xby sllaking the bottle in various directions Mr. GILPIN}S known accuracy, and tlle care he bestowed or on S;piritaxolls Liquort4SS these experimet<ts, must gain hllzz credit for har7ing duly svatcTted the therrnotneter,so as to seize tile moment when it gave the just telnperature of the mass.

Yet it any of the methods he proposed had been really prefErable, the whole series shoulel have beenv repeated on that new plarl, and particularly with regard-<to -the eSect of heat, if the insttumelzts for that purpose lead beell found to answer the -character given of thetn. But as this mTas not the caseS we have thought it right to adhere to an obvious and direct lYlethod, in +hich however laborious, there can be no fallacys and the unifortnity of svllich ensures an equal degree of acCUraCY tO everY Part Of the OPeratiOn. SINCE the publication of our first tables, several hydrometers llave been contrived, Witll the view of applyillg: them to prac tice. Those of copper vvere reJected on accourlt of the errors which small alld almost imperceptible bruises in thern lnighe Qccasion; and for the same reasoll no othwer metal was tried;. Mr. GILPIN has constructed two areometers of glass; one wit}< the stem so divided, that an easy table may be formed for theX correction necessary according to the diSerent weights with which it is used; the otller with a separate scale fixed to each of those eightbs, made to slip into the tubular stem of the illstrument; a contrivance that obviates the necessity of a table. Adr. RAMSDEN also hm invellted a balance 11ydro lueter utitll several varieties of constructions oneof which isdetailed in his patnphlet. All the above-mentioned instru ments appear to have fully as much accuracy as can be :436:Dr. BLAGDEN'S S-upplementary Report-required; of their preferenceila otber respects, tlle practical offlcers who are to use thetn will probably be found the best Judges. That which Ct1 be managed witll the greatest fsi :-lity and qu-ickness9 uthich affords the least opportunity of naking blunclers, wllich is least liable to be out of order, alld shews most immediately if it be so, will unquestionably prove the rnost satisfactory in practice Hydrometer s having a thermzometer inclosed xvithin tlem must be cotldemned, as rlot ascer -ta-ining tlle tenaperature vvtith the requisite ptecision. An attempt to supersede the use of the thermometer by e:tnployillg for the hydrometer, a substaruce whichv " has the same ';: degree of expansioll as the mean of the compoutlds,'' is very inconsi$tent with the lvin-d of accuracy sought by these expe riments. As an allowance is made9 in our table of specificgravities, for the expansion and contraction of the glass weighing-bottie, this must be tal<en into the account with every areometer, when ever xnuch exactness is desired. I azn still of opinion, that the best Vay of laying tlle duty wollld be dlrectly on the qllatltity of alcohol corltained in any composition ; and tlaough -this tnigllt require too great a change in the-present system of laws, yet as the same principle tnay be applied in estimating the strength, and taking stock, I will just mention in hat manner thevcoluputation can be most readily made-. From the numbers in this Supplenentary Report a table lMtlSt be constructeKd, on the top of which shall stand every degree of heat from +O or So, to 80j and at the side every specific gravityfrom ,82qS to ,ooo, if it be thought necessary, or as much less as will answer thepurpose. The places of this table are to be filled up, by colnputings from on SSirituous Liqaors.7the original talules, the quantity by measure of alcohol-and water corresponding -to each specific grasrity and degree of heat ; and then dividirlg the quantity of alcohol by the whole quantity of the lmixture-; thus a decimal lllultiplier will be obtained, whlch rnust be put in the compartment of the table formed by the intersectiorl of the columlls of that particular heat and specific gravity Wllen vlae table is colnpleted il this manner we hafire only to naultiply the colltents of any cask, as found on gauging it, by the decimal number given irs the table for the heat and specific gra^rity of the liquors and the product will be the qvlantity of ptlre alcollol it contains. Hence it must be evident, that no objection can lie to thls method on account of difficulty; if, hosgever, it be thought mote eligible, for difEerent reasons, to adopt the proportiotl of alcohol per cent..., the relation of strength to the point of proof; or any other methoul the nulnbers in tlliS Report nvill equally apply to a11, with the prcuper variation in the table to be elnpIoyed. As to the calculation llecessary-for corlstrllctillg -the table of decirnal -multipliers, what has been already said with respect to the reduction of the harmonic numbers applic-s also to it. T.he labour of the whole will not be very great, and it is once for a11. The process is rzot an approxinzation, but a plairl arithmetical conputations which rzzay be carried on true to as m-alXy decimal places as thve experiments will allosrc For this pur4 pose, indeed, it is llecessary to have tlle weight of a krlown measure of water. Mr. RAMSDEN'S method of obtailaing this, by mean$ of a cylinder, i-s far preferable to that of hollow cubes, paXicularly if the ends of the cylinder can be made as true as the body of it.

S \\ C: BLAGDE0N. Sppendix to the foregoing Report. h a Letter from Mre George Gilpina CIks A SP to Charles Blagden; M. Va Sc Re S SIR, HAV ING cotupleted two instruments fbr trying the expatisivIl of fluids, a-ccording to the lmLethod described by Mr. RAMSDEN rihth a stopper going into a tube on the side of the ball, I now present yotl wsth an account of the experiments which t have nzade with them, that y;ou may judge l:ow far such irustrumentsl are deserving of notice. The scale of the longesta admits of 26 of an inch for each clegree of the thertBLometer, and that of tlle shortest ,t7 of ala inch for each degree. TIley rere charged with pure spirit : some of the same that was 1nade use of in our experiments by weight, specific gravity ,82q14: and having hung them up by tlle side of each other to a piece of wood, provided for the purpose, with the salne sensible tllermometer hallgirlg between them that was used in our experiments by weight, I ilnmersed them in a large quantity of water brought tc) tlle temperature of 60t, the one quiteX the other nearly, to the height of the fluid ill the stem. In this water they were suffiered to continue until they had arrived at th-at temperature, when it ssras observed that the spirit in the tube o-f the long instrunent stood at , or -the commencezaellt of the scale,and the spirit in the tube of tlle short instrument stood at I otoSoo -above o which I shall 3L 2 44o Jppendix fo Dr BLAGDEN S Reptin future for shortrless call ,G and whicll it s*s evidetlt must be applied vith tRe sign f or to the qualltity of expan sion or contrtzetion resad offfrol-n above or 13e]our o, as tlae case may require. Tlley sere then cooled down to so° of teXperature, when tlle spirit in the long instrutnent was found to stand 16S, and tllat in the short itlstrument <6$,^ below o. tRhey were again t3rotlght to the tenz-perature of 6OO, when the slirit in the long instrument was found to stand o,Ss belowo at1ditl the silort il-lstrumeIlt ns above o as beforeO They sverethet1 heated to 100°, when the spirit sn the long itlstrument stood 'At 231 and ill the short instrument at 2S3, above o I brougllt theIn agaln to the temperature of 60°, urhen tlae spirit in tlle lolxg instrutae2lt wras found to statld S below o, but in the short irlstrtl:tnent ,, above o as before. It appears from these experirnents, that the -contraction of the spirit, by the longillstrument, for 30 degrees, that is, in cooling dos^rn frotn 60° to SQ°, iS 16S; but in heating it up ag-aill to 60°, it was found laot to stand at otas before, hut o, below ; therefore the expansioIl will be oaly 164,,g, the mean is 164,S. The expansion, on heating up from 60° to loo°, will be 2g+0,=231,5; hut oll cooling down from woo° to 60t agai, the spirit was found to sixlk 3 below o, therefore it will be gs+3 = gs4 ; the mean 232,7t5, and the total expansion, from so° to zoo°_ 397,,; differing from ours, in defect, by 0,QS of a divissn.

Havi1lg brought the1n to the tempEerature of 60°, I found tlle spirit i}1 the log instrument to stand $ above o, and in the short instrulnellt S below o. They were the11 cooled down to goQ of temwratlJre; hell the spirit in the long instrument was found to sink to 161,, and intthe short instrum@nt to 67,. They were afterwards brought back again to 60° of temperature > when tile spirit in the long instru;ment stood g ahove Q, as befbre, but ill the short instrut ment SSS belosv o. I then heated themh 1lp to 1ooS, and it stood ifin the 1ong instrument at 234 and in the short instruanent at 2X6, above Q. They were again brought to the teruperature of 60°; when it was foutld tov stand in the long gnstrument at o, and in the short ilutrumerit at s below o. From the above exp!eriments it appears, that the contracwtion btr elong irlstrunllent,. ill cooling down fFom 60° to zo°, is 161,5+3 = 164445, atld the expansion in heatitlg up again to 6O°, the same. Ill heating up from 60° to loo9, 2t$+-3 = 291 ;. but the contractioll in cooling dot n agaln from loo° to 60°? 234; the mean is 23s,S and the total exparlsion Eom sQ° to 100°=397, difiring from the experiments by weight oS58 of a-division in deict: but if no mean be talien, the deficietlv A9pendix to Dr BLAGDENSS Report442wilI appear greater. The difference between heating up frotn 60t to tooo, and cooling down agaitl from zoo° to 60°, is g divisions, still tnore considerable in this thall irl the last experiment. The contraction by tlle sllort instrument frolxl 60V to go° is o67,-S z62,, and the expalasion from go° to 60Q again 167,, , = 162 ; the mean is 162,25* 0I1 lleating up from Co° to loo°, 226+5,5-23l,5; bUt tlle contraction, in -cooling dowll again from loo° to 60° ras 226+8 234; the naean is 232n75, and the total expansion from go° to too° 39S; diffiering from the experiments by weight 2n55 divisions, in defect. The diffierence between heatillg up from 60° to 1Q0° and coolillg down (agairl from 1o0° to 60°, iS 2,S divisions. Afier the above experiments had been made, the spirit was let out, and, orl a subsequent day, the two instruluents were charged again with some of the same spirit, previous to the following experiments. After bringing tlae spirit to the temperature of 600, I found it to stand in the lollg illstrunlent 6 above o, and in the short instrument 2 below o. I cooled the spirit down to So°, whetl it stood in the long instrument tS8,,t, and itl the short instrulnent z66, below o. I brought it again to the temperature of 60°, and it returned to the same }?oint it set off from, itl both instrutnents. The spirit wras then heated to ioo°; when it rose in the long instrument to 235, and in the short instrument to sSo, above o. I cooled it again to the temperature of 60° when it was found to stand in the long instrument 1 below o., alld in the short instrument S below o. It appears, from the above experiments, that the contraction by the long instrument irl cooling down from 60° to 30° is 1$8, on Spirituous LiquorsO 443 +6-164n5 and the expansion in heating uis from go° to 60° the salne.

In this experiment it seetns pro bable eitller that svlne of the spirit leaked out at the stoppery or that the stopper shifted its place a little, so as to enlarge tEle capacity of the ball.

The following experi-ments were rnade with a mixture of equal parts of spirit axld water by veight; the spirit being of the strength aIready rn-erltioned-. Having;charged the instruments vvrith the mixture3 and brought it tQ the temperature of 6o°, it was found to stand in bo-tll of them at 1 above o. The mixture was then cc)oled donvn to qgo° when it stood at 125 below o in the long illstrumellt, arld S4,^ in the short instrulnent.

The difference between the mean of the two heatings up from 60 to lGO° and tlle two coolings down from oo° to Go° again, is 2,7s divisions. The mixture made use of in the above experiment was now emptied out, and tlae instrulnents were charged with mole of the sarne, preparatory to the following experiments. The mixture being brought to the tsemperatute of 60°, was found to stand in each of the instruments at sS above o.

The difference by the short itlstrument ist -t,83 divisione Although the results found froln the preceding experim-t$> vome nearer those of tlae-e*periments by weight than might have been expected, considerirlg the many objections that instrumellts of this kind must naturally present, and the great differences which were actually foulld atnong theruselves orl repeating the experiments, espsi-ally in the expansion of pure spirit where the diffierence has been ec uivalent to ,68 grains an weight, UpOll the quantity used in: our experiments with the weighing-bottle; yet I thirlk, aRer a careful perusal oxf the foregoing facts, I shall not be thought too precipitate when I say, that these instrumerlts rueither d:o nor can possessthat accuracy which we have been led to expectfrom the-m. ; We harre seenX in the foregoing expertments, that there ht sometimes been apparently a loss of some part of the fluid, after all alteration of the ;temperature; at other times there appeared to he no loss at all; and sometimes there-appeared to be even more spirit irz the instruwment than there was ai; $M X ;448Apperldix to Dr. BLAGDEN s Reporr-first. These contradictory facts ntay I apprehend -be ac counted for in the followitlg mannerw The mecharlical operation of grinding a stopper th-at will fit so delicate a tubes as is here rsecessary, perfectly tights must be acknowledged: to 1;)e difficult ; and should it happen to be done accurately, so that none of the<:fluid is lost in one degree of temperature it is very doubtful whether, on exposing this instrument to a differe}t temperature, the expansion would be the same in both the tube and stopper. It appears most probable} from these experiluents, that they actually did }zot expand alike, as perhaps no two:pieces of glass ever do; and the effiect to be expected .lNrom a less expansion of the stopper than of the tube is, eitller that some of the fluid would leak out, or that the capacity of e bal} vvtould be enlargede But the chief reason svlly there may-sometimes seem to be a loss at other times no loss at -S11, I apprehend to be, that m:ore of the fluid will adhere to the llpper part of the tuben on filling it, at one time than at another. In the use of this itlstrument also, a small error n}ay arise from the stopper not beitlg always put in exactly alike; in which case the capacity of the instrument would be altered a and, of course the divisions on its stem would rlot give the expansion of the fluid accurately. Care was always taken sn these experiments to put the stopper in z llearly alike as possible>; but it might not perhaps always be done exac.tly so. It is also obvious, that experilnents with this instrument will -he: affiected by another source of error i£ made in tlle mallner =, .. .. which is recommended, namely) by heating the fluid up from 60t -to ooo°, and coollg it down again to sQ° :for it lMUSt be -evident that the whole length of the tube will then be left nxget Sby t-he fluid, in sinking from 100° to 30°a and conseon Spiritaous Liquors. : 4959+' -quently theexpansionvill be:madeto appeartoogreat. The eSect of tllis circumst-ance will be rery considerable ; but in the -use of this instrulment we have no certain lneans of ascertainw -ing with accuracy the quantity of error occasioned by it, because that quantity falls in with otlaer errors Of this I shall speak more hereafter, itl tny remarks on another instrulnent wllich I constructed, without a stopper, atld hich was also recomlnended by the same getltlernan. THE former experimetlts were a11 made with that kind of itastrumellt which has a tube rising from the side of:the ball, with a ground-glass stopper inserted in-to it; an instruDrtient we; have seen by no mearls to be considered as sufficiently accu;rate for ascertaining the expansion of fluids ; I therefore corstructed anotherS similarto the other of the two recommetirSded by Mr RAMS5DEN, which llas tsuo tubes rising fron. the ball one on each side IIaving charged this instrutnerlt with some of thesamespirit which was made use of in the -former experiments, alld brought it to the temperature of 60o, tlle spirit in the tsvo tubes was found:: to stand at 4. above o.. It was then cooled dowlli to 30°? when the spirit ln th-e two Xtubes was found to stand at 161 below Q, the irlstrument being always so held a.s to bring it to the same point in both tubes I then heated ift up to ooot, alld it stood in the tmro tubes at 2g6 above o. I cooled it again to go°, wher:l it wasfound to stawd in the twa tubes at r 62 below o. It was agairl heated uep to soo°, and iot stood in the two tubes at 2 g6 above o. I then brought it again tQ the temperature of 60t, and found 0 it to stand irl the two -tubes at no more than 3 above Q. Sppendlx to Dr BLAGDENS Report--43OIt appears from the above experIments, that the contraction of the spirit from 60° to So° is 161 + 4 .--164y, and the expan sion in heating up again to 60°, the same.

It tnust also be -obvious that 397, which was found for the total expansion in heating up from :30° to 1ooo, must likew-ise be too great by nearly the same quantity, it harring beerlcooled down from 60° to :3o° previous to its -being heated up to :loo°, as this would tend to make it sink so much lower than it woulcI hav done in the first irsstance had that not been the case. After the above experimellts, the spirit was poured out, and prev-io-us to the repeti-ticon ofthe foregoing experiments on a fu ture day, it was charged with more of the -same spirit which --was used in the former experiments, and the instrument was hung up as beforew on Spirituous Liquors. ZL ;Havixlg brought it to the temperature of 60t, the spirit in the twto ttlbes was found to stand at 4i above o. I cooled it dourn to -3Q°y NYhen it stood in the two tubes at s60a$ below o I brought it again to tlle temperature of 60°, and it vvas founcl to stand in the two tubes at 4 aborre o as before. It was then heated up to zoo°, and was found to stand in the tWQ tubes at g6 above or I cooled it down again to SOQ and found it to stand in the two tubes at 162 below o. It was then brought ag;ain to the temperature of 60° and was found to stand in the two tubes at no tno:re than 25 above o. From the preceding experiments it appearsv that the conv traction in cooling down fFom 60° to SoQ, is 160>, + 4 = 164,ff> atld irl heating up; from gOa to 60° again, the expansion was the satne. Ill heating up from 60° to zoo9, the expansion was s36-4-= 232-, therefore the total expansion in heating up from so° to oo° will be 396,$; but in cooling down again from lQOQ to So°, we shall have for the total expansion 236 + 162 398. The former quantity of 3963s differs oS in defectn and th;e latter ov45 of a division in excessa from the experiments by weight: but it is obxriou.s from this, as well as firom the preceding experimenta that the metl:lod of heating-up from So° to oo° can only give the true expansion as has already beerl observed for when the spirit is cooled dow7n from Cot to ,go° the expansion will be made greater than it ought to be; as it was found on setting oK, that the spirit in the tWQ tubes at dot wof temperature stood at 4 above o S and after havillg -been cooled down to ,o°) and heated up again to 60° it was found to stand the same: but after having been heated up to lso° and cooled down agairl to O° the contraction Appendix to Dr. BLAGDEN>S Report52from Co° to got was fourld greater ly ,, than before; and oll -heating up to 60° again, it was found to stand only 2,J, instead of 4, above o It is therefore very reasonable to conclude, that a quantity equal to ,5 had adhered to the upper part of-the tutesf and no wellgrounded objection can be tnade tto this, when we collsider that 1 division is only equal to ,XS of:a grain of spirit, in this instrument.

It was afterwards brought to the te1nperature: of 6O° and suffered to remain in tlaat temperature for three hours, when it was found to stand at 6 above Q.

RAMSDEN respecting the accuracy of thetwo instrumentswith which the foregoing experiments have been made, there was great reason to expect that different results would have been found. It appears tllat no dependance otlght to be PIAGed on experitmellts made on Spirituous Liquors. 455 with that kind of instrument which has a tube rising from the side of the ball, to be closed with a stopper. More accuracy may undoubtedly be expected from experiments made with the other kind of instrument which has two tubes, because one of the inconveniences attending the former is removed in it: but we have seen that even experiments made with this instrument do not bear the same marks of accuracy as the experiments by weight; nor can this be much wondered at, if it be considered that the trifling error of,027 of an inch, in constructing the instrument, will produce an error of one division, which is equal to 0,24 of a grain on the quantity contained in our weighing-bottle; and how difficult and uncertain it is in such an instrument to ascertain the exact temperature, by placing a thermometer only by the side of it. It is not uncommon to see the fluid in the expansion instrument, and the mercury in the thermometer, move contrary ways: and I have more than once observed an alteration in the thermometer, of more than half a degree, when no alteration whatever has been produced in the fluid in the expansion instrument. Indeed, on the least reflection it must be obvious to every one, that the changes of temperature of the fluid in a ball of 11/4 inch diameter, cannot be expected to be so quick as in one of 0,22 of an inch. It is also of the utmost consequence in making experiments with this instrument, though it will render it extremely tiresome to the experimenter, that it be in continual motion; for should that precaution not be observed, very considerable errors indeed will take place.
