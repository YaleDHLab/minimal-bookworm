[ 225 ] VIII. On a General Method in Analysis. By GEORGE BOOLE, Esq. Communicated by S. HUNTER CHRISTIE, Esq., Sec. R.S. S&c. Received January 12th,-Read January 18th. MUCH attention has of late been paid to a method in analysis known as the calculus of operations, or as the method of the separation of symbols. Mr. GREGORY, in his Examples of the Differential and Integral Calculus, and in various papers published in the Cambridge Mathematical Journal, vols. i. and ii., has both clearly stated the principles on which the method is founded, and shown its utility by many ingenious aud valuable applications. The names of M. SERVOIS (Annales des Math6matiques, vol. v. p. 93), Mr. R. MURPHY (Philosophical Transactions for 1837), Professor De MORGAN, &c., should also be noticed in connection with the history of this branch of analysis. As I shall assume for granted the principles of the method, and shall have occasion to refer to various theorems established by their aid, it may be proper to make some general remarks on the subject by way of introduction. Mr. GREGORY lays down the fundamental principle of the method in these words: s" There are a number of theorems in ordinary algebra, which, though apparently proved to be true only for symbols representing numbers, admit of a much more extended application. Such theorems depend only on the laws of combination to which the symbols are subject, and are therefore true for all symbols, whatever their nature may be, which are subject to the same laws of combination." The laws of combination which have hitherto been recognised are the following, X and g being symbols of operation, u and v subjects. 1. The commutative law, whose expression is ?ru=gxru. 2. The distributive law z (u v) =;ru+ rv. 3. The index law, 5rm~rnUrm+nU. Perhaps it might be worth while to consider whether the third law does not rather express a necessity of notation, arising from the use of general indices, than any property of the symbol z. The above laws are obviously satisfied when r and g are symbols of quantity. d They are also satisfied when z and ? represent such symbols as . A. &c., in combination with each other, or with constant quantities. Thus, 2Gs;2 226 MR. BOOLE ON A GENERAL METHOD IN ANALYSIS. d(au) =dud (+)du Add d These properties of the symbol ', taken in connection with the, principle above enunciated, lead to the most important, results that have been yet established by the calculus of operations. We have an early example of their application in the symibolical form of TAYLOR Its theorem, viz. A result to which we shall often refer is the following. If we have a linear equation with constant coefficients of the form irnu+A17rn-1'u+A2 A-2u... +Anu=X, wherein ir operates solely on u, and is therefore commutative with respect to Al, A2, &c., then u={n+A14-14+A2,--2.. +Anl-'X =N,(,r a)-X+N,(-r-)-'X+ a.) N1, N2.. al, a2.. having the same values as in the resolution of the rational fraction F +Ag|-1. +A. into a similar series of terms*. It is obvious that the above method is of necessity limited in its application. It is only in linear equations with constant coefficients that the operative symbols combine in subjection to the law we have supposed. Accordingly it has been remarked, that the calculus of operations has tended rather to simplify the processes of analysis than to extend its power. The object of this paper is to develope a method in analysis, which, while it operates with symbols apart from their subjects, and may thus be considered as a branch of the calculus of operations, is nevertheless free from the restrictions to which we have alluded. The linear equation with variable coefficients, whether in differentials or in finite differences, will be treated under the form fo(X)u+ AOr)Su +f2 (X)2u + &c.= U, U being a function of the independent variable x, and X and a operative symbols, which combine in subjection to the law f(A)r = f(7r+m)u, and which, when the subject function u is unity, further satisfy the relation f(A)rmf(m)rg It might be expected, a, priori, that a theory of linear equations founded on such a* Cambridge Mathematical Journal, vol. ii. p. 114, vol. iii, p. 239. MR. BOOLE ON A GENERAL METHOD IN ANALYSIS. 227 basis, would be of peculiar character. Its actual advantages I conceive to be the following:1 The necessary reductions, transformations and developments are effected, forthe most part, by theorems, the expression of which is independent of the forms of f0 (7r), 5f(4) &c. 2. We are thus able to establish a perfectly general method for the solution of linear differential equations total and partial in series, and for the calculus of generating functions. 3. The form of the analysis affords facilities, which are believed to be peculiar to itself, for the finite integration of linear equations, and for the classification of integrable forms. The received theory of the solution of linear differential equations in series is given by EULER*. It consists in assuming u=Earxm, and determining by substitution the relation connecting the successive values of a,,,, or as it is called, the scale of the equation. This method fails when, in seeking the first index of a development, we arrive at equal or imaginary values. I am not aware that any mathematician has shown how this failure is to be remedied. Now the method developed in this paper has no such cases of exception. The theory of series and of generating functions has been successively discussed by EULER and LAPLACE. A full account of their researches is given in LACROIX'S larger treatise on the Calculus, torn. iii., in the chapters Thdorie des Suites and tehdorie des Fonctions Gdndratrices. I class these investigations together, because, although their objects are distinct, their mathematical theories are virtually the same. EULER proposes to determine the generating function of a series, Numtr, when the coefficients are formed according to such a law as the following: (am+ b)(am + bl)..., c (cm + e)(celm + el) ... m-lP He shows that by successive differentiations and integrations, the factors am +b, cm+e... may be eliminated, and the problem finally reduced to the solution of a differential equation. LAPLACEt, considering the unknown quantity u, in an equation of differences as the general coefficient of the expansion of a function u, proposes to determine u, and then by expansion to obtain us. It is not necessary for us to consider here whether the theory of generating functions is of any importance to the solution of equations of differences. The discovery of the generating function of a series is in itself a problem both interesting and important. Those who have paid attention to the subject will, I think, admit that the theories by which EULER and LAPLACE have endeavoured to accomplish this object, labour under two defects, one arising from the tedious character of the process by which the differential equation is formed, the other from the difficulty of its integration. This does by no means derogate from the genius or the claims of those wonderful men;* Calc. Integ. vol. ii. Ts. 228 MR. BOOLE ON A GENERAL METHOD IN ANALYSIS. for the value of every discovery is in some measure relative, and is to be measured by the state of contemporary science as well as by its abstract merit. The advantages which the method of this paper is believed to possess as respects the theory of series, are the following: 1. The law of the series being known, or the equation of differences given, the differential equation is known by inspection. The rule is absolutely general, whatever may be the forms of the coefficients. 2. The form under which the differential equation is presented offers great facilities for its integration. Those facilities are chiefly owing to the circumstance, that the form of the equation permits us, as before remarked, to effect the requisite transformations by general theorems. That this form has a peculiar fitness for the processes of integration, is further shown by the circumstance, that the method of resolution which in the common theory leads to the solution of differential equations with constant coefficients, conducts us here to the solution of a large class of equations with variable coefficients. The arrangement of the subjects treated in this paper will lead us to consider,1st, linear differential equations; 2nd, the theory of series; 3rd, the theory of generating functions; 4th, the theory of equations of finite differences.

The first term fo(0Q) is equal to f('r): this may be proved lay induction from the particular cases of (z+g)2, (5X+g)3, &c., but perhaps more rigidly thus. Let k be a symbol such that kf(r)=f0Q(). Then the first term of the expansion of (Z+)f(Z+g) is kzf(ar); but by (3.) this term is xfo(5r)-Sk(t), therefore k zf(r) = rkf(r); wherefore z and k are commutative. It is hence evident that k can only operate as a constant multiplier, the value of which is independent of the formr of f(r).

With a view to the maintenance of an unbroken analogy, it has, however, been thought better to deduce them from the properties of the more general system in 7r and o, than to assume them as already proved.

In like manner may every term in the first member of the original equation be reduced; also the second member, which is a function of x, will become a function of eA; the aggregate of these results will produce an equation of the form (VIII.). More generally, let it be supposed that we have a system of linear differential equations, total or partial, the dependent variables being ujvj.. the independent variables xIx2.. whereof the second members of the equations are functions; if we assume x1=01 x2=6.2. the transformed equations may be so written as to satisfy the following conditions. 1 st.

To any aggregate of terms of the form 0(D1, D2.)jr2+r2 .u the same analysis is applicable, whence our fundamental theorem, viz. If v= 2um) then p(D1, 2 = . t . . } (X.) In applying this theorem to an expression consisting of many terms, the sign E must be affixed to the aggregate in the second member, as in (IX.), and not to each term separately. The relation which the first member of (IX.) bears to the lineal differential equation, is the same -as is borne by the coefficient of amO in the second member to the linear equation of finite differences. This analogy extends to the fundamental theorem, which may be defined as a general relation connecting any lineal differential equation, or system of-linear differential equations, with a corresponding equation or system of equations in finite differences. 2u2 4234 MR.

Let p be the lowest value of m, then since up-1, u -2, &C. vanish, we have from (7.) fo(p) 0, whence the values of p are determined. If p have n real values, there will be n ascending developments of the form u=u =VS+UV?16(P+l)d+u, +2g(P+2)0.., ad infnitum, up in each development being arbitrary, and the succeeding coefficients formed according to the law (7.). This method fails when p has equal or imaginary values, but the following rule is of universal application.

In the present instance, as P does not involve any arbitrary constants, and as the direct operation (D)i cannot introduce any, it is evident that L, M, N are simply numerical coefficients. The above expression for (D)iP applying to every term of the second menmber of (10'.), it is obvious thatf,(D)s"AP will be a linear function of P, Q, R.., whose coefficients are of the general type pn(D)rn#A, pn(D) denoting a rational and integral conmbination of (D). In like manner,f,(D)enBQ will be a linear function of P, Q, R, the coefficients whereof will assume the form 4',(D)sef?B.

In order to satisfy ( 1.) independently of the particular values of P, Q, R, let us assume A-0= Bt=0, C'=o.. . . (12.) Each of these equations being of the general form above given, we shall have by the fundamental theorem, A=-:(amgm@, B1=(bmm), C =(Cmsmo), &c. the successive values of am, b1 being connected by a system of relations of the general form, To find the lowest value or values of m in am, b1, &c., we must assume an-I, b1m-1 &c. to vanish, whence the last equation gives pO(m)am +4.o(m)bm*.._0. 236 MR.

Objections are commonly urged against the solutions of linear differential equations in series, on the ground that the condition of convergency is fulfilled only within narrow limits of the independent variable.

The symbolical form of the equation just considered is a(D-2)2+i2 D(D -1) 2uO(2) to which we shall have occasion to refer. In the employment of the general symbolical form of the linear differential equation, two principal cases will be considered; the first comprising such equations as are reducible to a system of an inferior order, by a method of resolution similar to that which is employed in the solution of linear differential equations with constant coefficients; the second including those whose solution depends on a transformation affecting the dependent variable u. A more general method of resolution will be explained in the sequel.

From inspection of the above it is evident that if @(D) is in the form of a rational fraction, and it is proposed to diminish (so to speak) D in any factor of the numerator, or to augment D in a factor of the denominator, by a, multiple of r, the process by which u will be finally deduced from v will depend upon differentiation ; but if it is proposed to augment D in a factor of the numerator, or to diminish D in a factor of the denominator, the process will involve integration. The former is obviously the preferable condition. The general proposition (XIV.) amounts in reality to this, that the equation u+,;(D) Sru=U .(29.) may be resolved into the system of equations, ~(D) __p D M-Pr~j(D)V, 4(D).(30.) v+4 (D) r'v.V,. (31.) whence V, v, u are to be successively determined. Of these equations we shall call the two first the auxiliary ones, and (31.) the transformed one. This premised, the following are the canons which regulate the determination of the constants. 1. If no factor of p(D) disappears in +(D), no arbitrary constants are to be introduced into the solutions of the auxiliary equations; those derived from the transformed equation being necessary and sufficient. 2. Disappearing factors are in general of the formi D +a, a-b being a multiple of r. a-b D~b Every such factor will give a system of constants in the solution of one of the r auxiliary equations; if in that of the equation determining V, those constants will be arbitrary, but one only will need to be retained; if however in that of the equation determining u, one only will be arbitrary, and the rest will be therewith connected by the relation ur+p(m)unI.-=0, derived from the primitive equation. The reason why the constants connected with the disappearing factor are arbitrary in V alone, is, that V enters into no other equation than the one in whose solution, those constants are found. If however the entire series of constants in V are retained, they will be reduced to one by the subsequent differentiations in passing to the value of u. Ex. 1.

If for nil we choose the least of the quantities m1 n2 .. m, and for n1 the greatest of the quantities n1 n2 .. n, the final derivation of u from v will be effected by differentiation. The only integrable forms of the equation u+p(D)sr~u-U, which are not comnprised in the above generalisation, are those which finally depend on a transformation affecting the independent variable.

We have, in Propositions 2 and 3 of the last section, fuilly considered the theory of the differential equation u+p(D)s1ru=U, and have exhibited in Prop. 1 a method of resolution by which a more extensive class of equations may be reduced to the preceding form. In what follows I purpose to exemplify a more general method of resolution, founded on the expansion off(tr+g) in (I.). This method is deserving of particular attention for two reasons; first, because, in connexion with Propositions 2 and 3 already referred to, it enables us to integrate almost every class of linear differential equations that admits of integration in finite terms; and, secondly, because a strictly analogous method is applicable to equations of finite differences. I shall suppose the differential equation to be placed under the form fo (D)u +f(D)?(D)s'u +A(D)p(D)p(D1J)S2 . =U where fo(D), fi(D), &c. are any rational and entire functions of D, and P(D) an} function whatever of that symnbol. Let D--np(D)O=r and p(D)'=g, then by reasoning precisely similar to that of A, Prop. 3, it is seen that X and o combine according to the law, Now p(D)se=o, p(D)p(D1)e24=e, and so on. Wherefore the proposed equation will assume the form f0(D)zu+f1(D)?u +f2(D)?2u+ &c. =U.. (52.) But D=_r+ng, wherefore, expanding the coefficients of the above equation by (I.), we have fo(D) =fo(Qr) +nA'fo(IXO+)g + -f(r)e+ &C. And similarly for the rest, the interpretation of A being 2L2 258 MR. BOOIXE ON A GENERAL METH7OD IN ANALYSIS.

Several distinct cases may here occur, rendering the above equation either integrable, or reducible to a simnple form. Ist. It may happen that by a particular determination of n the equation (XVI.) may be reduced to a single term. Suppose that it should give P (rX)u=U; then if r-ql, ?-q2a &c. are the factors of po(,), we shall, by resolution, have u=Nlvu+N2u2+N.u3 &cD (Tr-q1),u1=U (7'-q2)2=U... On replacing X bvy its value, D-np(D)s', the above system will assume the form u+pI(D)0u=U,, which has already been considered. 2nd. The coefficients p j(r), &c. may be constant. The equation then be1 comes u+a1gU+a. gu+&c.=U, which has been already considered. 3rd. The equation (XVI.) may, perhaps, be reduced to consist of a pair of terms. Suppose that it should give O t U+ PI(%)gu U; this may be reduced to the general form u+()eu= U. As z and ? combine according to the laws of D and 0, the above equation may be treated by Prop. 2 and 3, C. ? 1, and its integrable cases determined accordingly. In illustration of the above theory, we shall investigate the principal integrable cases of the equation (1+ ma +nx4) dp-+ (him d+n )d+ (I"+m"x+n"x)u-O. rhe symbolical form of the above equation is {ID(D-.1) +1'D+1lt}u+ {r(D-1 )(D-.2)+m'(D-I) +m"}}su + {n(D-2)(D-3) +n'(D-2)+-n'}g20U-O0 orI, as it may be written, t(D+ a)(D?(3)u+m(D+z')(D +@)e8 +n(D+e0f)(D5po)?2i-On .

This condition excludes fromn (55.) all values of m from p top+n-1, and from t+ 1 to t+n, i. e. the n first values of m in the series, and the n first values of m following those in the series, because for such values of m (55.) ceases to be a relation connecting n+l consecutive coefficients of the series proposed. Now by the fundamental theorem, if u=:Eumxm= umsrn, then + p,(D)s u.. + pf(D)sndu= { (um+pl(l)umml..+ P (mn)un-f)n, but by (55), the expression um+pi(mn)urn+&c. vanishes except for the values of m above particularized, hence to those values alone of m is the summation in the second member to be extended.

Either of these is an integral of the equation (99.), but I apprehend that the second series only can be regarded as an integral of the original equation. The first series appears to have reference only to the irrelevant factor v. As I am not aware that this distinction has been before observed, and as it appears to affect the validity of the canon which assigns to the integral of an equation of differences just so many arbitrary constants as there are units in the index of its order, I shall make no apology for adducing another illustration. Let us take the equation flu, = 0. (101.) We find as the symbolical form, whence u=.aj='a with the relation mam+am-i=O, or ar,= am-, the lowest value of m being 0, whence X _Z (x-1) _x($-1'(x-2) u=Ctl 1+ . .. + }&C =C(1o =C20* This is obviously a true integral of (IO0.) for all values of x from 0 to c; for when ,v0 it gives ux=C, and when x is any positive quantity, ux=O, precisely as it ought to do. Moreover it involves an arbitrary constant C; but (101.) being of the Oth order, there should, according to the received canon, be no arbitrary constant in its integral. For the solution of the equation x(2 l>Vu=0, we similarly find Us,=a0+ajx+a2x+(vI) +a3G(x-1l)(x-2)+&c., wherein a0, a, are arbitrary constants, and in general 2(mI)am, + a..2 m(m-1) this gives u =a0+a#.rV2a1 l 3aJ-2ax )(xl2)-&c. For the values x0O, x I, the above series is reduced to an arbitrary constant; for all other positive values of x it vanishes. Here then we obtain for an equation of the 0th degree, a solution involving two arbitrary constants, and derived from the two irrelevant factors x and x1. It would be interesting to inquire whether an equation of differences admits of integration by series when fo(m) has equal or imaginary factors. After paying some attention to this question, I am disposed to think that such cases are not conrprehended in any theory analogous to that which I have given for the corresponding class of differential equations.

This happens in the well-known class of equations which becomes (1+al+a~2f+&c.)U =U, and is integrable by resolution of the operating factor, as in equations with constant coefficients.

The general rule for the integration of linear differential equations in series, B. ? 2, requires in a particular case to be slightly modified. If fo(D) involves a pair of factors such as @(D), p(D+r), r being a multiple of the common difference of the values of m, we must in the equation of fo(D)u=O write {p(D)}2 in place of p(D)p(D+r), and similarly when there are more such factors. Thus, in the equation D(D+2)u-q2S20u=O, the form of the assumption for u will be determined by the equation D2u=O, and not by D(D+r)u=O. A slight change of expression would mnake the rule as general as the principle on which it is founded, and reduce to its dominion every case in which a linear differential equation can be integrated by ascending or descending developments. The theory of series infinite in both directions still remains to be examined. Fearful of extending this paper beyond its due limits, I have abstained from introducing any researches not essential to the development of that general method in analysis which it was proposed to exhibit. It may however be remarked that the principles on which the method is founded have a much wider range. They may be applied to the solution of functional equations, to the theory of expansions, and, to a certain extent, to the integration of non-linear differential equations. The position which I am most anxious to establish is, that any great advance in the higher analysis must be sought for by an increased attention to the laws of the combinations of symbols. The value of this principle can scarcely be overrated; and I only regret that in the absence of books, and under circumstances unfavourable for mathematical investigation, I have not been able to do that justice to it in this essay which its importance demands.
