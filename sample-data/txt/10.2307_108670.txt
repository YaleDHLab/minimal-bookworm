[ 429 ] XXIII. A Fifth Memnoir upon Quantics. BY ARTHUR CAYLEY, Esq., F.R.S. Received February 11,-Read March 18, 1858. THE present memoir was originally intended to contain a development of the theories of the covariants of certain binary quantics, viz. the quadric, the cubic, and the quartic; but as regards the theories of the cubic and the quartic, it was found necessary to consider the case of two or more quadrics, and I have therefore comprised such systems of two or more quadrics, and the resulting theories of the harmonic relation and of involution, in the subject of the memoir; and although the theory of homography or of the anharmonic relation belongs rather to the subject of bipartite binary quadrics, yet from its connexion with the theories just referred to, it is also considered in the memoir. The paragraphs are numbered continuously with those of my former memoirs on the subject: Nos. 92 to 95 relate to a single quadric; Nos. 96 to 114 to two or more quadrics, and the theories above referred to; Nos. 115 to 127 to the cubic, and Nos. 128 to 145 to the quartic. The several quantics are considered as expressed not only in terms of the coefficients, but also in terms of the roots,-and I consider the question of the determination of their linear factors,-a question, in effect, identical with that of the solution of a quadric, cubic, or biquadratic equation. The expression for the linear factor of a quadric is deduced from a well-known formula; those for the linear factors of a cubic and a quartic were first given in my "' Note sur les Covariants d'une fonction quadratique, cubique ou biquadratique 'a deux indeterminees," CRELLE, Vol. L. pp. 285 to 287, 1855. It is remarkable that they are in one point of view more simple than the expression for the linear factor of a quadric. 92. In the case, of a quadric the expressions considered are (a, b, 'cIX, Y), (1) ac-b2 , (2) where (1) is the quadric, and (2) is the discriminant, which is also the quadrinvariant, catalecticant, and Hessian. And where it is convenient to do so, I write (1) =U, (2) = j. 93. We have v cta f te di n is ey)a t =Uc which expresses that the evectant of the discriminant i's equal to the quadric; 430 MR. A. CAYLEY'S FIFTH MEMOIR UPON QUANTICS. (a, be cpy iV)2u =4 aEl which expresses that the provectant of the quadric is equal to the discriminant; (a, b, ejbx + ey7-.ax by) =E BUM which expresses that a transmutant of the quadric is equal to the product of the quadric and the discriminant. 94. When the quadric is expressed in terms of the roots, we have a'U=(-MCy)(Q-3y), a-2 0 =l(Oj3)52; and in the case of a pair of equal roots, a'lU =(X ay)" j '0. 95. The problem of the solution of a quadratic equation -is that of finding a linear factor of the quadric. To obtain such linear factor in a symmetrical form, it is necessary to introduce arbitrary quantities which do not really enter into the solution, and the form obtained is thus in some sort more complicated than in the like problem for a cubic or a quartic. The solution depends on the linear transformation of the quadric viz. if we write (a b $+b, y5 X+gy)2=(a b1 01 act y)2? so that a'=(a, b, c:XX, v)2, 6'=(a, b, cap, YXZ(, g), c'(a, b, fog,, ?)29 then aIc' b62 = b62)(Xyp)2 an equation which in a different notation is (a, 6, c y)2x(a, 6, c)2X, Y)2X2(a, 6, cbx, e (X, Y)12= 0 (YX-Xy)0, in which form it is a theorem relating to the quadric and its first and second emanants. The equation shows that (a, b, colic, y:(X, Y) + /c1 (Yx Xy), where (X, Y) are treated as supernumerary arbitrary constants, is a linear factor of (a, b, chXx, y)2, and this is the required solution. 96. In the case of two quadrics, the expressions considered are (a, b, C JX, y)2, (l) (a', 6', c'(x, y)2, (2) ac-b62 (3) ac2bb'+ca', (4) 0!.tl _ 12 X(5) MR. A.

And where it is convenient to do so, I write (1) = U, (2) = U', (3)= 0, (4) Q (5) = 0', (6) R, (7)H (8) =W (9) 0. 97. The Jacobian (7) may also be written in the form Y25 -yaw ,2 5 a, b, c at, ', c' The Resultant (6) may be written in the form a, 2b, c a, 2b, c, a', 2b', c' a', 2b', c MDcccLVIII. 3 M 432 MR. A. CAYLEY'S FIFTH MEMOIR UPON QUANTICS. and also, taken negatively, in the form 4(ab'a'b)(bc' b-c) (ad aC)2, which is the discriminant of the Jacobian; and in the form 4(ac2)(a'c'b2) -(ac -2bb'+ca')2, which is the discriminant of the Intermediate. 98. We have the following relations:(a, b, c(b'x+c'y, -a'x-b 6y)2= (atc' b12) (a, b6, c)X, y)2 +(a c'2bb'+ca') (a', V, c'(vx, y)2, (a', by c':Cx + c, -axs by )2= +(ac' -2bb'+ca') (a, b, cXx, y)2 -(ac -b2) (a', 6', c'jwX, y)2, and, moreover (ac h2, ad -2bb'+ca', a'c' h'2U', U)2 --{(ab'db, ac' -ac, be'-V'cAx, y)2}21 an equation, the interpretation of which will be considered in the sequel. 99. The most important relations which may exist between the two quadrics are First, when the connective vanishes, or ad2bb'+ca'=0, in which case the two quadrics are said to be harmonically related: the nature of this relation will be further considered. Secondly, when R=O, the two quadrics have in this case a common root, which is given by any of the equations, x2 2:xy: f='a R :bR :a0R =_'a : baR : bR =be'-6'c: ca'ca: ab'a'b. The last set of values express that the Jacobian is a perfect square, and that the two roots are each equal to the common root of the two quadrics. The preceding values of the ratios 8 2xy : y2 are consistent with each other in virtue of the assumed relation R-= 0 hence in general the functions 46aR . beR ( )bR)a, eaRb. 1btR-bR . a'R5 &C. all of them contain the Resultant R as a factor. It is easy to see that the Jacobian is harmonically related to each of the quadrics; in fact we have identically a (be-b'c)+b (ca'c'a) + c (alla'b)= 0, a'(bdb1c) + b'(ca'c'a) + c'(ab'a'b)= 0, which contain the theorem in question. MR. A. CAYLEY'S FIFTH MEMOIR UPON QUTANTICS. 433 100. When the quadrics are expressed in terms of the roots, we have as-1U =(X oay)(X Py), 4-2 0 ]5) 2(aa')Q= 2 4p + 2 &3' (a +X)(m' +i3'), 4ar-2o0l=f Otp) (aal)-2R (z &)(cs 0')(f3oe')(j3 -3) (aa)11H = y2 2yx , 2 1, ez+P, ,f3 101. The comparison of the last-mentioned value of R with the expression in terms of the roots obtained from the equation -R=4o ?O'-.Q2 gives the identical equation (Ca-0)2(t~'f_3't)2 _{2f 2 + 2&'4'(a +f)(' +f')} 2 = 4( a')(&, -3)Q3 ')(-'), which may be easily verified. 102. We have identically -=-2(rz-a')(a t)( 3(0 a 1' = 2(p3 o')( -(3') -((3v)(2p v-'P') =2(al v)(o'--) ('((2a'ta-) = 2(p3/a)(13 -) ( a ')(2pf -o a 3) and the equation Q=cad'-2bb'+ca'= 0 may consequently be written in the several forms 2 1 1 = 1+1 2 1 1 ; -a +1 2 1 1 /13I-a' /31o+/1 -B /' so that the roots (a, t3), (a', f') are harmonically related to each other, and hence the notion of the harmonic relation of the two quadrics. 103. In the case where the two quadrics have a common root =&a', a-'U =(X-ey)(-fPY), d'1U'(XaY)(X-(3Y)M 434 MR. A.

In the case of three quadrics, of the expressions which are or might be considered, it will be sufficient to mention (a 9 b , c B(X, Y)21l (a', ', CcIXX y)2, (2) (a", bit, ctXx, Y)2 (3) a, b, c , (4) /to bi I e a", b" ell where (1), (2), (3) are the quadrics themselves, and (4) is an invariant, linear in the coefficients of each quadric. And where it is convenient to do so, I write (1)-, U, (2) = U', (3) U", (4) =Q. 105. The equation 1 =0 is, it is clear, the condition to be satisfied by the coefficients of the three quadrics, in order that there may be a syzygetic relation xU + P(U' +VU"= 0, or what is the same thing, in order that each quadric may be an intermediate of the other two quadrics; or again, in order that the three quadrics may be in Involution. Expressed in terms of the roots, the relation is 1, c=+H, a0; 1, x't+/3', &I'd and when this equation is satisfied, the three pairs, or as it is usually expressed, the six quantities a, p; a,[3'; ",/3",are said to be in involution, or to form an involution. And the two perfectly arbitrary pairs as, 3; ae', P3 considered as belonging to such a system, may be spoken of as an involution. If the two terms of a pair are equal, e. g. if os" =W/3"=d, then the relation is 1, 2, 02 =0; +, asiol and such a system is sometimes spoken of as an involution of five terms. Considering MR. A. CAYLEY'S FIFTH MEMOIR UPON QUANTICS. 435 the pairs (a, 3), (a', [') as given, there are of course two values of 4 which satisfy the preceding equation; and calling these 4, and d,,, then 4, and 4,, are said to be the sibiconjugates of the involution ax, A; ax', ('. It is easy to see that d,, 4,, are the roots of the equation H= 0, where H is the Jacobian of the two quadrics U and U' whose roots are (a, (13), (act, 13'). In fact, the quadric whose roots are 4,, 4,, is Y2, 2yx, 2 1, c+I, cq3 af +pf, als 1, ds+13', Mitt3 which has been shown to be the Jacobian in question. But this may be made clearer as follows:-If we imagine that A, ( are determined in such manner that the intermediate XU+pU' may be a perfect square, then we shall have XU+pU'-a"(x-dy)2, where d denotes one or other of the sibiconjugates D,, 4,, of the involution. But the condition in order that XU+pjU' may be a square is (ac62, acd-26b'+ca', ad'cl/2X, )2; and observing that the equation A.: ?4 = U': U implies kU +uU' = 0 = a"(X dy)2, it is obvious that the function (ac-b2, ac'-2bb'+ca', a'C'byl2i U, -U) 2 must be to a factor pros equal to (a _ y)2(X _ d4,y)2* But we have identically (ac-b6, ac26bb'+ca', ao' b62JU', U)2= {(al a'b, ada'c, be'b'cX, y)2}2, and we thus see that (aOy), (x-4,,y) are the factors of the Jacobian. 106. It has been already remarked that the Jacobian is harmonically related to each of the quadrics U, U'; hence we see that the sibiconjugates 0S 4,, of the involution ar, 03, at', 3' are a pair harmonically related to the pair as, (, and also harmonically related to the pair ax', 13', and this properly might be taken as the definition for the sibiconjugates 0d1 4,, of an involution of four terms. And moreover, a, (3; a', (' being given, and 4,, 4,, being determined as the sibiconjugates of the involution, if a"tt, (" be a pair harmonically related to 4,, 4,,, then the three pairs ax, (; a', (3'; P" (3will form an involution; or what is the same thing, any three pairs ax, a3; ex', a3'; ox', (3", each of them harmonically related to a pair 4,, 0,,, will be an involution, and 4,, 4,, will be the sibiconjugates of the involution. 107. In particular, if a, 3 be harmonically related to 4,, 4,,, then it is easy to see that 4,, 4, may be considered as harmonically related to I,, 4,,, and in like manner 4,,, 4,, will be harmonically related to 4,, 4,,; that is, the pairs 4,, 4,; 4 ,/,, and a, [ will form an involution. This comes to saying that the equation 1, 24, 42 =0 1, 24,,, 02 1, e+[, ex[ 436 MR. A. CAYLEY'S FIFTH MEMOIR UPON QUANTICS. is equivalent to the harmonic relation of the pairs 0?,, 8,,; and in fact the determinant is (di oi) 2aP+2d~d,j_(as+Adj(0+d,,)) which proves the theorem in question. 108. Before proceeding further, it is proper to consider the equation 15 , A'eM'= I, 0, 181e o1 1, 7, 7, 77 1, 8, If, ba which expresses that the sets (osa, , yr 6) and (z', /', y', is) are homographic; for although the homographic equation may be considered as belonging to the theory of the bipartite quadric (x -ay) (xc&'y), yet the theory of involution cannot be completely discussed except in connexion with that of homography. If we write A' (I' y')( -'), B'(y' -e')(/3's')) C'=(z' 3)(1'then we have A+B+C =0, A'+ B'+ C' 0 and thence BC'-B'C = CA'--CA =AB'-A'B; and either of these expressions is in fact equal to the last-mentioned determinant, as may be easily verified. Hence, when the determinant vanishes, we have A: B: C=A': B': C'. Any one of the three ratios A: B: C, for instance the ratio B: C= (Ma) (a3 a is said to be the anharmonic ratio of the set (ce, /3, ,), and consequently the two sets (ac, /3, y, I) and (a', 3', y', b') will be homographically related when the anharmonic ratios (that is, the corresponding anharmonic ratios) of the two sets are equal. If any one of the anharmonic ratios be equal to unity, then the four terms of the set B taken in a proper manner in pairs, will be harmonics; thus the equation =-1 gives (y-At) (I3 -1 which is reducible to 2cos +2/Sy(OG+ 8)(,B+ y)=0, which expresses that the pairs a, 6 and /3 y are harmonics. 109. Now returning to the theory of involution (and for greater convenience taking a', & &c. instead of a, /3 &c. to represent the terms of the same pair), the pairs a, a'; 3, /3'; MR. A. CAYLEY'S FIFTH MEMOIR UPON QUANTICS. 437 y, y'; b, 3' &c. will be in involution if each of the determinants formed with any three lines of the matrix 1, i3+1', [313, 1, w , A', &c. vanishes: but this being so, the determinant .1, cowl ~ cY 7, CY 1, ye ye rr' 1, 3, Yl bb which is equal to ca, 1, &a+ a', CAh' ly 1, l b+b 33'Ill will vanish, or the two sets (a, 1, y, 5) and (a', 1'I, ,') will be homographic; that is, if any number of pairs are in involution, then, considering four pairs and selecting in any manner a term out of each pair, these four terms and the other terms of the same four pairs form respectively two sets, the two sets so obtained will be homographic. 110. In particular, if we have only three pairs ac, cet; 3,1 3'; ty, ', then the sets oa, 13, 7, &9 and ce', I3, y', a will be homographic; in fact, the condition of homography is 1 a, ae, am/ -0O P1 019 PPt 1, 3, 713, 1y 1, ys, y', y7oes which may be written o, 1, O+Oa', OGai =0, y, 1, 7+7', rr' oex' 1, ex+ex, andx or what is the same thing, 1, +a', d1 =0, 13 , 1, 1(3+13', 1313' ly lyy, 7+7', 77 x'-x, 0, 0 , 0 , 438 MR. A. CAYLEY'S FIFTH MEMOIR UPON QUANTICS. so that the first-mentioned relation is equivalent to (M'-M) 1, rx+aOt, OI O s =0, v7 +t matIry 1, rumr'/ ry' and the two sets give rise to an involution. The condition of homography as expressed by the equality of the anharmonic ratios may be written at{ tal aI-P/ et f a. Cc-y mt t=c-e~c--3 or multiplying out, (o3)(c -i')@ y)(o' i r) _(M .f3)(z' -t)(M_ y)(z' et) 0, which is a form for the equation of involution of the three pairs. But this and the other transformations of the equation of involution is best obtained by a different method, as will be presently seen. 111. Imagine now any number of pairs as, a'); /3, /3' r r'; P, ', &c. in involution, and let x, y, z, w be the fourth harmonics of the same quantity X with respect to the pairs as, e'; /3, /3'; ry, ' and 6, 6' respectively; then the anharmonic ratios of the set (x, y, z, w) will be independent of x, or what is the same thing, if x', y', z', w' are the fourth harmonics of any other quantity a' with respect to the same four pairs, the sets (x, y, z, w) and (x', y', z', w') will be homographic, or we shall have 1, x, a', ax'I aI , XX =0. 1, yo yIp 1, z, z', zdz' 1, w, wo', wwt' It will be sufficient to show this in the case where X is anything whatever, but Xa has a determinate value, say Xa=oo; and since if all the terms a, at', &c. are diminished by the same quantity X the relations of involution and homography will not be affected, we may without loss of generality assume -=0, but in this case and the equation to be proved is I1 -ant,,a p+, 0 v+y | 1 r+, tY~ y tt 1, En +t, do which is obviously a consequence of the equations which express the involution of the four pairs. MR. A. CAYLEY'S FIFiTH MEMOIR UPON QUANTICS. 439 A set homographic with x, y, z, w, which are the fourth harmonics of any quantity whatever x. with respect to the pairs in involution, co, ce'; V3, f3'; y, y'; 8, I', is said to be homographic with the four pairs, and we have thus the notion of a set of single quantities homographic with a set of pairs in involution. This very important theory is due to M. CHASLES. 112. Let r; s; t, be the anharmonic ratios of a set ar, f3, y, 6, and let r,; s,; t, be the anharmonic ratios (corresponding or not corresponding) of a set , j3,, 7,, 7 ,. And suppose that r'; s'; Is; r,; s; t; r t r'; s; Is'; r ; 8; t r; s"; t', are the analogous quantities for three other pairs of sets; then an equation such as Ir r, Lrrl =O. S SI Ss, or as it is more conveniently written, ss,, rs,, r,s, rr, =0 // /1 /, / r'r s8,, rs,, r,s rr, 88,8, r~s, r~s ,r I/I // /1/ /1/ /1/ III I/ I 88,, rs, , r,s, rr, is a relation independent of the particular ratios r: s which have been chosen for the anharmonic ratios of the sets; this is easily shown by means of the equations r+s+t=0, r,+s,+t,=O, which connect the anharmonic ratios. The equation in fact expresses a certain relation between four sets (z, P, V, 6) and four other sets (ce,, 1,, I,); a relation which may be termed the relation of the homography of the anharmonic ratios of four and four sets: the notion of this relation is also due to M. CHASLES. 113. The general relation 1, oc'+j3, c'( = may be exhibited in a great variety of forms. In fact, if the determinant is denoted by T, then multiplying by this determinant the two sides of the identical equation iU2, -U, 1 =(u-v)(v-w)(w-U), w2, -w, 1 ql 2 Ma~ we obtain (in oc")(u-1A'), (v&")(v"), (w-It")(W -13) MDCCCLVIII.3 440 MR. A. CAYLEY'S FIFTH MEMOIR UPON QUANTICS. If, for example, u= o, v=f3, then we have T(cM -1)O(ce o')(oM-[')(1c")(1 -1")+(13 ')((3-')($e e")(cM-13") And again, if m=o, v=&o', 'w=', then we have Y = (a 3)(c M3)(Ct" -13') + (oG 13')(C (3")(CC -13). Or putting T 0, the first equation gives (a -al) (a/) (-a ')(' and the second equation gives ( 13"' f3)(" /3') _ ( I 13')(&/' j!/)(X1 _3), which are both of them well-known forms. 114. A corresponding transformation applies to the equation 1, o, (Z M, =~ 0, 1, 1, 1', 131' 1, yyS y 7,b , rr/ which expresses the homography of two pairs. In fact, calling the determinant T and representing by V the similar determinant s8, -8, 8, 1 Utt, U, -U, 1 V I VI1 V vv', .-v, -v6, 1 which, equated to zero, would express the homography of the sets (s, t, u, v) and (8', t', U', v'), we have (tn ct)(U ci ), (tj)(t' -('), (t y)(u' -y1), (tn )(u' -3t (V-OC(Vt06),(VP)(V'-P'), (V7)(V,-,Y9, (V ;)(V'-Yt). which gives various forms of the equation of homography.

A. CAYLEY'S FIFTH MEMOIR UPON QUANTICS. 441 which is, in fact, one of the equations which express the equality of the anharmonic ratios of (oI, 3, r, b) and (ox', P', y', b'). 115. In the case of a cubic, the expressions considered are(a, b, c, dax, YY3 (1) (a-I 2, ad-bc, bd-c2Ox,&)2, (2) F-a2d + 3abe2b3, 3 -abd+2ac2 b2c, +acd-2b2d+bc, 2 X (3) +ad2 -3bcd+2c3 9 a d2 -6abcd+4ac3 +4b3d3b2c3, (4) where (1) is the cubic, (2) is the quadricovariant or Hessian, (3) is the cubicovariant, and (4) is the quartinvariant or discriminant. And where it is convenient to do so, I write (1)= U (2) = H, (3) =D, (4) = 0, so that we have 4)2 oU2+4H3= . 116. The Hessian may be written under the form (ax+ by)(cx + dy) (bx+cy)2, (which, indeed, is the form under which qua Hessian it is originally given), and under the form Y ,2, YX X2 a, b, c b, c, d The cubicovariant may be written under the form {2(ac -b2)X+ (ad-be)y}(bX2 + 2exy +dy2) -{(ad-bc)x +2(bd c2)y} (aX2+2bxy1+cy2), that is, as the Jacobian of the cubic and Hessian; and under the form 60 (a lb _X X )3 )3 that is, as the evectant of the discriminant. The discriminant, taken negatively, may be written under the form +4(ac -b2)(bd c2) -(ad-bc)2, that is, as the discriminant of the Hessian. 3 N2 442 MR. A. CAYLEY'S FIFTH MEMOIR UPON QUANTICS. 117. We have (a, b, c, dXbx2+2exy+dy2, -a2-2bxy-cy2)3=UD, which expresses that a transmutant of the cubic is the product of the cubic and the cubicovariant. The equation {p Ea b _X)3}2 0 ?=2U2 expresses that the second evectant of the discriminant is the square of the cubic. The equation d2 , -3cd , 3bd+ 6c2 , -3bc+2ad =27 02 -30d , _32+ 12bd, -3ad-6be, X3ac+6b2 -3bd+6c2, -3ad-6bc, -3b2+12ac, -3ab -3bc12ad, -3ac+6b2, 3cab , a2 expresses that the determinant formed with the second differential coefficients of the discriminant gives the square of the discriminant. The covariants of the intermediate olU+Pr3I are as follows, viz.118. For the Hessian, we have H(alU+P3I)=(1, 0, a (3)21H (Q62 _(2 0)H; for the cubicovariant, )(D6U+fA))=(0, 0, 0, -02 2A 3)3U +(1, 0, 0, 1P)3) -(a,52_2 0 )(aD+p0 DU); and for the discriminant, o(aU+3)F)=(1, 0, -20, 0, 02X i)4@ (a2_p2 0o)20, where on the left-hand sides I have, for greater distinctness, written H, &c. to denote the functional operation of taking the Hessian, &c. of the operand clU+13cP. In particular, if s=0, O.=1, Ho= o0. 119. Solution of a cubic equation. The question is to find a linear factor of the cubic (a', b, el denX Y)3, and this can be at once effected by means of the relation D2 0U2=-4H3 MR. A. CAYLEY'S FIFTH MEMOIR UPON QUANTICS. 443 between the covariants. The equation in fact shows that each of the expressions '(CD+UVO), 2(@-UVO) is a perfect cube, and consequently that the cube root of each of these expressions is a linear function of (x, y). The expression 2((D+ UV ) 2((DV-u0z is consequently a linear function of x, y, and it vanishes when U= 0, that is, the expression is a linear factor of the cubic. It may be noticed here that the cubic being a(x-ay)(x -3Py)(x-yy), then we may write_ ___ 3~~~~ 3 ( V Y 4+ UV a ) 2 u V ) a 3(c c2)( coy) where c is an imaginary cube root of unity: this will appear from the expressions which will be presently given for the covariants in terms of the roots. 120. Canonical form of the cubic. The expressions -Q(( + UV! 0), Q(DUV'O) are perfect cubes; and if we write ()+UV,/ )=V x3 -((?UV /)= /y3, then we have UI x3+y3, (D=V/ o} (X3 y3) and thence also H1 -/Oxy. 121. When the cubic is expressed in terms of the roots, we have aU (X y)(x PA( -,Yy); and then putting for shortness A= (f3-r)Qr -a B = (r-)(x-.--?), so that A+B+C=0, we have r-2H = I (A2+B2+C2)(BC+CA+AB), a:-3(D = -2 I(B -C)(C -A)(A B a4 0 _( y )'(fy Mt)2(V_ P)2 122.

It may be observed that we have a-6 SU2=_-__A2B2C2, which, with the above values of H, 4P in terms of A, B, C and the equation A+B+C=0, verifies the equation q)2_C 3U2+4H3=O, which connects the covariants. In fact, we have identically, (BC)2(CA)2(A -B)2= -4(A+B+C)3ABC+(A+B+C)2(BC+CA+AB)2+ 18(A+B+C)(BC+CA+AB)ABC -4(BC+CA+AB)3 -27A2B2C2 by means of which the verification can be at once effected. 124. If, as before, c is an imaginary cube root of unity, then we may write 27a-3 = -(B-C)(C-A)(A-B) 27a-3UVs 0= 3(c4W2)ABC, and these values give 27a -32I (+UV a)U {(c(+ v2/3+ W7) X+(Pyr+ W2rc%+ )y}3 27a-3I ()-DUV.3) = (a+6,., + )x+(Py+ W7 +'W2a4)y}3, and we thence obtain / (l+U ^/ a)-A/ ((I)-UV S/z)=3a(ZZ){ ZM) which agrees with a former result. 125. The preceding formulhe show without difficulty, that each factor of the cubic covariant is the harmonic of a factor of the cubic with respect to the other two factors of the cubic; and moreover, that the factors of the cubic and the cubicovariant form together an involution having for sibiconjugates the factors of the Hessian. In fact, the harmonic of x-o y with respect to (x-Py)(x-yy) is (2-P-ry)x+(2Py-ryoa-oP)y, which is a factor of the cubicovariant; the product of the pair of harmonic factors is MR. A. CAYLEY'S FIFTH MEMOIR UPON QUANTICS. 445 and multiplying this by 3 -y, and taking the sum of the analogous expressions, this sum vanishes, or the three pairs form an involution. That the Hessian gives the sibiconjugates of the involution is most readily shown as follows:-the last-mentioned quadric may be written -(_a+f3+r)+ 3a )x2+2 (xq3+cr+f(ry-ox(os+f3+r))xy+ (-3apiyr+ a(oq +o Mr+p7))Y 2 which is equal to (3a +3a)x2 +2 (3a-3 a x)y+ (3 +3)a Y2 or, throwing out the factor 3a-1, to (b+at, 2c-2bt%, d+cc(x, y)2, which is harmonically related to the Hessian (ac-b2, ad-be, bd-c(Tx, y)2; and in like manner the other two pairs of factors will be also harmonically related to the Hessian. 126. In the case of a pair of equal roots, we have a-'U (x-zy)2(Xryy); a-21H= _ y)2Q(X-_y)2, a-3(D)2 (&_Iy)3(Xcy)3 E =0. And in the case of all the roots equal, we have au = (X_ MYV aU =(-oy)3, H-O P=O. =O. 127. In the solution of a biquadratic equation we have to consider the cubic equation z~3-M(z--1)=O. The cubic here is (1, 0, -M, Mjw, 1)', or what is the same thing, (1, O.-1M, MidW, 1)3; the Hessian is M(_ 9 19 _OMEN 1)2; the cubicovariant is M -lgM 3 M+ _M23(Wl 1)3; and the discriminant is M2(1 _ AM). 128.

And where it is convenient to do so, I write (1) = U, (2) I (3) _ H, (4) J (5) 0. The preceding covariants are connected by the equation JU3 IU2H+4H3= -D2 The discriminant is not an irreducible invariant, its value is E= 13-27J2=a3e3+ &c., for which see Table No. 12. 129. It is for some purposes convenient to arrange the expanded expression of the discriminant in powers of the middle coefficient c. We thus have o= a3e3 _12a2bde227a2d4 6ab2d2e27b4e2 64b3d3 + c(54a2d2e + 54ab2e2+ 108abd3+ 108b3de) -C2( 18a2e2 180abde+ 36b2d2) +C3(54ad2 _ 54b2e) + 4(81ae). 130. Solution of a biquadratic equation. We have to find a linear factor of the quartic (a, b, c, d, etx, y)4. The equation JU3-IU2H+4H3= _ 1I)2, putting for shortness 13 may be written MR. A. CAYLEY' S FIFTH MEMOIR UPON QUANTICS. 447 Hence, if we) w2l 3 are the roots of (1, 0, ._M, MjZMi 1)3= 0, -the expressions IH-aJU III-.-2JU IH-,3JU are each of them squares; write (W2-W,)(IH wjU)=X', (w,-w,)(IH-w2JU) = Y', (UlW2)(IHIwJU) = Z2 so that, identically, and consequently X + Y, XY are each of them squares. The expression ax+pY+rz will be a square if only C2?I2+r2 =0, which may be seen by writing it under the form (a + 13)(XY) + -!( -3)(X + 1Y) YiVX2+Y2; and in particular, writing V'02-W3, VW 3> Vz,/ 2 for a, A, Ay, the expression (V2Z3)V1111-Wl'JU+ (W3 'M)VIlzS2JU+ (WlzW2)VIHSJU is a square; and since the product of the different values is a multiple of U2 (this is most readily perceived by observing that the expression vanishes for U= 0), the expression is the square of a linear factor of the quartic. 131. To complete the solution: f wS, 3 are the roots of the cubic equation (1,0, .-3M, M)CO, 1)3_0; and hence, putting for shortness, 3=_{( Ad1 Mv IMI M+ 2 23tI tJU 3+V /l-M_ l,4,-M, M3rIH, JU)3l Q3=2M(-1, 9M, 3M+-27-M2, 1H JU)3 _Vj__4,M I ,3M M3IHjTU)3l we have (x being an imaginary cube root of unity) And 'if 1( 2)(2 z3)(IH 1JU) = P Q.

It may be proper to add that -71Po+ Q0, =oj P +. 92QO) _ V53 = o2po + O Q0. 132. The solution gives at once the canonical form of the quartic; in fact, writing X~sY=2s/(2S3)(W3--ffj/-TX XY=2v(w -) _I)V y where X, Y have their former significations, we find, by a simple reduction, IH-ziT1XIJ= (zg3-..zj)J(X2+y2)2 TH -a JU= IH -,a JU= (VT2 --3) J(X2 J y2)2 IH-w3;U=_(W '-S) *3 -W1); X2y2, and thence putting W2 (W W) (w)2po + wQo) (2po wQ0) 7 we have U=X4+y4+ 6x2y2 which is the form required. 133. The Hessian may be written under the form that iah acs, aabs t a t. that is, as the evectant of the cubinvariant. MR. A. CAYLEY'S FIFTH MEMOIR UPON QUANTICS. 449 The cubicovariant may be obtained by writing the quartic under the form (ax+by, bx+cy, cx+dy, dx+eyzx, y)' and treating the linear functions as coefficients, or considering this as a cubic, the cubicovariant of the cubic gives the cubicovariant of the quartic. If we represent the cubicovariant by cD = (a, b, c) d, e, f, gyp,' Y)6 then we have identically, ag-9ce+8d2=0; and moreover forming the quadrinvariant of the sextic, we find ag-6bf+15ce-1Od2= JO, where 0 is the discriminant of the quartic. From these two equations we find bf4ce+3d2= __-_ ? which is an expression given by Mr. SALMON: it is the more remarkable as the lefthand side is the quadrinvariant of (b, c, d, e, fly, y)4, which is not a covariant of the quartic. It may be noticed also that we have af3be+2cd0 bg3cf+2de=O. 134. The covariants of the intermediate aU+ 631H of the quartic and Hessian are as follows, viz.The quadrinvariant is I(oaU+ 60H)=(I, 1 8J, 32o,}) the cubinvariant is J(aU+ 61H) (J.

The conditions in order that the expression may vanish are obviously 6(ac-b2): 3(ad-6be): ae+2bd-3c2: 3(be-cd): 6(ce-d2): 9J a : 6 c : d e : I, MR. A. CAYLEY'S FIFTH MEMOIR UPON QUANTICS. 451 conditions which imply that the several determinants 6(ac-b2), 3ad-be, ae+2bd-3c2, 3(be-cd), 6(ce d2) a , b , c , d , e all of them vanish. If for a moment we write 6H1= (a', 6', c', d', e'Wx, y)', then the determinants are at c', d', e a, b, c, d, e we have identically ad' -a'd= 3(bc'-b'c), eb' e'b =3(dc'd'c ), ae'ate =3(bd'-b'd), and the ten determinants thus reduce themselves to seven determinants only, these in fact being, to mere numerical factors pres, the coefficients of the cubicovariant; this perfectly agrees with a subsequent result, viz. that the cubicovariant vanishes identically when the quartic is a perfect square. 137. It may be remarked that the equation 6IH-9JU=O will be satisfied identically if c-= ce= fbd-(c-p)(+2'p) where p is arbitrary; the quartic is in this case the square of (/c-P /c-, 7 Y)2 If with the conditions in question we combine the equation I= 0 (which in this case implies also J=0), we obtain P=O, and consequently a b c d or the quartic will be a complete fourth power. It is easy to express in terms of the coefficients a', 6', c', d', e' of 6H the different determinants a, b, c, d ', b, c, d, e we have in fact ae =bd =(c'+46'd' 3c2), ac-b2 =*a', ad-bc _ eb', be-cd' a V, be-ed2 le' 452 MR.

The equation I=O gives A: B: C=1: w: g1 where w is an imaginary cube root of unity; the factors of the quartic may be said in this case to be Symmetric Harmonies. The equation J=O gives one of the three equations, A=B, B=C, C=A; in this case a pair of factors of the quartic are harmonics with respect to the other pair of factors. If we have simultaneously 1=-, J=-, then A=B=C=O and in this case three of the factors of the quartic are equal. 144. If any two of the linear factors of the quartic are considered as forming, with the other two linear factors, an involution, the sibiconjugates of the involution make up a quadratic factor of the cubicovariant; and considering the three pairs of sibiconjugates, or what is the same thing, the six linear factors of the cubicovariant, the factors of a pair are the sibiconjugates of the involution formed by the other two pairs of factors. In fact, the sibiconjugates of the involution formed by the equations (X my) (X )0, (X Y) (X 0yare found by means of the Jacobian of these two functions, viz. of the quadrics (2, 6-a 2l (ay)2 (2, -f-7, 2Iy:rx, y)2, which is (b+ ' A 7) -t+ 7 8M _P7)-(6+a)$:( y)2) viz. a quadratic factor of the cubicovariant; and forming the other two factors, there is no difficulty in seeing that any one of these is the Jacobian of the other two, 145.
