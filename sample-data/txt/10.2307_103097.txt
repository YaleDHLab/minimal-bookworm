(523) III. The Natural History and Description of the Phaenicopterus or Flamingo; with two Views of the Head, and three of the Tongue, of that beautiful and uncommon Bird. By James Douglass, M. D. Reg. Soc. S. N O M E N. IT was the famous Comical Poet Aristophanes, that first makes mention of this Bird by the Name of ~ (a), and not long after it is called ~ ~ (b) by Philostratus in his Life of Apollonius Tyaneus. Apicius, Plinius, Suetonius, Fuvenal, and other Latin Writers, retain the Greek Word, and call it Phaenicopterus. Bellonius (c) says, that in French it is named le Flement or Flambant. Scaliger affirms, that in Provence they call it Flammant: And (d) Gesner says it may be called Avis Rubra per excellentiam (e) Aldrovandus writes, that in Sardinia it goes by the Name of Fiamingo; and de Laet tells us, the Spaniards in the West Indies call it Flamenco. Dr. Charlton and Dr. Grew convert the Greek Appellation into English, naming it the Phaenicopter: And Sir Hans Sloane, in his Catalogue of Jamaica Birds annexed to Mr. Ray's Synopsis Avium, stiles it the Flamingo. (f) Du Tertre calls it le Flamand, which differs but little from the Name given it by Bellonius: And (a) Aristoph. Aves. Sc. A. (b) Philost. Lib. 8. Pag. 387. Edit. Paris. 1605. fol. (c) Bellon. Histoire des Oyseaux, Lib. 8. Cap. 8. (d) Gesner Hist. Anim. Lib. 3. (e) Aldrov. Ornithol. Tom. III. Lib. 20. Cap. 4. (f) Hist. des Isles, &c. p. 300. to (524) to mention no more. (g) Du Hamel says 'tis commonly call'd Becharu in France. Etymologia. All these differing Names may be easily accounted for, from the Colour most praedominant in its Wings. Thus Martial (Epigram 58. Lib. III.) says of this Bird: Nomenque debet quae rubentibus pennis. And again (Epigr. 71. Lib. XIII.) he makes it give the true Derivation of its own Name; Dat mihi penna rubens nomen. The Greek Name is compounded of two, viz ~~, puniceus, ruber, and ~, Ala, a Wing, quod sit rubentibus Alis; which thing in different Words is exprest as follows, by the several Authors I have consulted. Bellonius says 'tis called in French Flambant, not only from the Date-Colour of its Wings, a Dactylorum colore, i. e. a Scarlet or light red, like the Fruit of the Palm or Date~ Tree called in Greek ~; but also from the Lustre of the Colour resembling Flame: or as Aldrovandus has it, quod velut ignis instar ejus rubedo emicet. The Words of Gesner are, Ego Gallicum nomen a rubro & flammeo rostri, crurum, pennarumque in aliquibus partibus colore inditum sse conjecerim: aut forte quoniam ex Flandria hyeme ad Narbonensis Provinciae maritima volat; nam Flan~ drum Galli Flammant appellant: vel a corporis proceritate, quales solent esse Flandri. Mr.Willoughby (h) says the French name it thus rather from the flammeous Colour of the Wings and Feet, than that it comes in the Winter Time (g) Hist. de l' Acad. Royale, p. 213. (h) Ornithologiae, Lib. III. Sect. 2. Cap. 1. from (525) from Flanders. For he believes there was scarce ever seen in Flanders a Bird of that kind; so far are they from being common there, and flying from thence into other Countries. (k) Dr. Grew believes it named in Greek from the Scarlet Colour of its Wings; and Flamment in French for the same Reason. Du Hamel explains its Name Becharu by Aratri-rostrum, (quasi Bec-Charrue) quoniam rostrum ejus aratri instar inflectitur. Genus. All Authors, from Aristophanes down to Aldrovandus, have accounted the Phaenicopterus a Bird of the Palmipede or web~footed kind; and tho' this last named Author will not allow it to be so, yet he is forced to own that it is not a true Fissipede or digitated Fowl; nam & membranae digitos sepientis quoddam habet rudimentum,are his own Words. Dr. Charlton only, among all the later Natural Historians, has approved of his Division, and accordingly ranked the Phaenicopter in the Class of Aquatick Fissipedes. But that it is a Water-Fowl all agree; Aristophanes calls it ~, i. e. palustris; and Aldrovandus says of it, Avis est aquas amans: not to mention others. Differentiae. I find Authors are silent as to the different Sorts of this Bird, only Aldrovandus gives us two Figures thereof that are not alike. Locus Natalis. This Bird is found in three of the Principal Parts of the World, that is, in Africa, America and Europe. Heliodorus (AEthiop. Lib. 6.) calls it ~ ~, a Bird of the Nile; and the old Scholiast upon Juvenal (Sat. xi. ver. 139.) affirms, that abundans est in Africa; and Du Hamel's Words are, Inter animantes (~) Museaum Reg. Soc. p. 67. M m m m quae (526) quae sua mole commendantur, Avis illa ex AEgyto allata est, quam Veteres ob plumas in Alis rubeas Phaenicopterum dixere. John de Laet writes, that there is an Abundance of them in the Island of Cuba, as also at the Isle called Rocca, lying on the Coast of the Province of Venezuela in South America; and Rochfort says the same thing of the Island of St. Domingo. (l) Dampier saw some few of them at Sal, one of the Cape Virde Islands: He hath likewise seen some of them at Rio la Hacha; also at an Island near the Main of America right against Querisao, call'd by the Privateers Flamingo-Key, from the Multitude of these Fowls that breed there; and he never saw of their Nests and Young but there only. Tho' these winged Creatures live for the most part in those hot Countries, yet they sometimes visit us here in Europe, and so may be accounted amongst the Migratory Kind or Birds of Passage, which is confirmed by the Testimonies of several Authors: For~ Bellonius told us long ago, migrant ultra mare, and are often taken in Italy, and oftner in Spain. (m) Gassendus says they are frequently catched in the fenny Grounds and Marshes about Arles in Provence, upon the Rhone. Gesnerus. Quidam mihi retulit avem hanc non procul a Monte-Pessulano capi. He says in another Place, that they swim in Flocks not far from the Shore in Mediterraneo Mari Gallico. Willoughby writes, that in hard Weather in the Winter Time, it comes over to the Coast of Provence (and is often taken about Martiquez, a Sea-Port Town in that Country) and inLanguedoc,and is frequently found about Montpelier: But whence it comes and where it is bred, (l) Damp. New Voyage round the World, p. 67. ~ (m) Gass. Vita Peiresc. Lib. II. in fine. to (527) to me, says he, is unknown. N. B. This Passage is not in the Latin Edition of his Works, but added to the English which was published two Years after the first. However, he says positively, that they don't come from Flanders, where they are so far from being common, as some alledge, that there never was one seen in that Country. (n) Dr.Charleton informs his Reader that he was presented with the Skin of one of these Birds, well stuffed and dried, by a Gentleman at his Return from the University of Montpelier, near which Place it had been taken. Hujus exuvias rite conditas infertasque mihi dono dedit praenobilis Juvenis D. Thomas Crew Eq. Aurat. (o) Dr Lister says, Frequens est Phoenicopterus in paludibus maritimis ad mare Mediterraneum Provinciae & Languedociae. Whether this Bird were known to Aristotle is a Question: for all our Writers of Natural History agree, that the Phoenicopterus is no where mentioned by Name by the Philosopher; yet they can hardly believe that he was ignorant of a Bird so clearly described by his Contemporary Aristophanes. Mirum est, says Gesner, hujus tam pulchrae & eximiae Avis nomen ab Aristotele taceri, cum Aristophanes, qui vixit eadem aetate, meminerit. Sed Graecis etiam raram esse hanc avem puto. Bellonius thinks that Aristotle described this Bird under the Name of Glottis or Lingulaca. as Theodorus Gaza translates it. Aldrovandus is of the same Opinion, but Gesner and Scaliger are not; for the first says, Ego vero iis quas Gallinulas aquaticas nostri vocant avibus Glottidem adnumero, quae emnes fissipedes sunt: And the latter in his Commentary upon this Passage says. Glottis autem quae sit nondum mihi constat. Ridiculum quod quidam de Phaenicoptero ausus est pronuntiare. (n) Charlton de Differentiis &et Nom. Animalium. (o) Lister Annot, in Apicium Coelium. Lib. VI. cap. 7. M m m m 2 Victus, (528) Victus Ratio, Nidificatio, Volatus, &c. Gesner says, circa lacus & paludes victitat, and that it seeds on Perwinkles and Fish: And by Dampier's Account we learn, that they delight to keep together in Flocks, and seed in Mud and Ponds, or in such Places where there is not much Water; that they are very shy, and therefore it is hard to shoot them; that they build their Nests in shallow Ponds, where there is much Mud, which they scrape together, making little Hillocks, like small Islands, appearing out of the Water, a Foot and an half from the Bottom: They make the Foundation of these Hillocks broad, bringing them up tapering to the Top, where they leave a small hollow Pit to lay their Eggs in. And when they either lay their Eggs or hatch them, they stand all the while, not on the Hillock, but over it, with their Legs on the Ground in the Water, resting themselves against the Hillock, and covering the hollow Nest upon it with their Wings: For their Legs are very long, and building thus, as they do, upon the Ground, they could neither draw their Legs conveniently into their Nests, nor sit down upon them otherwise than by resting their whole Bodies there, to the Prejudice of their Eggs or Young, were it not for this admirable Contrivance, which they have by natural Instinct. They never lay more than three Eggs, and seldom sewer. The young ones cannot fly till they are almost full grown; but will run prodigiously fast. Thus far Dampier. Du Tertre, in his History of the Isles, &c. gives these further Circumstances. Ces oyseaux, dit il, ont le ton de la voix si fort, qu'il n'y a personne, en les entendant, qui ne creust que ce sont des trompettes qui sonnent. Ils sont toujours en bandes, & pendant qu'ils ont ~ teste cachee, barbodans l' eau comme les Cygnes, pour trouver leur mangeaille, il y a toujours un en sentinelle tout de bout, le col etendu (529) du, l'oeil circonspect, & la teste inquiete. Si tost qu'il appercoit quelqu'un, il sonne la trompette, donne l'alarme au quartier, prend le vol tout le premier, & tous les autres le suivent. Ils volent en ordre comme les Grues; que si l' on les peut surprendre, ils sont si facile a tuer, que les moindres blessures les font demeurer sur la place. Ils sont rares & ne se voyent jamais, si non dans les salines le plus eloignees du Peuple. On les ecorche, & de leur peaux on fait de fourreurs, que l' on dit etre tres utile a ceux qui sont travaillez des froideurs & debilite d' estomac (p) Rochfort likewise informs us, That Ils ont l' Ouye & l' Odorat si subtile, qu'ils eventent de loin les chasseurs, & les armes a feu. Pour eviter aussi tout surprise, ils se posent volontiers en des lieux decouverts, & au milieu de marecages, d'ou ils peuvent appercevoir de loin leurs ennemis; & il' y en a toujours un de la bande qui fait le guet. Ils sont gras & ont la chaire assez delicate. On conserve leur peau qui est convert d'un mol duvet, pour etre employe aux mesmes usages que celles du Cygne & du Vautour. De Laet observes, that these Birds are so accustomed to Salt Water, that the Indians, when they tame them, mix Salt with the fresh Water for them; else they pine away and die. And though Aristophanes says it is ~ ~ ~, or not used to be tame; yet Gassendus writes, that M. Varius, President of the Parliament at Aix in Provence, and a great Friend of M. Peireso, used to divert himself with feeding them with Bread moistned with Water, which they commonly eat in the Night and not in the Day Time. The same learned Person observed, that they could discern the Approach of cold Weather, and would come to the Fire, so as sometimes to burn their Feet; and that when one Foot pained them, they would go upon the other, using their Bill instead (p) Histoire des Antilles. of (530) of the burnt Foot; That they slept standing upright on one Foot, with the other drawn up to their Breast among their Feathers: And lastly, that very little Sleep served their Turn. Usus. This beautiful and scarce Bird was much esteemed by the Romans, and frequently made use of in their costly Sacrifices and sumptuous Entertainments. Thus Suetonius (q) describing the equisite Sacrifices which were appointed by the mad Emperor Caligula to be offered to himself as a Divinity, says of them, Hostiae erant Phaenicopteri, Pavones, Tetraones, Numidicae, Meliagrides, Phasianae, quae generatim per singulos dies immolarentur. And the same Historian relates further (r), that this Emperor pridie quam periret sacrificans respersus est Phaenicopteri sanguine. That the Tongue of this Volatile was much commended, and in great Esteem, for its excellent Taste and most delicious Relish, will appear from the following Quotations. And first we read in Pliny (s), that Apicius said the Tongue of this Bird was a delicious and savory Bit, Phaenicopteri linguam praecipui esse saporis Apicius docuit, nepotum omnium altissimus gurges. The Poet Martial says the same thing in the aforecired Epigram: Dat mihi penna rubens nomen: sed lingua gulosis Nostra sapit; And Juvenal (t) in that Satyr where he exposes the extravagant Luxury and Gluttony of the Romans, men(q) Suetonii Caligula, ~. 22. (r) Scalig. ~. 57. (s) Plinii Nat. Hist. Lib. X. cap. 48. (t) Juvenal. Sat. XI. tions (531) tions this Fowl, amongst some others equally rare, that they made use of in their Feasts. Et Scythicae volucres & Phaenicopterus ingens. We read in Suetonius how the Emperor Vitellius had them often served at his Table, with a great many more Varieties brought from the most distant Parts of the Universe; his Words are, (u) In hac Scarorum jocinera, Phasianorum cerebella, linguas Phaenicopterum, Muraenarum lactes a Carpathio usque fretoque Hispaniae per Navarchos ac Triremes petitarum commiscuit; hoc est, ab extremis imperii sinibus Orientum versus & Occidentem. And Heliogabalus, another of the Roman Emperors, as Lampridius writes, treated his Courtiers with sumptuous nice Dishes made of the Inwards and Brains of Phaenicopters, exhibuit Palatinis ingentes dapes extis & cerebellis Phaenicopterorum refertas. What is related by Gassendus, in the Life of that learned Nobleman Peireskius, is no Argument against the excellent Relish of the Tongue of this Bird. For his Friend Varius, who therein seems to contradict the received Opinion, was at that Time just upon the Recovery from a long illness; he had no Appetite, loathed all Sorts of Meats, and mended but very slowly; so that its no Wonder if he did not perceive all the Relish of that nice Bit, for which of old it was so much commended. Besides, his Answer is not as to the Tongue, which was owned to be much sweeter than that of a Kid, but to the Flesh of this Bird, (as will appear from the Original.) Rogatus subinde fuit de sapore carnis Phaenicopteri. Excepit autem mirari se, cur illam Apicius apud Plinium, & Imperatores Caligula & Vitellius apud Suetonium, Heliogabalus apud Lampridium, & nonnulli alii tantis in deliciis habuissent. Esse enim eam injucundam, aut saporis certe non exquisiti, aquaticarum aliarum instar, cum etiam piscem oleat; unde a (u) Suetonii Vitell. ~. 13. Pro (532) Provincialibus utplurimum abjicitur, exuviaeque solum sunt usui in fastuosis conviviis, carnibus aliarum avium obtegendis. The Way to dress the Phaenicopter, and how to make a Sawce fit for it, we may read in Apicius's Book de Obsoniis & Condimentis, seu de Arte coquinaria, Lib. VI. c. 7. Phaenicopterum elixas, lavas, ornas; includis in cacabum, adjicies aquam, salem & aceti modicum; dimidia coctura alligas fasciculum porri & coriandri ut coquatur: Prope cocturam defrutum mittis, coloras: adjicies in mortarium piper, cuminum, coriandrum, laseris radicem, mentham, rutam: fricabis: suffundis acetum: adjicies caryotam. Jus de suo sibi perfundis, reexinanies in eundem cacabum, amilo obligas, jus perfundis & inferes. Aliter. Assas avem, teres piper, ligusticum, apii semen, sesamum, defrutum, petroselinum, mentham, cepam siccam, caryotam; melle, vino, liquamine, aceto, oleo & defruto temperabis. Philostratus Puniceam Avem, i. e. Phaenicopterum, inter mensarum delicias numerat, Lib. VIII. Vitae Apoll. (x) Wormius. Linguam hujus avis veteribus Romanis in deliciis olim fuisse docent cupediarum magistri Apicius & alii. Dr. Grew. The Tongue of this Bird, as Apicius said, was a delicious Morsel amonst the Romans. N. B. In the Treatise de Obsoniis & Condimentis, that goes under the Name of Apicius, there's no mention made of the Tongue of this Fowl: For as Dr. Lister well observes, Apicius noster hic silet de linguae praecipuo sapore: Which is a pretty convincing Proof, that this Book de re coquinaria, is only a Collection made by some modern Roman; the Name of the old Apicius, that great Master of the Art of Eating, being only prefixed to it, for the Benefit of the Bookseller. (x) Musaeum. Dampier (533) Dampier. The Flesh of both young and old is lean and black, yet very good Meat, tasting neither fishy nor unsavory: A Dish of Flamingo's Tongues being fit for a Prince's Table. They are large, having a large Knob of Fat at the Root, which is an excellent Bit. Du Tertre. La chair en est excellente, quoy qu'elle sent un peu la marine: mais sur tout la langue passe pour le plus friand morceau qui puisse etre mange. Descriptio Partium. Magnitudo. According to Bellonius this Bird is of the Bigness of the Fowl he calls Elorius, which is our ~. Scaliger compares it to the Heron, magnitudo ei Ardeae. Gesner says it is as big as a Ciconia or Stork, or rather bigger. Aldrovandus writes, de magnitudine ejus ego nihil certi ossero, quia Avem ~ vidi. Dampier. The Flamingo is a sort of large Fowl much like the Heron in Shape, but bigger and of a reddish Colour. Du Tertre. ~ Flamand est un oiseau gros comme une Oye sauvage. Collum. It hath an extraordinary long Neck according to Mr. Willoughby. Du Tertre. Il a le cou rouge, fort menu pour la ~ de l' oyseau, & long d'une demy Toise. Cauda. Scaliger. Caudam habet brevissimam ac veluti praecisam. Rostrum & Caput. Scaliger writes, that the Bill of this Fowl is neither streight nor altogether crooked: Rostrum neque rectum N n n n plane (534) plane, sed neque aduncum habet, Scythici arcus partem potius imitatur. Gesner, who compares this Bird to the Crane for Bigness, adds, Rostro sequialtera fere longitudine ad Ciconiae rostrum, superius crasso & tuberculis quibusdam aspero. Aldrovandus commends the Account Scaliger gives of the Bill, and then adds, in Rostri autem conformatione non parum lusit Natura; non enim ut Anatum aut Anserum planum est, cum alioqui sit latum, neque ut Ardearum rectum & rotundum, neque denique ut rapacium Aquilarum aut Accipitrum aduncum; cum tamen sit curvum ~ & ~ inflexum, sed in medio superioris mandibulae notabili ~rantia insigne, sex digitos longum, intus cavum & canaliculatum media sui parte. Superior etiam mandibula ~ longior est, & in acutissimam aciem definit; contra vero inferior longe crassior. Du Tertre. Il a la teste ronde & petite, a laquelle est ~tache un gros bec, long de quatre pouces, moitie rouge & moitie noire, & recourbe en forme de cueilliere. Olaus Wormius gives the following Description of the Head and Bill of the Phaenicopter, which he had sent him from a Friend, viz. Caput longitudine uncias octo superabat. Ipsum caput, excepto rostro, trium erat. Rostrum ipsum figuram a Scaligero delineatam obtinet, in medio crassum satis sed cavum, superiore ejus parte utrinque ad latera caniculatum; ad sui exortum duobus grandibus foramlnibus olfactui deputatis praeditum, in extremitate aduncum, interne denticulatum cum costa seu eminentia in medio. Pars vero inferior nigra, frequentibus praedita striis ad extremum excurrentibus; longitudine vero cedit superiori, sed ampla est et capax, crassae linguae, quae aberat, excipiendae apta. Dr. Grew has obliged us with a very curious Account of the Bill of this Bird, for which he says it is most remark(535) remarkable. The Figure of each Beak is truly Hyperbolical: The upper Jaw is ridged behind, before plain or flat, and pointed like a Sword, with the Extremity bended a little downwards: Within it hath an Angle or sharp Ridge, which runs all along the Middle, at the Top of the Hyperbole, not above a quarter of an Inch high: The lower Beak in the same Place above one Inch high, hollow, and the Margins strangely expanded inward, for the Breadth of above a quarter of an Inch, and somewhat convexly. They are both furnished with black Teeth, as I call them from their Use, of an unusual Figure, scil. slender, numerous, and parallel as in Ivory Combs; but also very short, scarce the eighth Part of an Inch deep. An admirable Invention of Nature, by the Help of which and of the sharp Ridge above-mentioned, this Bird holds his flippery Prey the faster. Mr. Ray describes the Rostrum to be latiusculum, singularis & insolitae figurae; mandibula nempe superior incurva, depressa, dentata; inferior crassior. Menippus, the Cynick Philosopher, in a Fragment of his de Homine (which however at this Time is either lost, or at least hard to be come at) affirms this Bird to move its upper Jaw, as we find him quoted by (y) Rondeletius, where he is talking of the Crocodile's moving that Mandible: His Words are, sed id non soli ex omnibus animalibus Crocodilo peculiare, nam intra Aves, Phaenicopterus superiorem partem Rostri movet, ut annotavit Menippus Philosophus, Libro de Homine. Gesner makes the very same Quotation from Rondeletius. (z) Cardanus repeats the same thing without Mention of any Author, nam quidam existimant etiam Phoeni(y) Rondel. Lib. de Amphibiis, Chap. 5. (z) Carden de Amphibiis Rerum, Lib. 7. Cap. 37. N n n n 2 copteros (536) copteros aves Mandibulam movere superiorem; but subjoins, sed non adeo manifesta causa est in Ave ut in Crocodilo. Wormius is of the same Opinion; but with Cardan, he thinks the Cause is not so manifest as in the Crocodile. Dr. Charleton says, that it was Cardanus that first made that Observation. Dr. Grew argues for this Movement from the peculiar Structure of the Rostrum; alledging, however, that there can be no Determination of these Matters, without Inspection into the Muscles, and the Articulation of the Bones. As for the Phaenicopter, says he, it must needs be said, that the Shape and Bigness of the upper Beak (which here, contrary to what it is in all other Birds that I have seen, is thinner and far less than the neither) speaks it to be the more fit for Motion, or to make the Appulse, and the neither to receive it. Crura & Pedes. Bellonius remarks, that the Legs of this Volatile are very long. And on the contrary, *Scaliger writes, Crura pedesque sunt adeo breves, ut cum in Homine Galenus agnoverit longissimos, huic omnium, quae nota sunt nobis, animalium brevissimos attribuere potuerit. For this he is severely taxed by Dr. Charlton, hic nobis candide not andus occurrit error quidam Scaligeri egregius: Is nimirum in Exercit in Arist. Hist. Animal. (this is wrong quoted, the Place being in Arist. Lib, de Generat. Anim.) peculiares Phaenicopteri notas satis prolixe describens, crura ei brevissima curtosque pedes attribuit, (verbis supra citatis) atque Avem hanc & cruribus & suris gradiri longissimis, omnium quotquot seu vivam seu mortuam contemplati sunt oculi confirmant. Et quis precor, ullam aliam, ex Aquaticarum fissipedum & piscivorarum classe, volucrem unquam conspexit brevibus pedibus in* Scalig. Excerit. 233. ~ 2. de Subtilitate, ad Cardanum. structam? (537) structam? Certe nemo. Neque consentaneum est, ut quas Naturae consilium ad pisces in stagnis & fluviorum vadis, non natando sed grallatoriis veluti gradibus vadando, captandos destinaverit, eis crura concenderentur tam necessario ad victum quaerendum officio imparia. Ad haec, non aliunde fuit quam a proceritate crurum & colli, quod Phaenicopterus clim a Juvenale ingens diceretur. Dr. Grew observes the same Mistake, but in fewer Words, which are the following; when Scaliger therefore saith that this Bird hath the shortest Legs of any Animal yet known, he would have said the longest. Gesner says, it is Cruribus rubris, ea proceritate qua in Ciconia sunt, vel procerioribus. Du Tertre. C'est le plus haut monte de tous les oyseaux que J'ay jamais veu en ma vie. Il a les Jambs tout rouges, & les pleds a demi marin. (y) Rochfort. Ils ont les jambbs & les cuisses si hautes, que le reste de leur corps est eleve de terre de deux bons pieds ou environ. Color Plumarum. Scaliger thus elegantly expresses the fine Colour of its Wings Cinereum colorem nobilitant alarum puniceae pennae. Aldrovandus. Mirum est cur nigrum alarum colorem non annotavit Scaliger. Caetera tota Avis ex cinereo, phaeniceo & albo coloribus mistis spectalur. Gesner says, Pennis albis parte prona; rubentibus per Collum, Pectus, Ventrem & Alas. And speaking of one taken near Montpellier, he says, tota alba, praeter illas in alis partes quae nigrae sunt in Ciconiis (z) De Laet observes, that while they are young their Feathers are chiefly white; but as they grow up, they are painted with an Infinity of Colours. Mais ils disferent en couleur, d' autant qu'il, ont le plamage blanc quand ils (y) Hist. des Antilles Edit. Rottord. p. 583. (z) Hist. du Nouveau Monde, Lib. 1. Cap. 9. & Lib. 18. Cap. 15. sont (538) sont jeunes; puis apres a mesure qu'ils croissent, ils devient de couleur de rose, & en fin quand ils sont agez, il est tout incarnat. Il se trouve de ce memes oiseaux, pres de Montpelier, qui ont seulement le dessous des ailes & du corps incarnat, & le dessus noir. Il s'en voit aussi aux Isles, qui ont les ailes melees de quelques plumes blanches & noires. Du Tertre gives much the same account. Les Jeunes sont beaucoup plus blancs que les vieux, & ils rougissent a mesure qu'ils avancent en age. J'en ay veu aussi quelquesuns qui avoient les ailes meslees de plumes rouges, noires & blanches, & je croy que ce sont les males. (~) Constantinus Rostrum, & crura, & pars alarum, puniceo colore rutilat. Willoughby says, the Neck and Body is white: The Alarum Remiges, or Quill-Feathers of the Wings, are black; but the Vestivrices, or Covert-Feathers, are wholly dyed with a most beautiful, bright purple, or flame Colour, unde ei nomen. Dampier. The young ones at first are of a light grey; and as their Wing-Feathers spring out, they grow darker, and never come to their right Colour, or any beautiful Shape, under ten or eleven Months old. When many of them are standing together by a Pond's Side, being half a Mile distant from a man, they appear to him like a Brick Wall; their Feathers being of the Colour of a new red Brick: And they commonly stand upright and single, one by one exactly in a Row, except when feeding, and close by each other. Color Pedum. All Authors agree in the red Colour of its Legs and Feet. Thus Scaliger, Crura pedesque alis habet concolores. (~) Constant. Lexicon Graece. Latin. Color (539) Color Rostri. Gesner says, Colore rubro instar sanguinis. Aldrovandus writes, Pars quae spectat frontem ex albo ad Castaneae colorem vergit, caetero nigrum. Willoughby asfirms, that the Tip of the Bill is black, or of a dark blue. Figurae. The whole Fowl is delineated by Gesner and Aldrovandus; and Dr. Grew has given us the Figure of the Head and Bill, as he found it amongst the Rarities in Greshum-College. N. B. The Figure of the Phaenicopter in Willoughby, is copyed from the second of Aldrovandus. Gesner says the Phaenicopterus whence his Figure was taken, was sent to him by Rondeletius. Aldrovandus had the first of his Figures from Sardinia; and the second. which he calls Phaenicopterus alter rostro lato, was given him by that famous Botanist Carolus Clusius: He owns that he never saw the Bird himself. In de Rochfort, the Body and Neck of the Flammant is pretty well delineated; but the Legs are not, neither is the Bill, nor the Claws. (*) Du Hamel gives a very exact Account of this Bird in the following Words, with which I'll close this tedious and prolix Description, collected from all the Authors that have made any mention of the Phaenicopter or RedWing. Collo pralongo, cruribus productis, exili pede sed firmo donatur; oculi itidem angusti sunt & rubei; cystis fellea e parte inferiore hepatis est pensilis. Vas ipsum e quo suspenditur, quove bilem excipit, amplum est, contra atque in Homine & in Quadrupedibus observatur; in his (*) Hist. Acad. Royale Edit. Paris, p. 213. enim (540) enim radices vesiculae sunt admodum exiles. Oesophagus in sui initio valde angustus, paulatim latior sactus in ingluviem seu in saccum ampliorem desinit: Ventriculus fere ut in Gallina, tametsi Granis non vescitur, sed parvis Conchyliis, quae ventriculi musculis teruntur ut Grana. This Author tells us that the Phaenicopter was dissected by Monsieur Perrault at Paris. Alae cjus didictae colorem illum rutilum exhibent, unde vulgo Flamand dici solet, non quod in Belgio reperiatur, sed quia ejus Plumae per membranam pellucidam visae colorem flammeum praebent: Vix ulla est Avis major: Rostrum ex utraque parte deorsum incurvatum, quod in ca Ave omnino est singulare; ar atri enim instar inflectitur, unde & vulgo Becharu, quasi Aratrirostrum, appellatur. Haec ille. When I get the Opportunity, which I do very much long for, of dissecting this fine Volatile with my own Hand, I shall then more particularly insist on the Anatomical Part; and, with all the Exactness I can, give a true Description of each Viscus. I proceed to the Explanation of the Figures, which were drawn from a Flamingo that was sent to Mr. Botley to be stufft. The Explanation of the Figures, Tab. II. Fig. ~. Gives a Side-view of the Head and Bill. Fig. II. In this is represented a Front-view of the same Parts. Fig III. Exhibits the under-side of the Tongue next the under Bill. In which a denotes a Cartilaginous Substance that covers the Tip or extremity of the Tongue; b a Glandulous Substance at its Basis; c the Horns of the Os Hyoeides. Fig. IV. In this the upper side of the Tongue is fairly delineated, upon which we see two Rows of strong Papillae Nerveae; their Apices or Points turning inwards, for the better retention of the Prey. Fig. V.

In this the Tongue is drawn in a lateral View. that we may have a Prospect of the true Figure of these Papillae, which being hooked and turn'd backwards prevent, in a great Measure, the return of any little Animal swallowed alive, which they seed upon. Fig. VI. The Cornua or Horns of the Os Hyoidaeum are drawn in this last Figure, as all the other Parts are, as big as the Life.
