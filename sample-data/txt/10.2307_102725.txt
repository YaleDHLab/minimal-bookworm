(1468) V. Part of a Letter from Richard Waller, Esq; S R. S. to Dr. Hans Sloane, R. S. Secr. Concerning two Deaf Persons, who can speak and understand what is said to them by the Motion of the Lips. THERE live now, and have from their Birth in our Town, a Man and his Sister, each about 50 Years Old, neither of which have the least sense of Hearing; they both live by their daily Labour, yet both these Persons know by the motion of the Lips only, whatever is said to them, and will answer pertinently to the Question proposed to them of any thing within their Capacity, and are both very intelligent, as far as can be expected from their Education. I remember several Years since, Mr<inferred>.</inferred> Colson the Mathematical Master, coming to see me, this Man was then working in the Garden; and Mr. Colson and I standing close together, I took an opportunity when the Fellow look'd on me, to ask him some Question or other, which he readily understood, and answer'd according to it; tho Mr. Colson that stood by me heard me say nothing, the Fellow understanding it only by the motion of the Mouth, so that you need only Whisper,provided the Lips and Mouth be but moved as they ought, and you do not speak too fast. I many Years since inquired of his Mother, who has been long since dead, as to their Deafness; and she told me, they could Hear very well and Speak when they were Children, but both lost that Sense afterwards, which makes them retain their Speech: Tho that, to Persons not used to (1469) to them, is a little uncouth and odd, but intelligible enough, especially the Mans. They were not Twins; and I knew three Brothers of the same Parents, that had their Hearing as well as any Persons whatever.
