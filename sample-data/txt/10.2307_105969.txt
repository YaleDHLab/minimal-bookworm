[443] XLIII. Part of a Letter from W. Watson, M. D. F. R. S. to John Huxham, M. D. F. R. S. at Plymouth, giving some Account of the late Cold Weather. Dated London, 14 February, 1767. Dear Sir, T H I S waits upon you to inform you of the degree of cold we have lately experienced. After as mild a winter as has been known here for many years, the frost has been intense. Until the latter end of December, many of the tender annual exotic plants continued alive; such as the African Marygold, Nasturtium Indicum, and others of this class. I saw even the plant, usually called Balm of Gilead, at that time flourishing without shelter. Mr. Miller of Chelsea, with whom I talked upon this subject, informed me, that he had known the like but twice in his life; and that was in the years 1717 and 1722. However, at the beginning of last month, January, after some smart gusts of wind at East, it began to freeze; and continued increasing, until the fifth of that month, in the morning, my thermometer, an excellent one made by Mr. Bird, stood in the open air somewhat under 20~. in the evening it was 29~. It continued thereabouts to the ninth, when in the morning it stood at 20~ again, and at night at 21~. On the tenth in the morning it stood at 17~, at night at 18~. From this time to the eighteenth it was never below 23~, but L l l 2 frequently Read Nov. 19, 1767. [444] frequently above the freezing point. On the eighteenth at night it stood at 19~ and ~. On the nineteenth at six in the morning it stood at 16~, at eight in the morning 15~ 1/2, at eleven at night 17~. On the twentieth at eight in the morning it stood at 18,'' at eleven at night 22~. On the next day, January twenty-first, the frost broke; the thermometer at four in the afternoon standing at 36~. In the country it has been observed much colder. On January tenth, at Cardington in Bedfordshire, Mr. Howard, Fellow of the Royal Society, by two thermometers, observed the mercury, at six in the evening, to stand at 9~. And upon the same day the Rev. Mr. Wollaston, at East Dereham in Norfolk, found it so low as 8~. Mr. Ellinet, at Norwich, on the nineteenth of January, found his thermometer, at eight o'clock in the morning, to stand at 7~; at noon at 22~; at five in the afternoon 18~; at ten at night at 8~. Seven degrees therefore is the lowest point, at which I have heard the thermometer has stood any where in England during the late frost. January tenth was the coldest day at Plymouth, where Dr. Farr, a very ingenious physician, and Mr. Mudge, who has communicated several papers to the Royal Society, each observed his thermometer to stand at 23~ and 1/2. The severe frost of 1739, of which no account appears in the Philosophical Transactions, began December twenty-ninth, when Lord Charles Cavendish's thermometer in his room stood at 25~; the next evening 21~. From this time his Lordship placed his instrument out of the window, and at some distance from it; when 1 in [445] in the evening of December thirtieth, it stood at 17~. On the morning of January fifth, it stood at 13~. On the eighth at 15~. The ninth at 14~. Twentysecond at 19~. Twenty-fifth at 17~. On February fifth at 21~. During all this time, the thermometer was seldom above 32~, the freezing point. Thirteen degrees, therefore, during this frost, was the lowest observation, by Lord Charles Cavendish in Marlborough Street. I am, with all possible respect, Dear Sir, your most obliged, and obedient Servant, W. Watson. Abstract [446] Abstract from a Meterological Diary kept at Plymouth. This contains Observations twice a Day; the Barometer and Thermometer are made by Sisson, the Rain Machines also, and similar to that described in the Edinburgh Medical Essays. N. B. One of the Thermometers is kept in a Parlour where there is no Fire, the other without Doors in the Rain Machine, which is never affected by the Sun, but was not examined before or after the Sun set; so that the lowest State of the Thermometer in these Parts is not ascertained.
