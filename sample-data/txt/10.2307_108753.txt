[ 747 ] XXIX. On the Elimination of Urea and Urinary Water, in, relation to the Period of the -Day, Season, Exertion, Food, Prison Discipline, Weight of Body, and other influences acting in the Cycle of the Year. By EDWARD SMITH, M.D., LLB., F.B.S., Assistant Physician to the Hospitalfor Consumption and -Diseases of the Chest, Brompton, Corresponding Fellow of the Academy of Sciences and Arts of lontpellier, and of the Natural History Society of Montreal, &c. Received April 18,-Read May 30, 1861. I PuRPosE in the following communication to state the results of two series of experiments in reference to urea and urinary water in the healthy human system, with a view chiefly to show their relation to exertion, food, nutrition, period of the day, and season of the year, and to enable me to contrast these relations with those of carbonic acid, which I had the honour to lay before the Royal Society in 1859, and which have been published in the Philosophical Transactions. The first series of inquiries was made upon myself, and was continued from January 18, 1860, to March 18, 1861, and numbered 1633 observations upon the urinary water, and 1073 analyses for urea on 336 days. The observations were fewer in the months of September and October than in the other months; but from January to the end of July 1860, throughout nearly the whole of October, and from the early part of November until the end of the inquiry, the observations were not intermitted. [The inquiries were continued daily until March 18, 1862; so that the whole series comprehends a period of two years and two months, with 635 days of actual daily observation, and nearly 1400 analyses for urea*.] The ordinary food was taken during this period; and each part of it was weighed and recorded, except in some of the summer months. It was of a simple kind, consisting of coffee and bacon for breakfast, at about 9 A.M.; one kind of meat, with vegetables -and pudding, at 2 to 3 P.M.; tea with bread and butter at 6 P.M., and coffee with bread and butter at 9 or 10 P.M. On Tuesdays and Fridays coffee and bread and butter were taken at 1P.M., and dinner, with tea, at 5 to 6 P.M. No kind of alcoholic liquor was ordinarily taken; and whenever any unusual kind or quantity of food was eaten, or the hour of dining was changed, it was duly recorded. The following is an average example of the-dietary used daily :---cookied meat, 3 oz-.; cooked bacon, 2 oz.; butter, I oz.; bread, 14 oz.; pudding, 9 oz. ; potatoes, 7 oz.; sugar, 2 oz.; milk, 6 oz.; coffee, 35 oz.; tea, 15 oz.; water, 10 oz. The general habits were not interfered with. There was a fair amount of activity, both of body and mind, except on Sunday, when the rest was almost perfect. The s The portions of the following paper which are enclosed in brackets have been added since the paper was read MDcccarxI... 5 I 748 DR. SMITH ON THE ELIMINATION amount of exertion was duly estimated. The month of August and part of September were spent at the sea-side, when there was a little increase of food and exertion. The aim in this part of the inquiry was to determine the amount of urea and urinary water eliminated throughout the year, under the ordinary conditions of a uniform and active life, and therefore under those to which the mass of mankind are subjected. The urine wa's passed at three prescribed periods, viz, on going to bed, on rising and again immediately before breakfast, and also at other periods of the day as necessity required. The greatest care was taken'that not the least portion was lost at any time; and during the alvine evacuation a separate vessel was used. It was commonly passed into tall graduated glasses, and the quantity read off to -1 fl. oz., either immediately or on recording the whole quantity emitted to a certain period; but when travelling 1 part of each quantity was reserved, and a. mixture, of the whole was submitted to examination. The record was commonly completed on the following morning, including the quantity, appearance, specific gravity, and temperature of the urine and the, temperature of the air;, and the analyses. for urea, chloride of sodium, and free acid were then made, but sometimes they were deferred to the second, and in winter occasionally to the third day. The quantity in each twenty-four hours was made up to 8 A.M., and. an. addition or subtraction was made when the night urine was passed before or after that hour, according to the rate at which it was then secreted. The weight of the faeces was recorded, with the hours of evacuation; and during a part of the inquiry the weight of the naked body was ascertained, after the emission of urine, night and morning. Certain experiments were made during fasting, as to the influence of water and other ingesta over the excretion of urine and urinary water in the: morning, and the. dates and results of such experiments were recorded. Hence, this. series of inquiries furnishes the amount and kind of ingesta, the quantity of urea and urinary water, and certain other characteristics of the urine, the weight of the fteces and of the body, and the relations of these to each other, and to the cycle, of the day and, year, with the effect of certain special articles of food upon the urine. I am 5 feet 11I inches high, about 190 lbs. weight, in good health, and fleshy, and was forty-one, years of age in the middle of the inquiry. The second series of experiments were made upon four prisoners in Coldbath Fields Prison (by the courtesy of the Board of Visiting Justices, and with the valuable aid of Mr. LAMBERT, one of the officers of the prison), who worked the treadwheel on three days per week, and did light and routine work, on. the. alternate days. They had been some mnont~hs in prison, and were in fair health. Their ages varied from twenty-two to. forty-two years, their weight from 115 to 133 lbs., and their height from, 5 feet 2?L inches to 5 feet 7 inches. They had long been placed upon the full prison dietary,, consisting of. cocoa and bread for breakfast, meat, potatoes, and bread for dinner, and. gruel. and bread for supper, and three of them gained weight a little during the inquiry.. The urine of each prisoner was collectedseparately up to certain prescribed hours, and the weight of the faeces, with the hour of evacuation,. was recorded.. The usual food was allowed throughout the inquiry, with the following variations: OF URE T 749 1. The salt was reduced from the. inei of bout I oz daily to t oz. daily (besides that contained in the bread g ),.. the sixth day. 2. From the tenth to the thirteenth day n.1 s8aJt-was.allowed, except that contained in the bread and gruel. 3. From the thirteenth to the sixteenth cly extr fat was griven. 4. From the sixteenth to the nineteenth dayrtea was given. 5. From the nineteenth to the twenty-second dy -coffee was given 6.. From the twenty-second to the twenty-fifth day alcohol was given. During the whole period the men were under the immediate observation of Mr. LAMBERT, who most carefully noted the prescribed period for the collection of the urine, the weight of the fteces, the weight of the food, the due admixture of the ingredients in the gruel, the weight of the fat and the lean meat, and the weight of the men, and ascertained that all the food was eaten; and as the men entered willingly into the inquiry (for a trifling pecuniary advantage), I feel assured that the most trustworthy results have been obtained. Mr. MANNING most kindly undertook the laborious analyses of the food, urine, and ftces, so far as relates to the nitrogen and the mineral matter; and to him Ii am greatly indebted. An admixture was made of the whole urine passed in the twenty-four hours, and also of the facces, by all the men; and from these two quantities samples were taken for analysis. Five ounces of the fteces were evaporated to dryness in a wat~er-bath, and the nitrogen was determined in one-third of the dry matter, and the ash from 300 grains of the dry matter. This series of experiments has therefore given the amount of urea, chloride of sodium, and urinary water, the weight and the chemical composition of the focces, the nature and amount of the ingesta, and -the total nitrogen and ash in the ingesta and egesta, and the relation of each to the other and to wvell-defined labour and rest. The whole number of analyses of urea was 248, and a similar number represents the inquiries into the chloride of sodium and urinary water. The method of analysis of urea and chloride of sodium was that recommended by LIEBIG. The chloride of sodium was not removed, but its amount was determined and duly allowed for in estimating the urea. Thle measures employed were decimal parts of the fluid ounce, and the quantities recorded are those of fluid ounces. The solution of protonitrate of mercury was made and graduated by myself in one large quantity of 10 gallons, and was continuously used in all the experiments made since April 13, 1860; but I am indebted to Mr. DUGALD CAMPB:ELL for the solution used at an earlier period, and for many other acts of kindness. All the analyses of urea and chloride of sodium were made by myself. The tubes and pipettes employed were rigorously graduated by the balance;> and as every effort was made to proceed in a most uniform and accuratemanner, and the practice has been very extended, I trust that the errors attending so large -an inquiry have been reduced to a mninimum. [In June 1861 another set of this series of inquiries was prosecuted, similar to those already detailed at Coldbath Fields Prison. They weere made conjointly with Mr. W. OR. MILaER, Surgeon to the Wakefield Gaol, and upon the prisoners entrusted to his care. 5 I 2 750 DR. SMITE ONTEE ELIMINATION Mr. MILNER took the general supervision of the prisoners in reference to their dietary, excretions, and weight, whilst Mr. M-AxxKGkindly determined the nitrogen and dry matter in the frces and urine, and I made the analyses -for urea and chloride of sodium. The following is an outline of the inquiry: Four men, of regular habits and in a good Estate of health, were selected. Two were weavers of wide-width cocoa-matting, which is a very laborious occupation, and two were tailors. Their ages were 19, 22, 24, and 28 years. Their height was 641, 66, 661, and 67 inches; and their weight 118 lbs. 11 oz., 125 lbs. 12oz., 146 lbs. 11w oz., and 146 lbs. 151 oz. The girth around the nipples.was 32-1, 34, 3551, and 35{1 inches, giving an average of nearly 34inches. The total averages of age, height, weight, and girth were 231 years, 6641 inches, 134 lbs. 8' oz., and 341 inches. They had been fed upon the highest class of prison dietary; but as that consisted of too much variety of food for our purpose, it was deemed advisable to give them a uniform daily dietary during one week before the experiments began, and it was thenceforward continued without intermission until the inquiry terminated. The food supplied daily was in part fixed and in other part variable in quantity. The fixed quantities were those of meat, oatmeal, and potatoes, and the variable ones those of bread, salt, and water. Milk was given in a fixed quantity, but the amount supplied was not uniform in the two classes of prisoners. The meat consisted of 5 oz. of lean and 1 oz. of fat cooked beef without bone. The supply of oatmeal was 2 oz., and of cooked potatoes 1 lb. daily. 20 oz. of skimmed milk were given to the tailors, and 25 oz. to the weavers. The daily quantity of bread eaten was on the average 24 3 oz. by the tailors, and 3014 oz. by the weavers, or a general total of 27 35 oz. The quantity of chloride of sodium eaten (besides that contained in the bread) was 136 5 grs. daily by the tailors, and 63-5 grs. by the weavers, giving an average of 100 grs. daily. There was considerable variation in the quantity from day to day; for whilst one of the tailors ate an average amount of 199-3 grs., the other tailor ate only 738 grs. The quantity of water drunk, besides that containedin one pint of gruel, was only 23-8 fluid ounces on the average; and this with the milk gave a total daily supply of fluid of 66 3 oz. The weavers drank much more than the tailors; and the total daily quantities in the two classes were 80 5 oz. and 52-1 oz. The solid food was 51P8 oz., and the fluid 66-3 oz., or a total ingestion of 118 oz. daily. The prisoners rose at 6 A.M., and, having passed urine and faces, were immediately weighed. The scales employed were good ones; and the weight was taken to a quarter of an ounce. The prisoners were weighed naked. The weight of faces and urine was ascertained daily up to 6A.M.; and the degree of consistence of the faces was recorded under four heads, viz. scybalous, well formed, formed but soon subsiding, soft and liquid. A fair sample of the bread, oatmeal, potatoes, meat, and milk was sent up to Mr. MANNING from time to time as changes in the supply occurred. A portion of the mixed quan. tities of the faces and urine of each set of prisoners was most carefully taken and sent for analysis daily; but delay in tranlsmission sometimes occurred, so that the analyses were usually made on the third or fourth day after the evacuation. The greatest care was taken to avoid loss by evaporation or otherwise, and to prevent decomposition. The OF ITREA AND URINARY WATER. 751 observations included thirteen days, besides the week of preliminary dietary and preparatory arrangements.] I propose to state the results of these several inquiries in the following order 1. The absolute amount of urea evolved daily (p. 765). 2. The absolute amount of urinary water (p. 769). [Its relation to weight of body, p. 771.] 3. The relations of the daily amount of urea and urinary water (p. 772). [Contrast of daily quantities during two successive years (p. 802.)] 4. The relations of urea and urinary water to the period of the day with ordinary food, during fasting, and with special articles of food (p. 774). 5. The relations of urea, urinary water, and weight of body to the cycle of the week (p. 793). 6. The relations of urea and urinary water to the cycle of the year, with the influence of temperature and atmospheric pressure (p. 796). 7. The influence of the treadwheel and other prison labour over the excretion of urea, chloride of sodium, urinary water, and faces, both with an ordinary diet and with the addition of certain special kinds of food (p. 804). 8. Certain relations of urea, chloride of sodium, and urinary water to food (p. 818). 9. The relation of the excretion of urea to headache and stomach-derangement (p. 823.) 10. The relation of urea to carbonic acid (p. 824). 11. The relation of urea to nutrition (p. 825). The inquiry into the relations of urea is one of extreme complexity; and I premise a scheme of the modifying circumstances which act together and which require consideration. Relations of Urea. 1.

BECQUEREL ascertained it to be 286-1 grs.; PARKES, 371-5 grs.; BbCxER, 444.9 grs.; BisO'HOFF, 541-9 grs.; J. LEImAYN, 5,51-8 grs.; MOSLER, 558-9 grs.; HAMMOND, 67O-6 grs., and GENTIEI, 688-4 grs.; but the average of all the results collected by D.PREgives 1~ r.pr~ day, or 21 grs. per hour, a quantity which singularly corresponds with the amount obtained by mself on the average of all t the months of the year. These inquiries were not only made upon different persons, but upon those living in different climates and at differen~t seasons of the year-; and only a very few of them were of such duration as to afford any stro ng evidence of the very great'variations in the excretion of urea which occur in'all men during lengthened periods. The amount of urea excreted to each lb. of body eiht was ascertained to be 3' grs. by LEHIMANN and VOGEL; and Dr. PARE ascertained, fromr an analysis of the returns of nine men, that it was 3'36 grs. The average quantity of urea evolved daily in my -experiments during the twelve months, from March 18, 1860, to March 1 9, 1861, was 519 grs., being in the proportion.. of 2-73 grs. to each pound avoirdupois of weight of body. The extreme quantities which were recorded are very diverse, viz. -298 grs. .and 748-5 grs.,daily; but the occasions on which any, atpproach to such extreme amounts was observed were vfery fewash is shown in'the following Table. [From March 18, 1861,g 766 DV. SMITH ON THIE ELIMINATION to March 18, 1862, the daily quantity was 480 grs.; so that the average daily quantity on the two years was 500 grs.] TABLE II.---Showing the proportionate number of days on which various quantities of urea were evolved during the years Grains per day. Per cent. of the whole. 200 to 300 038 300 to 400 3-87 400 to 500 46 500 to 600 39 600 to 700 9.1 700 to 800 2.1 Thus the daily emission of urea was between 400 andl 500 grs. in nearly half of the whole period of inquiry, and in only 15 per cent. of the whole were the quantities below 400 and above 600 grs. The average weekly amount of urea was in no instance below 400 grs.-, and in only one instance did it exceed 700 grains per day. The quantity inl this larger average was between 400 and 500 grs. per day in 49 per cent., and between 500 and 600 grs. per day in 38 3 per cent. of the whole number of weeks. The monthly averages varied from 451 to 665 grs.; but mi 47-1 per cent. the quantity wvas -between 400 and 500 grs., and in 38-4 per cent. between 500 and 600 grs. daily. Hence the most frequent amount of urea evolved was between 400 and 500 grs. daily, and the usual range extended from 400 to 600 grs.; but as only a few experiments were made at the period of the year when the daily evolution was commonly over 600 grains, it is probable that the true frequency of the higher rates is somewhat understated. The following Table exhibits the average quantity of the urea, urine, and faeces which were emitted daily, and the amount of the fluid and solid ingesta, on the average of the: weeks and months of the year. The thick line introduced into this and some other Tables implies that the part following has been added since the reading of the paper. 01F U-REA AND URINARY WATER. 7t37 TABLE1IIJ.-.-Showing the daily amounts of the Ingesta and certain Egesta, with the Temperature and Barometric indications, in weekly and monthly averages. ____ ____ __ _ __ ___ ___ W eekly. _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ ___ _ _ Mea ns, Greenwich.

Absolute amount evolved.-.The observers to whose names.1 have referred in reference to urea (p. 765), state the average daily elimination of ur me to be 44 oz., 40 oz., 81 oz., 54 oz., 67 oz., 65 oz., 39-1 oz., and 47 oz., 'in their order; so that there i' much diversity 'n the amount recorded, and also in the relation between the amount of urea and urine in their several inquiries. PROUT recorded the amount as only 35 oz. ; but the average of all the recorded observations collected by Dr., PARKES is 52-1,oz. per" day, which 'is almost identical with that evolvedby myself on the average of the whole -yearTere was very grea div'ersity in the, daily amount ournywaerexrtdb myself, so that the extremes recorded were 2 3'S and 92'-6 7 fluid ounces in, thetwenty four hours. On the" average of the whole year, from March 18,60 to March 1861, the daily quantity was 5 3'1 fluid ounces; hut it exceeded 6 0 -oz. on -the average of two of the months, and fell below.. 40 oz. on -the average of two :other months. [From March 770 PDR. SPITl ON THE ELIMINATION The following Table shows how frequently the decades of ounces of urine were emitted throughout the year.

The larger quantity of 60 to 70 oz. was present in no fewer than one-fifth of the whole, and the extremes of below 30 and above 70 oz. were found in 10 per cent. of the whole. There was a close proximity in time in the emission of the extreme quantities; so that an unusually large quantity immediately succeeded to or was immediately succeeded by a small one, and vice versd, as is illustrated by the following observations: 1860.

[Relation of Urinary Water to Weight of Body. A reference to Plate XXXVI. will show that there is a very marked and an inverse relation between the variations in the quantity of urine evolved and those of the weight of the body on the same day. There is not an exact correspondence between the two, since the weight of the body must be influenced by many other circumstances than that of the loss of urine; but a selection of the instances in which there was a large and sudden variation in the quantity of urine will suffice to prove the close relationship referred to, and shown in the following Table.

Inl every decade of ounces of urine the variation in the amount of urea, in even the same month, extends to from -50 to 200 grains; and this is equally true whether we regard the medium or the extreme quantities. When, however, we make an average of the whole observations in each month and under each decade, we find that they arrange themselves on a general plan. The following Table contains the average of all the observations made during each month, arranged in the order of the ascending decades of ounces of urine.

But. although the lines of urinary water and urea run parallel to each other, there is not a precise correspondence in the daily excretion of these two.. substances, as the following Table shows.'TABLE IX.-Showing the weight of Urea in each fluid. ounce of Urine, arranged in the ascending order of the middle of each decade of -ounces of the latter (Plate XXXII. fig. 4).

SMITH ON TIE ELIMINATION There was thus a progressive decrease in the amount of urea found in each ounce of urine as the quantity of the latter evolved daily increased; but the quantity of urea in the. lowest was proportionately greater than in the higher decades, and the decrease was more rapid in the ascent from the two lowest decades. If the decade between 50 and 60 fluid ounces be accepted as the central point of this variation, it will be observed that the degree of divergence differs greatly at the two extremes, although equidistant; so that it is the greatest in the upper and the least in the lower decades. In reference to the total daily quantity of urea evolved, the difference was an increase of 162 per cent. with the highest, and a decrease of 9 6 per cent. with the lowest decades; but in reference to the quantity of urea in each ounce, the increase with the lowest decade was 100 per cent., whilst the decrease with the highest decade was only 24 per cent. Thus with increase of urinary water there was a greater increase in the urea than there was a decrease of urea with decrease of urinary water, and the least difference in the amount of urea in each ounce of urine. The average proportion of urea and urinary water throughout the year was 9777 grains of the former in each fluid ounce of the latter; and assuming the average specific gravity of the urine to be 1020, the proportion of urea to urinary water was 2-19 per cent. 4. Period of the day. PARKES states that the quantities of the ingredients of the urine are the highest in the afternoon and evening, from the effect of the dinner and the exertion of the day. DRAPER found the quantity of urea to have lessened in the night, but the. urinary water was equal in the day and night. KAUPP found that when there was a large excretion in one period there was a small one in the other; and PARKES noticed a certain oscillation extending to two or three days, KAuPP also ascertained that there was a diminution in the excretion of urine, urea, and chloride of sodium during the night. In none of these inquiries were the hours of the day and night defined, neither were the conditions as to the ingesta and the hours of the meals alike. In stating the results of my own inquiries, I shall arrange them under two heads, viz. with ordinary food, and with fasting or variation from ordinary food. A. With ordinary food. This part of the inquiry has been investigated by several series of experiments. The amount of urea and urinary water evolved per hour was determined thrice a day throughout nearly the whole year, viz. the average excretion of the whole day, the average of the night, and the quantity secreted in the morning, after the night urine had been voided, and before any fluidor solid food had been taken. The two former embraced lengthened periods, whilst the latter extended to from twenty minutes to one hour only. Ihe object in determining the latter quantity was to ascertain if, at the period of the day when the system was the least influenced by food, there was so uniform a production of urea as to constitute a standard with which to compare the quantities produced OF UREA AND URINARY WATER. 7Th at other periods, and to determine the influence of meteorological phenomena over the daily production of this excretion. At that period, moreover, the only disturbing cause in operation was the slight exertion required whilst dressing. This was called the " basis quantity," and corresponds to a similar inquiry recorded in my paper on the evolution of carbonic acid, published in the Philosophical Transactions, 1859. But beyond these three periods of inquiry there was commonly a fourth, viz. that which intervened between the emission of the basis quantity and midday; and further, an analysis of the urine was made at frequent intervals in the afternoon during the months of January, February, and March 1860. Another series of inquiries was expressly instituted to determine the hourly emission with the utmost exactitude; and on three days the urine was passed at every hour, and on two other days at every quarter of an hour during the day. The food was taken at the hours indicated in the earlier part of this paper. I shall noew proceed to describe the result of the first series of inquiries. Relations of Urea. Plate XXXIII. exhibits the hourly quantities of urea and urinary water at the four periods just mentioned, viz., the whole day, the night, the basis quantity, and the period until midday, on each day of the inquiry throughout the year, and the following Table contains the weekly and monthly averages of the daily quantities. 776 3R.

The average of the whole day was greater still, and the highest elimination took place in the morning hours, up to,, or a little beyond midday. On tbe average of thewhole yearly returns combined, the difference in the. amount elinilated at the different periods of the day is sufficiently great.; for if the average. excretion of the whole day be accepted' as the standard, that of the night 'was 24, and' the "basis quantity" was 6'4 per cent. less, whilst the increase to, nidday was' 175 'per 'cent. greater than that standard. The following are the average quantities exreted at these periods Whole day. Night. Basal quantity. To midday. grs ~~grs. grS. grs. Urea .. . . 521 1g'5 20'3 2g5' The relative diminution of the" excretion in the night is greater than this mode' of comparison indicates; for the standard of the day has been lowered by adding the diminished quantity of the night, iin order to obtain the average of the whole day. Nothing, however, would be gained by separating the day from. the night hours, so as to use the rate of excretion in the former" as a standard of comparison with the latter, since no two observers agree as to the hours which constitute the -day and the night respectively. The Table also imperfectly exhibits the amount of excretion before midday, since that part of the investigation was not pursued at the period of the year when the largest elimination of urea was proceeding; but the second series of inquiries remedy this defect.The monthly averages in Table X. vary the order above given in but one instance, when the basis quantity was '2 gr. per hour less than that of the night. There is also an unimportant exception in the weekly averages, in reference to the rate of the night excretion, in which the night exceeded the day excretion by '2 gr. per hour. The former occurred in May, and the latter in December. 778 DR. SMITH ON THE ELIMINATION There are, however, no fewer than seventeen exceptions in reference to the relative position of the basis quantities and the average of the day. In several instances the excess of the basis quantity was very small, but during the occurrence of the frost in December the basis exceeded the day average, on four out of five weeks, by 4-6, 3 7, 2-1, and 7-6 grs. per hour. In five weekly averages the basal rate fell below the night rate. Plate XXXIII. shows that, in reference to the relative position of the night rate of excretion, on only thirteen occasions throughout the whole year did it exceed the day rate, and then only to the small extent stated in the following Table: TABLE XI.-Showing the exceptional instances in which the night rate exceeded the day rate of excretion of urea, and the amount in excess. 1860.

The same kind of explanation is also applicable to the exception on April 12; but in several other instances, as on December 4 and 8, the exception was due to an unusually low day rate of excretion of urea and urine. In a future part of this paper I shall consider more fully the influence of food in varying the day and night rate of elimination of urea. The investigation of the true value of the basis quantities is beset with much difficulty; for whilst on a large average they are less than the day rate and greater than the night rate, there are not fewer than seventy-two exceptions to the former and twenty-four to the latter law; and whilst many of them are insignificant, there are others in which the variation is very considerable. I think it of great physiological importance to determine if these quantities will at all represent the average of the day, or be any fixed standard with which to compare other returns of a varying nature and with a view to the more complete investigation of this period, I have abstracted and tabulated these exceptions, and have placed by their side the actual quantities of urine emitted on the same and on the previous day. It is very probable that, if any relation exists between the urea in the basis quantity and the total quantity of urine of the day, it will have reference to the day preceding the "; basis quantity."

Thus there is a connexion established between unusually large excretion of urinary water and unusually high basis quantity of urea emitted on the following morning, and this corresponds with observations -recorded when making the 5 N2 782 DIR. SMITH ON THE ELIMINATION analyses throughout the year. It should also be noticed, in reference to the amount of urine emitted on the same day, that whilst on the average it was scarcely higher than the average of the year, the list comprehends twenty-one occasions on which the quantity exceeded 60 ounces. On turning to the exceptions in the relation of the basis quantity of urea with the night urine, it is seen that the defect in the quantity of urine emitted, both on the preceding and on the same day on which the defect in the basal quantity of urea occurred, is quite as marked as is the excess of urine in relation to excess of the basal quantity of urea; for the average was below that of the whole year, and the list comprehends a large proportion of the days of unusually small emission of urine. Hence it is shown that, although the " basis quantity" of urea is on the whole average greater than the night and less than the day quantities, it has a marked tendency to become in excess whenever the quantity of urine is increased, and to be in defect when the quantity of urine is diminished. After a laborious analysis of the returns, and a careful consideration of the subject, I fear that there is not any period of the day at which a standard excretion of urea may be established for short periods, and that the determination of this basis quantity will aid but little as a measure of the vital actions proceeding in the body. The monthly and weekly averages of the rate of excretion of urea before midday, with but one exception, conformed to the rule established by the yearly average. The excess in this quantity over the daily average varied in different weeks from 0 to 8-6 grs. per hour. In the instance which forms the exception, this morning rate was equal to that of the whole day, and was caused by a reduction of the rate on one day from an attack of diarrhoea, which occurred in the morning hours.There were also three exceptions in the weekly averages; but two of these involved only the second place in decimals, and the last was deficient to the extent of 2 grs. per hour. With all these exceptional conditions, there was associated a remarkable diminution in the quantity of urine voided during the morning hours. The relative position of the excretion of urea in the morning hours, in reference to the other periods now referred to, is thus well established. I determined the rate of the excretion of urea during the afternoon at intervals of two or three hours in the month of February 1860, and have stated the results in a few cases in Table XVI. There are variations on the different days; but they do not affect the general direction of the curves, so that all agree in showing that there is a large and rapid increase in the elimination of urea in the morning hours, followed by a gradual decline as the afternoon advances. The hour of maximum elimination was commonly from midday to 2 P.M.; but sometimes it was so early as 10 AM., and so late as 4 P.M. There was frequently seen an attempt at increase in the middle of the afternoon, and this will be further elucidated when we describe the results of the next series of inquiries; but in the instance of February 17 this tendency was so exaggerated as to cause the maximum elimination to occur at that period, a circumstance which was due OF UIREA A.ND URINARY WATER. 783 to the ingestion of an unusually small quantity of fluid at the breakfast, and to my having taken 18 oz. of strong beef-tea without solid food at l" P.M. The first cause lessened the morning excretion, whilst the second increased the emission at the hours indicated; and on both of these grounds, and from my being unwell in the afternoon, the day was exceptional. I now proceed to describe the results of the observations made at each hour of the day, and at every quarter of an hour during limited periods. Most observers have found that the emission of urinary water is increased nearly one-third in the second or third hours after a meal; but others, as CHAMBERT, found no increase, and BENEYE met with great diversity in his results. All persons have, however, noticed an increase in the elimination of urea after a meal; but there is a diversity of statement as to the commencement and the duration of the increase. LEIIMANN and others found it to commence during the first hour, and to attain its maximum in the third hour; but VOIT, in his experiments upon dogs, sometimes observed the maximum so late as the seventh, and traces of the increase remained throughout nearly a whole day. On March 1 and 2, 1861, I made hourly observations from 8 or 9 A.M. until. midnight. The only variation from the ordinary food was, that the dinner on March 2 was unusually large, and black pudding and coffee were taken so late as 10P.M. The following Table contains the results of the inquiries (Plate XXXIV. fig. 1). TABLE XIII.-Showing the Hourly Excretion of Urea and Urinary Water, and the periods of Meals. A.M.

I did not venture to pass urine so frequently as each quarter of an hour throughout the whole day without intermission, on account of the influence which I believe it to have of increasing the secretion of urine and of causing an unusual state of excitement at the neck of the bladder. Breakfast was taken on the first day from p.20 to 9.37 A.M., and dinner commenced at 1.52 P.M.; whilst on the second day coffee, with bread and butter, was taken from 1.20 to 1.30 P.M. The following Table exhibits the results of these inquiries. 784 DR.

The hourly inquiries show that there was a rapid increase of from 10 grs. to 30 grs. per hour in the elimination of urea during the morning hours, followed by a diminution to 15 or 17 grs. per hour at the middle hours of the day. There was a second elevation to 25 and 29 grs. per hour in the afternoon with its maximum at 9 or 10 P.M.; and after that period the final fall occurred, which reduced the rate to the lowest amount of the twenty-four hours. The former was the greater and the more enduring elevation. The smallest emission during the day occurred after the early dinner hour, and the second elevation followed the tea meal. On March 2, when the greatest evening elevation occurred, there was an unusually large ingestion of food, viz. 403oz. of solid food (including 9 oz. of meat and bacon), and 68 oz. of fluid, and there was a sense of oppression or of excess in the evening. On comparison of these observations with those made at longer intervals, there appears some disagreement, since the latter (Table XVI.) did not usually show any very distinct evening increase; but it may be stated in explanation, that the longer interval between the inquiries prevented the discovery of the full fall after midday, and by taking the average of a part of the morning increase with a part of the subsequent fall, and again an average of a part of the fall with a part of the subsequent increase, the effect of both seemed to be nearly lost. The more frequent inquiry at each quarter of an hour, shows yet more clearly the rapid changes which occur during the morning hours. Table XIV. shows that a maximum rate of nearly 55 grs. of urea per hour occurred in 31hours after the breakfast, and was followed by a decline to less than half that amount in the following quarter of an hour. The second part of this inquiry shows the comparatively low and uniform ate of emission after the midday hours, and also the commencement of the evening elevation. Hence it is proved that when meals are taken at the hours adopted by the mass of tne people, there is a rapid and maximum excretion of urea in the hours following the breakfast, with a subsidence at about the early dinner hour. There is no increase immediately following the dinner, but after the tea meal and -in the early evening hours there is a second increase, which is finally lost in the night hours. OF UREA AND URINARY WATER. 78 Relations of Urinary Water. Table XVI. shows that the relations of urinary water to period of the day are very similar -to those now described in reference to urea. The average rate at all hours combined was 2 21 fluid ounces, whilst that of the night was reduced to 1P19, and the basis quantity to 2905, but the quantity evolved to midday was increased to 441 fluid ounces. The decrease in the night and at the hour of the basis quantity, as compared to the whole day rate, was 46 and 7 2 per cent., and the increase at midday was 100 per cent. The night rate varied in the different months from '93 to 1 59 fluid ounce per hour ; but its position in reference to the rates at the other periods of the day was uniformly maintained in every month, and also in every week, during the year, except on two occasions (May and June), when it was equal to the basis quantity. Plate XXXIII. shows that in only six instances throughout the year did the night rate equal or exceed the whole day rate; and the increase was only to the following amount: May 20. May 31. June 21. December 6. December 30. February 23. *1 fi oz. *43 fi. oz. -43 fl. oz. '26 fl. oz. .07 fl. oz. '18 f1. oz. There were, however, seventeen instances, as is shown in the following Table, in which the relative positions of the night and basis rate were reversed, and the former exceeded the latter. TABLE XV .-Showing the exceptional instances in which the night rate of elimination of urinary water exceeded the "basis quantity," and the amount of increase.

Hence it is established that the night rate of the emission of urinary water is less than the whole dayrate, and than the "; basis quantity." The "basis quantity" exceeded the whole day rate in two months, viz. June and March, tothe extent of '25 andd '12 fluid ounces; and in the various weeks the exceptions to the rule were so numerous as 41 per cent. of the whole, and varied from 0 to '8 fluid ounce. There were sixty-two exceptions in the various days of the year, varying fromn 786 DR. SMITH ON THiE ELIMINATION an increase of 0 to 2 45 fluid ounces over the whole day rate of the same day. Of these, forty-seven were the days on which the basis quantity of urea also exceeded the whole day rate, as is observed in Table XII. Many of the exceptions were quite insigni ficant, so that in ten instances the excess only involved the second place of decimals; but in ten others it exceeded 1 oz. per hour. The large number of instances in which the basis quantity, both of urea and urinary water, was excessive, proves the relationship which exists between them, and their mutual dependence upon a common cause; but in 34 per cent. of the days on which the basis quantity of urea was exceptional, there was no exception in the rate of excretion of urinary water at the same period. Hence the estimate already given of the value of the basis determination of urea is nearly equally applicable to the excretion of urinary water. Both vary greatly, and chiefly in relation to the amount of urinary water evolved on the preceding day. The relative position of the rate of urinary excretion before midday was unbroken in every month and week of the year. On three days in the year the rate was less than the whole day rate by the second place in decimals only. There were two exceptions only in reference to the basis quantity, viz, a defect of *15 and *57 fluid ounce in May and June. The rate of excretion varied greatly, and on one occasion exceeded an average of 13 fluid ounces per hour. Table XVI. exhibits the variations of the hourly rate in the excretion of urine during the hours of the afternoon. All the figures show that there was a progressive increase in the quantity through the morning hours, and until two to six o'clock in the evening, and afterwards a progressive decrease until the night period. There were, however, variations in the quantity which are deserving of notice. TABLE XVI.-Showing the Hourly Rate of Excretion of Urine at various periods of the day, in fluid ounces. 1860. AM. P.

February 17 was an exceptional day, since I was not wvell, and beef-tea only was taken at dinner. On the OF UREA AND URINARY WATER. 787 occasions on which the midnight rate was great, fluid food was taken between 10 and 11 o'clock, the two former with wine, at evening parties, and the latter with coffee only. On referring to the hourly excretion of urine, as shown in Table XIII. (Plate XXXIV.), we find that the rate increased after the breakfast until 1 A.M., when a maximum of eleven times the basis quantity was emitted. It then fell, and remained low until 8 P.M., when it rose to a second maximum at 9 or 10 o'clock, and thenceforward fell to the night rate. The morning maximum was nearly four times as great as the evening one. The morning emission did not increase in equal proportions during, each hour until the maximum was attained, but, after slowly rising, it suddenly ascended to the maximum in one hour, and as suddenly fell at the next hour. I had frequently noticed this occurrence throughout the year; and it was usually found in about four hours after the breakfast meal. On March 2, 1861, there were two maxima in the morning, separated by a decrease at 12 o'clock, the former being at the rate of 7-5, and the latter of 11-1 fluid ounces per hour. There was a general correspondence between the rate of emission of urea and urine, but not such a one that the proportionate rate of the two remained the same at each hour, as is shown in the following Table.

The contrast between the quantity of urea eliminated per hour, and the quantity contained in each ounce of urine at the various hours of the day, is delineated in Plate XXXIV. fig. 1, and proves that the proportion is the least in the morning hours, advances with the afternoon, and attains its maximum in the night hours. Table XIV. shows that, during the investigation made at every quarter of an hour, the quantity of urine increased from 7.7 fluid ounces per hour at 102 A.M. to 135 fluid ounces per hour at 12! P.M., and was the greatest at the two periods when the rate of excretion of urea was.. the greatest, viz. 12A, when 54-6 grs. of urea and 13-5 fluid ounces of water were excreted per hour. There was an increase of urine with the increase of urea per hour, but it was not proportionate to the quantity of urea. In the afternoon the rate slowly fell from 4.4 to 3 fluid ounces per hour at 2-3 and 3 P.M., and then rose to 5,4 ounces at the termination of the inquiry. MVcccLxr. 5o? 788 DR. SMITH ON THE ELIMINATION, B. With variations in the ordinary dietary.. Pasting.-MDAosLER, B-ECHER, IBbCKER, FALO:i, and FERBER found that when water was administered during fasting for short periods, the evolution of urea and urinary water was considerably increased, but afterwards the former fell below the normal amount.. The increase in the elimination of water occurred in the second or third hour, and theF increase in the -quantity of urinary water was greater than the increase in the quantity of water supplied. In October 1860 I fasted during 29-1 hours from supper-time, and took 30 ounces of Water only at about the ordinary meal hours, viz. 8 1 A.M., 121512) and 9 p.m. and deter-mined the hourly excretion of urea and urinary water during the day. The results are. given in the following Table, and delineated in Plate XXXIV. fig. 3. TABLE XVIII.-Showing the Hourly Rate of Elimination of Urea and Urinary Water during fasting, but with water.

After the last meal, the night rate of emission of urea was less than 8 grs. per hour; but after taking ten ounces of water it rapidly increased to 34'5 grs. per hour, and subsequently rose after every administration of water, and fell before the period arrived for the subsequent supply. The lowest rate of the day occurred at 5 P.M. and the two highest followed the breakfast and the tea hours. It is singular to notice that there was very little increase following the administration of water at the dinner-hour; and in this respect also it corresponds with the amount evolved after an ordinary dinner. The urinary water was also largely increased after every dose of water, so that the maximum rate was fourteen times greater than the basis quantity; and a decrease always preceded the following supply. Hence the simple administration of water at different periods of the day causes a series of defined curves of increase and decrease of the urinary secretion and of urea. The average hourly rate of elimination of urea from 8-1 A.M. until 212 A.M. without any food having been taken was 15'1 grs. Wate'r only.-On various occasions I drank water or other fluids in the morning, and abstained from food -until midday, with a view to determine their influence at the period of the day when the urinary secretion is the most abundant. The following Tnable and Plate XXXIV. fig. 6 contains the results of drinking ten OF VIEAp AMD TRI IARY WATET. 789 ounces of water at 81, 91, and 11 A.M. the effect being determined every quarter of an hour until midday.

The maximum rate after the first and second dose was upwards of 35 'grs.,, and after the third dose it was 32 grs. per hour. The urinary' water 'increased from the basal rate of 2 8 oz. per hour to the rate of 21G6 oz. per hour in one hour ; and although it fell at the period of observation following the'second dose of water, it was renewed, and increased to the maximum rate of 22-2 oz. in half an hour after the second ;dose. ,It again fell, and subsequently rose after the third dose of water, but, the rate was not then. so high as at the, previous maximum periods.'The period of maximum emission -of waterwas a quarter of an hour later than, that of urea, except after the third dose, when both coincided. The maximum emission was eight times the basis quantity. Vl'arious flids onlg.-Numerous other experiments were made of a similar character but with different fluids, and the examinations were made hourly.

The greatest 'increase always occurred when water was the fluid employed. in these experiments with water the increase 'in the rate of elimination of urea exceeded 100 per cent., whilst in two others with water it was 65 and 76 per cent., and in one was so low as, 35 per cent. Th e effect of tea and coffee was precisely the same, and but little more than half that of water, whilst with black dose there was still an 'increase of 75 per cent. The addition of a little common bread and of gluten bread did not lessen the effect of the water, "but it deferred the period of maximum elimination to the end of the inquiry; and in this respect these experiments stand alone. The largest elimination of urea follwed the se of th gluten bread.MThe maiu efc ofP coffee is stated 'In OF UREA AND URINARY WATER. 791 the Table to be almost immediate; and hence it is possible that it might be due to some unexplained agency, and the subsequent emission should be regarded as the maximum. The effect upon the urinary water was not precisely parallel to that upon urea; but in the instances in which water caused the largest emission of urea it also caused the largest emission of urinary water. The greatest increase, viz. 760 per cent., occurred in an experiment with water; but in that experiment the basis quantity was unusually high, and the increase in the rate of elimination of urea was proportionately small. The least increase occurred with coffee'and black dose; and tea caused a greater increase of urinary water than coffee, although they eliminated urea at precisely the same rate. All these experiments agree with the foregoing in demonstrating the great activity of the urinary function in the morning hours. On several occasions I drank 1-1 oz. of alcohol with 4-1 oz. of water between 8 and 9 A.M., and deferred the breakfast for two hours. The effect in different experiments was to cause within 1hour the following increase in the elimination of urea and urinary water.

In one instance, in which the increase was small, the absolute quantity and the basis quantity were' both high, whilst in another experiment the absolute quantity was low. The uniform effect upon the rate of elimination of water is most striking; for, if we except the first experiment, the increase was almost uniformly 550 per cent. This is too remarkable and too often repeated to be merely a coincidence, and it is probable that it may represent the true effect of alcohol when tak.en in the morning and alone, as above indicated. Bread andfluids.-Another series of experiments demonstrate the effect of a diet of only bread and water and tea and coffee over the hourly'elimination of urea and urinary water. They were made on consecutive days in February 1860, and comprehend one day on bread and wtater, one on bread and tea, one on bread and coffee, and a fourth 79`2 DR.

I attended to my ordinary duties during this inquiry. There was a marked sense of want experienced, and particularly on the first day; but the two following circumstances were the most intolerable, viz. the sensation of cold followin-gthe driniking of the cold water, and the absence of sufficient saliva to enable me tomasticate the bread without taking water with every mouthful. The first was partially relieved by taking a small quantity of bread atnight, the second by drinking warm water; but as the quantity of water was insufficient to enable me to well masticate the bread, I found no relief for the third. The experiment was relinquished on the fourth day, from the sense of depression and the want of courage in looking to the prospective periods of the inquiry; and after its relinquishment I ate heartily and with enjoyment. On the three first days the hourly progression in the rate of elimination of urea and urine was precisely the same as that which occurs with ordinary food; but the maximum was perhaps depressed a little, on account of the small quantity of fluid which was taken at the breakfast. The maximum hourly increase of urea was 14'S grs., 14-3 grs., and 11'9 grs. in their order; and when compared with the basis quantity, the increase per cent. was 100, 141, and 88 in their order. The first day succeededto the Sunday, when there was commonly a small excess of food, and the progress through the day was -so regular that the rate of excretion during the night was the same as it had been in the early morning. Onl the' dayswith tea and coffee added to the; dietary, the maximum amount OF , MTEE AAND RINARAY WATER. R.3 of urea was not so high as it had been on the previous day, but the excretion was very large relatively at midnight on both days. On the fourth day, before additional food was given, the maximum was equal to that on the preceding day, and occurred so early as 11 A.M.; but after the additional food the elimination of urea again increased, and the maximum of the whole day occurred between 7 and 12 P.M. On this day the maximum increase with the bread and water was 10:1 grs. per hour, or 75 per cent. of the basis quantity -'but after the additional food and late in the evening it rose to 16 grs. per hour and 117 per cent., of the basis quantity. It is to be remarked that, after three days insufficient dietary and the addition of abundant food in the afternoon of the fourth day, the rate of elimination on the following night was scarcely, if -at all, increased-a circumstance due doubtless to the fixation of the nitrogen. The rate of the elimination of urine on the first day followed the usual course in health, and attained a maximum of 6 '82 oz. per hour. On the second and third day the rate sensibly declined, and on the day with coffee it w as relatively high in the evening. On the fourth day, before additional food had been taken, the rate was the least which had occurred, and was -so low at midday as 1 8 oz. per hour. Hence this series of experiments showed that a full dietary of bread and water, or tea or coffee', does -not vary the hourly progression of the urinary secretion from that whichis found with mixed food, but it fails to yield comfort to the system, and also that with 48 oz. of fluid per day the rate of urinary secretion fell considerably below that whichordinarily occurs. When mater 'is given with bread alone it should be of the temperature of the body. 5. Cycle of the Week. There are no experiments on record in reference to this subject. Sunday was a day of strong contrast with other days of the week; for I took almost perfect rest on that day, and also ate a little additional solidfood, as follows: 186O. 1861. March. April. May.

As compared with the average returns of all the days of the year, -the excretion of urea was on Sundays 533 4 grs. against 51 9 grs. on all days combined; butas many influential causes of variation occurred during each week which did not occur on Sundays, a more just comparison may be made with the average of those days on which no known cause of variation occurred. I have collected all the unexceptional days and have taken the average of them in each month, as is shown in the following Table:. 794 DR.

The increase chiefly occurred before January 1861; and during the winter months of 1861 there was but little variation on Sundays and other days. The causes of exceptional conditions were very few in January, February, and March 1861; and nearly all the days in those months have been included in the selection. The largest daily emissions of urea which occurred during the year fell relatively more frequently on Sundays than on the whole year, to the following extent Daily excretion, 700 to 800 grs. 600 to 700 grs. 500 to 600 grs. 3-4 per cent. 13-1 per cent. Equal. I have sought to ascertain if this periodical day of increase, or the causes which occasioned it, were influential in any defined order in the other days of the week; and the following Table shows that there is a progressive decline in the rate of emission of urea as the week advances to the. Saturday, on the average of the 191 selected days and the Sundays just referred to. Table XXIII., and Plate XXXII. fig. 7, show the average amount of urea excreted on each day in the week, and on the average of the year; the daily excretion was as follows to the end of December 186(0:Sunday. Monday. Tuesday. Wednesday. Thursday. Friday. Saturdav. Urea, gre.... 574 491 488 485 476 460 475 The loss from the Monday to the Saturday was 31 grs., and it was greater proportionately on the Thursday and Friday than on the earlier days in the week. There was an increase on the Saturday; and, in explanation, I may state that Friday is my last Hospital day, when I take only coffee and bread and butter for lunch, and dine at a later hour, and on Saturday I have commonly more rest than on other working days. OF UREA AND URINARY WATER. 795 Hence during a week of regular labour and food, the daily rate of excretion of urea diminishes as the week advances. I have also found that, on the average, the weight of the body increases greatly on the Sunday, and progressively lessens throughout the week, with greater or less uniformity, when a tolerably uniform amount of exertion is made; but with the ordinary variations of exertion the 'weight is the least on the Saturday, and the greatest on the Sunday and Monday mornings. The body was weighed naked on retiring to rest, and also on rising, directly after having passed urine, and before defecation. The hour of weighing was not fixed, but varied at night from 11 on Sundays to 12 or 1 o'clock on other days, and from 8 to 91 in the morning; and therefore there would be cause for a slight variation in the results. The scales were good ones, of ordinary construction; and I did not attempt to weigh nearer than to half an ounce. The average of the weights at night and on the following morning were entered as the weight for that day. The following Table XXIV., and Plate XXXIV. fig. 4, represent the weight on each day from February 4 to March 3, 1861.

There was considerable variation in the progression from day to day in the different weeks; but there was much uniformity in the general fact of a decrease 'in weight towards the end of the week, and the increase at the beginning of the week was without exception. During the first week I made considerable physical exertion daily, but in the others the amount varied; and the average weight of the body increased weeldy, as follows: 8 lbs. 4 oz., 9 lbs. 3Toz., and 10 lbs. 5 oz. + 13 stones. The difference in the average weights on the two first and the two last days of the week was 1 lb. 54oz. in favour of the former; but that in the extremes of single observations was 2 lbs. 31 oz. There was not a very marked variation in the fluid and solid ingesta during the week, except so far as related to the Sunday; but the following Table offers some points of interest.

When, however, the fluid and solid ingesta are added together, there is more variation, and the two lowest amounts occurred on my two Hospital days, when there was a lunch of coffee and bread and butter, instead of an early dinner, and dinner was eaten at a later hour, and then there was an increase on the following day. The combined quantities of the fluid and solid ingesta on the different days were as follows, in ounces: Sunday. Monday.' Tuesday. Wednesday. Thursday. Friday. Saturday. 92'89' 9 5 90 891 921 6. Cyicle of the Year. There are not -any recorded observations upon the influence of season over the urinary excretion except those of VOGEL, who found that the urinary water was increased in the cold season. OF IUREA AND URINARY WATER. 797 by adopting a standard dietary for the whole period, for then the effect of season upon the requirement for food could not be determined; and hence the only practicable inquiry was to allow such food as the system required, and ascertain the absolute amount of urinary excretion during the whole period. The year 1860 was remarkable for the coldness of its summer, and for the longcontinued frost during the winter, so that scarcely any opportunities were afforded of determining the effect of great heat over the. elimination of the urinary secretion. The general effect of season was, however, well established by the results which were obtained, and it was shown that the urinary products increased in quantity as the summer advanced, and decreased in the winter season. Urea. Table III. shows that on the monthly averages the daily quantity of urea progressively increased from 462 grs. in March, through 489, 546, 541, and 505, to the maximum of 646 and 665 grs. per day in August and September, and thenceforward fell through 518, 455, 4516, 475, and 515 to 417 grs. in the last month of the inquiry. The progression in the rate of increase was well sustained through the spring and summer months, whilst the fall was rapid in autumn; and the rate continued much below the average of the year throughout the winter. The months of distinct increase were April, May, June, and July; the maximum months were August and September; the month of decrease was October, and the stationary minimum months were all those at the end of autumn and during the winter. [The monthly averages in 1861 and 1862 differed somewhat from the above in actual quantities, but followed almost precisely the same course. Those recorded in September were much lower than those of the corresponding month of 1860, because I was not then staying at the sea-side.] Thus the year may be conveniently divided into twoseasons, one extending from May to October inclusive, and the other from November to April inclusive,-the former being the season of heat and of maximum production of urea, and the latter of cold and the minimum production of urea. The average elimination of urea in the former period was 570-1 grs., and in the latter 480 5 grs. daily [in 1861 and 1862 the quantities were 530 grs. and 460 grs.], a difference so marked as to show a natural division of the year into the two seasons. In this arrangement the month of April would be that of a change towards increase, and October that towards decrease. The increase from the daily rate of elimination in March to the maximum quantity was 36 per cent. of the former, and the decrease from the maxi mum to the rate iin ;the following March was 29 per cent. of the maximum, whilst the extreme difference beween the minimum and maximum quantities on the monthly average was 46-1 per cent. of the former. Urinary water. The rate of excretion of urinary water followed the course just described in reference ;to urea, viz, increasing with the summer and decreasing in the winter,but with less 5 P2 798 DR. SMITH ON TIE ELIMINATION uniformity than was found in reference to the urea. The quantity eliminated in March 1860 was 51-16 oz. daily, and this progressed through 54-42, 45 53, 53703, 55 3, and 60-1 to the maximum of 64-6 oz. daily in September, and then fell through 56, 51-7, 50-17 to 47'87 in January, and rose to 52-9 and 53'8 in February and March 1861. The progression was thus broken by the diminished rate in May and January, and the increase began so early as February; but the maximum quantities were found at the period of maximum elimination of urea. On dividing the year into two parts, as above indicated, when speaking of urea, we find that the elimination of urinary water was 55 7 oz. daily in the warm, and 519 oz. daily in the cold season. The excess of the maximum over the minimum monthly rate was 40-2 per cent. of the latter. [In 1861 and 1862 the maximum quantity of 57 oz. occurred in the month of September, and in the months of June, July, and August the quantities were less than those recorded in 1860. On the division of the year into two parts the quantity was precisely equal in each, viz. 49 3 fluid ounces.] Causes of Seasonal variation. lTemperature.-KAUPP, in numerous experiments made at various temperatures, found that the quantity of urinary water, urea, chloride of sodium, and, indeed, both solids and liquids diminished as the temperature increased, and he attributed the diminution of the solid excretions to the lessening of the urinary water. LEHMANN found that moderate cold increased, but great cold decreased the urinary excretion. I have not made any experiments with artificial temperatures, or for short periods, or with any regulated or standard dietary to be used under varying conditions, but have ascertained the effect of seasonal variations of temperature with the ordinary variations of food. I was not able to determine the amount of food taken in August and September; but, being then at the sea-side, it is more than probable that it was increased. Hence it is highly probable that the observations hitherto recorded and those now to be mentioned have not been made under parallel conditions; and the results may be due to different causes, although associated with temperature. It is also necessary to bear in mind that the mean external temperature very imperfectly represents the true temperature in which we live during the greater part of the twenty-four hours, and particularly in the winter, and also that other causes exert influences which may correspond with or be opposed to those of temperature. Hence the inquiry is a most difficult one. The general influence of temperature is evident from the foregoing statement; for the lines of temperature and urea were parallel throughout the year. The average temperatures of the two periods of the year were 550 and 440, corresponding with 570 grs. <and 480 grs. of urea daily, which gives the very uniform proportion of 10-36 grs. and 10-9 grs. of urea to each degree of temperature on the average of the two opposite seasons. Moreover, the month (May-) of marked increase in the urea (56-5 grs.) was that of marked increase of temperature (10?r9); whilst that (November) of marked decrease (63 grs.) was also that of great decrease of temperature (9? 65).' As the proOF UREA AND URINARY WATER. 799 duction of urea is due to many causes, we may not expect to find precise uniformity in its relations to temperature; and hence we find that, after the temperature had attained its maximum, the urea continued to increase for a short period; but when the proportionate amount of urea to temperature is tested in the two highest and two lowest months respectively, it is found to be almost absolutely the same, viz. 11-5 grs. and 11 8 grs. to each degree. The foregoing refers to the production of urea, since it comprehends lengthened periods; and the influence of temperature is very clear; but on considering the influence of that agent during short intervals, as in sudden changes of temperature, the acts of production and elimination are mixed together and cannot be easily separated. Hence the effect of the changes of temperature seems to vary at different periods; and this occurs, doubtless, because in some instances the urea is retained longer than in others. I have sought to ascertain the effect of sudden changes, and have found greatdiversity; but commonly the influence was felt on the urinary water on the first, and on the urea on the second day. The following are instances of rapid changes of temperature associated with the effect upon the urinary secretion (Plate XXXII. fig. 6): TABLE XXVI. 1860, November 15. 16. 17. 18. 19. 20. 21. 22. 23.

The following illustration shows a deviation from the rule, in consequence of a very large emission of urine on the day of a frost, compensating the greatly diminished quantity of the preceding day. The urea varied with the temperature of the previous day. The urine increased as the temperature fell; but when the temperature became stationary, it offered the compensating alternations before referred to. 800 DR.

Urine 44-7 65 65 31 75 30 41 40 7 59 46 In December and January there were various occasions on which frost and thaw rapidly alternated; and the resulting effect upon the urea was one of confusion, as is seen in the following Table:TABLE XXVIII. 1861, Feb. 12 to 16.

At the same time constipation of the bowels occurred, and the system became disordered. Dec. 30.-With a rapid thaw and an increase of 12'-4 of temperature the urea increased 28'9 grs. on the' following day. The urine was so low as 30 3 oz., but rose on the following days to 70 8 oz. and 64 oz. Jan. 11.-With thaw and increase of 60.1 of temperature the urea remained stationary and high, but fell on the following days with frost and falling temperature. The quantity of urine was very low, and yet fell from 42 5 oz. to 37-6 oz. on the same day to 26-6 oz. on the following day, and then rose to 54 oz. with decreasing temperature. On April 24, with 70.8 increase of temperature, the urea rose greatly on the same and on the following day. The excretion of urine was very high, and it increased to 76-7 oz. on the same, and fell to 45-7 oz. on the following day. On July 11, with 5?6 increase of temperature, the urea was lessened on the same and ,on the following days until the fourth day, when it rose 92 grs. with increasing temperature. Whilst in a majority of instances the influence of temperature acts on the day following any important change, it sometimes acts on the same day, and sometimes the effect is contrary to the law. The urine is commonly increased with a sudden fall -and decreased with a sudden rise of temperature on the same day, and the opposite condition occurs on the following day. There are great oscillations, due to the necessity of maintaining a certain equilibrium in the fluids of the body; and these are set in motion by any act which materially varies the emission of fluid, and they continue in a degree and mask the influence of agents which in their absence could be traced in the elimination of the urinary products. OF IJREA AND URINARY WATER. 801 Atnosplheric presszre.-The relation of the, production and elimination -of urea with the barometric elevation is a direct one, so that both rise and fall together. Table III. shows this relation in reference to the monthly averages; so that the month of the highest elimination of urea was that of the greatest atmospheric pressure, and that of the least elimination was that of the least pressure. There is also an unbroken parallelism in the lines as they increase from, March to May, decrease in June, increase in, September, decrease in October, November, and December, and increase in January and' February; but there is a want of correspondence in July and August. When the year is divided into the two seasons already mentioned, the relations of the barometric elevation, temTerature, urea, and urine are as follows:Barometer. Temperature. Urea. -Urine. inches. 0 grs. oz. Summer , 29762 55 570 55-7 Winter....... 299658 44 480 519 The barometric relation is not so evident as it would have been had there not been the exceptional conditions in July and August; but it is sufficient to show that it corresponds with all the other subjects which we have discussed, and that in summer we had high atmospheric pressure and temperature, and great elimination of urea and urinary water, with the contrary conditions during the winter. The relation of sudden changes of the barometric pressure to the.elimination of urea is well seen in the following sequence of days (Plate XXXII. fig. 8):TABLE XXIX. |December ... 11. 12. 13. 14. 15. 1 17. 18. 10. inches. inches. inches. inches. inches. inches. inches. inches. inches.

The temperature was nearly stationary until the 17th, when it fell, and the diminution in the excretion of urea became greater. When the lines of temperature and barometric pressure run parallel, their influence over the elimination of urea is increased; but when they are opposed, their influence is lessened. This is shown in the instance on January 2, when, with great diminution of temperature, there was but slight diminution of urea on the same day, and an actual increase on the following day; for the barometer rose from 29'228 inches on the day before to 29-918 inches on the same day, and to 30143 inches on the following day. An instance of the relation of high barometric indication and elimination of urea is given in the following sequence:TABLE XXX. April 24. April 25. April 26. April 27. April 28. April 29.

SMITH ON THE ELIMINATION The quantity of urea evolved on the 26th and the 29th was somewhat unduly increased by food. I Hence, on summing up the results now obtained, I venture to state that the action, both of temperature and atmospheric pressure, is direct, and that the urea varies as they vary; but the results are oftentimes conflicting. The following are some of the causes of variation from the rule: 1. When the temperature increases and the pressure decreases, and vice versd. 2. When the same cause acts for a lengthened period, the specific effects will be found only in the early days, since the necessity which exists for the maintenance of an equilibrium in the statics of the body induces oscillations, as the two influences are respectively powerful. Hence high atmospheric pressure will at first cause increased elimination of urinary water; but at length a point is reached below which the fluids of the body cannot be reduced consistently with health, and the quantity of urine falls, as is seen in the last Table. 3. Whenever, and from whatever cause, there is an increased elimination of urine, there will usually be an increase in the urea, notwithstanding the influence of adverse atmospheric influences. 4. The effects of meteorological and other influences are frequently carried on to the following day; so that in such a case there will be a modified influence acting on both days, and the distinction will be less perceptible; but sudden increase of pressure commonly caused an immediate increase in the quantity of urine evolved. 5. The actual temperature in which we live is not that of the external atmosphere, and cannot be rigidly determined. With sudden increase of temperature and a low barometer, there is a sense of faintness and fullness, and the elimination of fluid and urea is retarded; whilst with increased atmospheric pressure and decreased temperature, the bulk of the body is lessened with the increased emission of fluids, and there is according to the degree a sense of lightness or of oppression. [Contrast of tie daily inquiries during two consecutive years, viz. fron March 1860 to March 1862. (Plate XXXVI.) The long interval which has elapsed since the preparation of this paper has permitted me to continue the daily inquiries through another year, and has afforded me the singular advantage of being able to compare the daily quantities through the several seasons of two successive years, and I have been permitted to add the figures to the Tables (p. 759 et seq.), and to represent the oppositions and agreements in the quantities recorded in Plate XXXVI. I now append a short Summary of the points in which the latter year has agreed or contrasted with the former. Conditions of the inquiry.-During the last year the health has been as uniformly maintained as before; but there has been somewhat less of bodily exertion, and the weight of the body hasincreased about ten pounds. The daily inquiries hae been made with OF -UREA AND URINARY WATER. 803 somewhat fewer intermissions; and there have been fewer experiments, which might interfere somewhat with the regular nutrition of the system. The summer holiday was again taken, and a month was again spent at the sea-side. The only important condition of contrast refers to the frequency of the analyses of urea; for, whilst in the former year there were always three, and often more analyses daily, with a view to determine the excretion at the different periods of the day, in the latter there was but one daily. Hence in the past year it has not been possible to restrict the day to uniform hours, viz. from 8 A.M. as before, since, without knowing the rate of excretion proceeding in the night, no correct addition or subtraction of quantities could be made for defect or excess of time. The twenty-four hours has therefore terminated at periods from 8 to 92 A.M., but commonly it ended at about 82 A.M.; and the addition and subtraction has been made by the average rate of emission of the twenty-four hours. The former was doubtless the more correct method; but the latter, by not reducing the day to a uniform hour, has not introduced any material error. It must also be recorded that, as there are errors of inquiry connected with LIEBIG'S analysis for urea (as indeed with all other inquiries), they have been varied by the reduction of the number of daily analyses. I am not able to state whether this has rendered the total computation of the daily excretion more or less correct, since it is not known in what direction the errors in the analyses lie, or whether the direction is the same with different inquirers; but, considering that it lies in the appreciation of the exact degree of colour in the test solution, and knowing the degree of care which I have taken, I am inclined to believe that the tendency in my hands would be to lessen the quantity as the experiments were fewer. Meteorological conditions.-The former year was remarkable for its cold summer and the long-continued frost of winter, whilst the latter, without being a hot year, was warmer in both summer and winter. Each year comprehends a part of two cold seasons, and the summer season, since it begins at the middle of March. The average temperature of the latter year was 2? 2 higher than that of the former. With the exception of May and September, February and March, the monthly temperature was higher; and the difference in May was only a defect 00.4. The increase of temperature was particularly found in June, July, August, and October, in which the average monthly increase was 40.4, 3?1, 5?6, and 40.3 respectively. The highest mean daily temperature was 9? 8 higher, and the lowest mean daily temperature was 6?8 higher, in the latter than in the former year on the days of inquiry. The pressure of the atmosphere was also somewhat higher in the latter than the former year, the excess being -033 inch. The monthly averages on the days of inquiry were higher, except in July, September, October, February, and March; and the increase was particularly found in April, May, August, and December, in the last of which it was -450 inch. The most marked months of defect were September and March. As we have shown that the opposition in the movements of these two elements of season have an important influence. it may be remarked that the two years corresponded in April and July, but differed in MDCCcLxI. 5 Q 804 DR SMITH ON TEE ELIMINATION September and January, with opposition 'in the former year, and in July and March in the latter year. Elimination of Vrea.-The total yearly average was less in the latter than in the former year; but the general course throughout the months of the year was the same. The average daily elimination, however, was greater in March (both), July, and August, but particularly in August, whilst the month of the greatest defect was September. In reference to this difference, it must be remarked that the months of greatest divergence were those of difference in the opposition of temperature and atmospheric pressure, and also that the conditions recorded in the month of September were very different in the two years. It has been remarked that in both years August and part of September were spent at Scarborough, and that there was doubtless some increase of nitrogenous food and exertion; and in reference to food, the increase was certainly greater in the latter than in the former year, and may account for the excess of urea in August. In reference to the divergence in September, it is to be remarked that in the former year only six days were included, and those were spent at Scarborough; whilst in the latter year twelve days were referred to, and all of them were spent in London and hence with difference of conditions there were differences of results. The highest daily elimination of urea occurred in the latter and the least in the former year. Elimination of Urinary Watery-The quantity of urinary water evolved was -less in the latter than in the former year, and the difference occurred in every month of the year except March and May, but chiefly in the summer season. The greatest defect was 10 ounces daily in August. The defect in the winter half of the year was not considerable. Weight of Body.-The foregoing differences render it very desirable to ascertain in what degree the weight of the body had increased with the diminution of excretion of fluid, and to compare the weight in the two years. The latter information cannot be given, since the inquiries in reference to weight were commenced only at the end of the preceding year; but the former may be abundantly supplied. The general expression is that the weight increased rapidly and greatly from April to October, with a decrease in May and November, and a second increase to the end of the year. The increase was about 10 lbs. from February to October; and thenceforward the monthly average varied in both directions within limits of 12 ounces. Hence, with the conditions of the year, the habits during the year, and the lessened elimination of fluid by the kidneys, there was a marked increase in the weight of the body. It may be added as a general expression, that whilst the special conditions of each year caused and permitted variations in the vital and physical actions of the body, there was such a general influence exerted that the course of the changes remained the same.j 7. Relation of Urea to exertion. The effect of exertion has, until very recently, been determined only in an indefinite OF UREA AND URINARY WATER. 805 manner and during short periods. DRAPER, SPECK, and J. LEHMANN found no increase in the urea, whilst C. J. LEHMANN, HAMMOND, BENEKE, and B3EIGEL found a variable increase not exceeding 25 per cent. When much sweating occurred, as it commonly did with severe exertion, it was assumed that urea had been lost by the perspiration, in accordance with the results obtained by FUNKE and MEISSNER. The excretion of urinary water varied in the different experiments. VOIT has, I believe, recently ascertained that with prolonged exertion a dog did not emit any materially increased quantity of ureaa result which will now be shown to correspond with my own preceding and contemporaneous experiments. The relation of urea to exertion was determined by the second series of inquiries, viz. those made on four prisoners from March 1 to March 26, 1860. The treadwheel is a revolving drum, with steps placed at distances of 8 inches upon the outside of the cylinder; and the prisoners are required to turn the wheel downwards by stepping upwards. The rapidity of revolution is regulated partly by the weight of the prisoners, and partly by a governor, and therefore is not absolutely uniform. The prisoners grasp a crossbar, and partly hang by it, and the body is held behind its centre of gravity. They were engaged in this labour in alternate quarters of an hour, the intervening periods being occupied in perfect rest in the sitting posture. The duration of this mingled labour and rest was from -7.15 to 8.25 A.M., 10.10 A.M. to 1.50 P.M., and 3.10 to 5.20 P.M.; so that the total period of actual labour daily was 31 hours. The total ascent per hour of continuous labour was 2160 feet, and per day 1'432 mile. The average weight of each man at the end of the inquiry was 105'125 lbs., 108'125 lbs., 120-5 lbs., and 122'625 lbs. avoirdupois, and of the whole 113'75 lbs.; and therefore the number of tons which they lifted 1 foot per day was as follows, upon the data used by Professor HAUGHTON.TABLE XXXI. No. of prisoner .................. 858. 948. 1040. 1041. Average of all. Weight in lbs. .... 105125 108U125 120'5 122 625 113'75 Tons, 1 foot daily .... 35481 356-76 406'56 413-89 383'9 Hence the average labour of each man was represented by lifting 384 tons through 1 foot per day, and this was exacted on alternate days only, on Tuesday, Thursday, and Saturday, whilst Sunday was a day of almost unbroken rest. There were during the inquiry ten days of treadwheel labour, ten of very light labour, and four of perfect rest. Their daily dietary was as follows:20 oz. of excellent brown bread, one pint of cocoa, one pint of oatmeal gruel, 6 oz. of cooked meat without bone (41 oz. lean and 11 oz. fat), 8 oz. of boiled potatoes, about 1 oz. of salt, 10 oz. of water at midday, at 2 P.M. with dinner, and at 4 P.M. No. 1040 had 62 oz. of bread daily. All the food was eaten, and the quantity of salt was regulated to three-quarters of an ounce daily on March 7. Thus the average solid food was 34 oz. (plus 6% oz. bread for 1040, and the ingredients in the gruel and cocoa in all the 5 Q2 806 DR. SMITH ON THE ELIMINATIONcases), and fluid 70 oz. daily. They were well inured to prison discipline and dietary; and all gained weight during the inquiry, except 1041, who lost a few ounces. Tlhey were in fair health, and willingly lent themselves to the inquiry. Their age, height, and occupation were as follows: TABLE XXXII. No. of prisoner ... 858. 948. 1040. 1041. Age 31 32 43 22 Height ... 5 ft. 24 inches. 5 ft. 2T inches. 5 ft. 51 inches. 5 ft. 7 inches. Occupation ... Plasterer. Grocer. Butcher. Labourer. Hence their average age, height, and weight were 32 years, 5 ft. 4-4 inches, and 113-75 lbs. The object of the inquiry was to ascertain the weight of urea, chloride of sodium, urinary water and faeces, and to determine by final analysis the amount of nitrogen and ash in the food and in the urinary and feacal excretions. There were also some variations in the food supplied during the inquiry. Thus, no salt was allowed from the dinner on March 10 to the dinner on March 14, except that added to the gruel; 3oz. of extra fat were given daily from March 14 to the end of March 17; half an ounce of tea was given daily with the water from midday on March 18 to the end of March 24; 1-1 oz. of coffee was given daily from 1 P.M. on March 22 to the end of March 23; and lastly, 2 oz. of alcohol were given daily from the afternoon of March 24 to the end of March 26,the duration of these latter inquiries being three days each. The urine was collected from March 2 to March 17, from 6to 7A.M1. whilst the prisoners were preparing for their duties and were more or less exposed to the open air; and this was regarded as the basis quantity, or that excreted in the absence of food and labour. On the treadwheel days a further quantity was collected from 7.15 to 8.25 A.M., during the treadwheel labour and before fluid or solid food had been taken. After these periods the whole of the urine was collected until 51 P.M., when the prisoners were locked up for the night; and lastly, the urine passed from 52 P.m. until 6A.M. was collected. On Sundays (and also on weekdays after March 17) there were but two collections, viz. at 6-1 A.M. and 51P.M. The urine of each man was collected separately, and care taken that not the smallest quantity was lost; and whilst the faces of each man were weighed separately, the whole was passed into one vessel, and a fair sample submitted to final analysis. Urea. The following Table contains the basal quantities of urea passed from 74 to 8.25 A.M. on each morning (except Sundays) from March 2 to 17, when that part of the inquiry terminated. It will be recollected that the quantity of salt allowed was reduced to three-quarters of an ounce on March 7, and that no salt was given (except that contained in the gruel) from March 10 at dinner time to March 14 at dinner time.

On the average of the three others the quantity evolved per hour during the treadwheel labour was '2 gr. less than that evolved at rest, viz. 14'4 grs. and 14'6 grs. per hour, but when the returns of No. 1041 are added, the defect with the treadwheel labour is no less than 2'4 grs. per hour. There was some diversity in the returns of each of the three cases; so that in one the quantity of urea was the same under both conditions, in another it was 2 5 grs. in excess with rest, and in the third there was 1'9 gr. in excess with labour. The numbers of times in which any excess was found with labour over rest in the three cases were 28, 33, and 71 per cent. in the order above given. The greatest excess with labour was 7-5 grs., and the greatest defect with labour was 5'3 grs. per hour, and both occurred in the same person. In onethird of all these exceptions the excess was less than I gr. per hour. 'Hence it is shown that violent exertion has no definite influence over the excretion of urea in the absence of food. The following Table contains the results of the daily average of urea, chloride of sodium, and water, in each of the cases during the whole period of inquiry, distinguishing the days of treadwheel labour from those of comparative rest, and indicating the periods when certain additional foods were administered (Plate XXV.).

UREA AND URINARY WATER. 80-9 The average of all the observations gives the following results. On Sundays the elimination was to the extent of 494 grs., on days of comparative rest 512 grs., and on treadwheel days 528 grs. The increase on the days of treadwheel labour over that of merely routine labour was 16 grs. per day. The prisoner No;. 1041, to whose exceptional returns I have before alluded, had no average increase with treadwheel labour, but, on the contrary, there was an average decrease of 51 grs., and the increase was carried on to the following day. The three other cases exhibited an increase of 37 grs., 59 grs., and 21 grs. daily, or an average of the three of 42 grs. daily with labour. None of the cases were without an exception in the relative influence of treadwheel and mere routine labour; but one had two, another had three, and two had four exceptional days on which there was no increase on the treadwheel days. These instances are marked in the Table with an asterisk. When there was no increase on the treadwheel days, there was an increase on the following day of rest; and this irregularity alternated several times in succession. The cause of these exceptions is not clear; but I am fully convinced that it is not due to any error, nor to any change in the dietary or the habits of the men. There were, however, two noticeable meteorological conditions at the periods when the marked variations occurred. Thus, from March 6 to March 11 the temperature fell from 400 to 30 9, when the exceptions in No. 1040 occurred, and rose considerably on the day on which the exceptions ended, and at the same period the barometer rose very greatly, and remained at above 30 inches until the day before the exceptions terminated. These would exert a mutually opposing influence. The contrary conditions occurred on the exceptional days in case No. 1041 for the temperature rose from 300.9 to 46? 5 from March 11 to March 20, when the exceptions ended; and the barometer having fallen to 29-570 inches on the day when the exceptions began, reached 30'012 inches on the day on which they terminated. There is thus at least a singular coincidence in the existence of these disturbing causes and a succession of exceptional results; and on each occasion the usual effect of the treadwheel labour over the eliminttion of urea was retarded one day. The largest increase from the treadwheel labour was 144 grains, and the largest decrease was 100 grs. of urea per day. The following Table contains the percentage results of this inquiry.

SMITH ON THE, ELIMINATION In order to ascertain how far the addition of alcohol, tea, and coffee may have modified these results, I have in the last column of the preceding Table separated the average returns before those substances were administered. The exceptional case, No. 1041, was regular up to that period, and on the whole average yielded a small increase on treadwheel days ; but the general results in the other cases were varied only so far as that the effect of the treadwheel was less on the short than on the long average. The average amount of urea excreted daily to each pound weight of the body is as follows; and for comparison I have added the proportion in myself. TABLE XXXVI. No. of prisoner ........................ 858. 948. 1040. 1041. Averag.e of 'Myself. Urea, grs. to each lb . 4.61 4 4 74 4 58 4-39 4*58 2*73 The foregoing facts prove that, whilst there is no average increase in the elimination of urea during the period of actual treadwheel labour without food, there is a small increase in the production on the whole day when ordinary food is taken; but on some occasions this increase is not eliminated on the day of labour, but on the following one of rest. The proportion of urea to the weight of the body on the whole period of labour and rest combined, is 59 per cent. greater than is observed in myself with much greater weight, less food, and less labour. RUDOLPH found that during fasting there was an increase in the solids in the urine emitted, on the increasing weights of the men; but BENEKE and others have shown that, whilst there may be this general relation, there is much diversity in the results. Moreover, since in one person the bones, and in another the fat, may be relatively heavier than the muscle in a third, and since in relation to body weight the amount of food and the activity of the vital functions vary much, it is impossible that there should be any strict relation. In the case of these prisoners there was but little fat, and the bones were not unusually large, and the muscular system was over worked and under fed. They did not lose weight during this inquiry; but they had been long imprisoned, and the weight with which the final weighing was compared was not that on their entrance into the prison, but the reduced one at the period of this inquiry. It is probable that the knowledge of the relation of urea to body weight is of very little value. Urinary Water. The excretion of urinary water was greater on treadwheel days than on days of comparative rest. On the whole cases combined the daily quantity was 69-6 oz. on the former and 64'6 oz. on the latter days, or an increase of nearly 8 per cent. on the days of severe labour. The relative amounts evolved during the first ten days, before any variation of the food occurred, were 74'7 and 67'7 oz., giving an increase with labour of 1O*4 per cent. The rule thus established weas not maintained without variation; but on every short OF UREA AND UTRINARY WATER. 811 average, and in all the cases, it was observed. The following Table contains the average quantities of urinary water emitted in each of the cases from March 2 to March 10, with the treadwheel and with light labour. TABLE XXXVII.

The elimination of chloride of sodium was commonly less on treadwheel than on the other days, but the difference was not very considerable. On the average of all the observations during the first ten days, the quantity of chloride of sodium evolved daily was 509 grs. with treadwheel, and 520 grs. with light labour. After that period the chloride of sodium was temporarily withheld; but upon the average of all the observations throughout the inquiry, the amount of that salt emitted was slightly less on treadwheel than on other days, the actual quantities being 432 grs. and 4 37 grs. There was much variation in the results both on the same and on different prisoners. Ewces. The analyses of the fieces were made by Mr. MANNING, from March 2 to March 16 inclusive, including two Sundays, six treadwheel, and six light-labour days. There was no instance in this part of the inquiry of the evacuation being of a purged character. Nos. 858 and 1040 had only one day without an evacuation, and No. 948 had an evacuation daily; but No. 1041 in but one instance had more than one evacuation every second day. The analysis on each day was made from the evacuation of that day; and therefore on everv alternate day there was no foccal analysis in the case of No. 1041. In determining the amount of the nitrogen emitted by the feces daily, I have been compelled to admit a small error by dividing the quantity of faces evacuated by No. 1041, on each occasion, equally between that and the preceding day, and to adopt a similar plan on the two exceptional occasions just mentioned in reference to the other prisoners. This prevents the accurate determination of the amount of nitrogen evolved by No. 1041 on any particular day, as, for example, on the feadwheel days, and so far lessens the characteristic results of each day, on the average of the whole cases. I have also referred the fieces to the preceding day, as they are clearly connected with the food of that day. The following Table gives the total daily weight of the fresh feces, with the total day emissions of nitrogen, and the amount of water, nitrogen, and ash in each ounce of the fresh feces.

The uniform weight of solid food taken daily was 38 oz., and consequently the weight of the feces on the average was 22k1 per cent. of that of solid food. The largest emission of faces was on the Sunday, when it was 44-3, 70, and 74 per cent. higher than the average of all the days in the three first-mentioned cases. There was a smaller evacuation on the wheel days than on the average of all days, in two of the cases to the extent of 14 8 and 21-1 per cent.; but in the third case both averages were the same. The average diminution, as compared with the quantities evacuated on Sundays, was 41, 53*3, and 42 6 per cent. The least evacuation occurred on the Saturday, which was also a treadwheel day; and in the three cases the diminution below the whole average was 26-1, 57-6, and 34-6 per cent.; but it was less than that of the Sunday by no less than 48, 75, and 62 per cent. The amount of water contained in the fieces was very uniform, viz. 73.5 per cent. on the average, and varied only from 71-8 to 77 6 per cent. on different days. It was not above the average on Sundays, and it was a little below the average on the treadwheel days. The quantity of nitrogen in each ounce of faces varied from 4-36 to 4 9 grs., and on the average it was 4-646 grs. The total quantity contained in the daily evacuation of feeces was an average amount of 41 8 grs. There was a considerable increase on the Sunday, and a marked decrease on Saturday, and it was below the average on the treadwheel days,-the actual amount on the three days being 59 9, 35 8, and 40 53 grs., or an increase of 43.3 per cent., and a decrease of 14 3 and 3 per cent. Hence on Sundays there was a diminution in the amount of urea evolved from March 2 to the 16th, of 13 grs. and 18 grs. in the first two cases, but there was increase QC UREAH AND 1RJh WATER. $ in the nitrogen evolved in the fteces by the three cases, which when reckoned as urea amounted to 17-33 grs. There was no decrease in the quantity of urea on Sundays at this period by the third case, but, on the contrary, there was an increase of 52 grs. above the average of all days. The loss of nitrogen in the urine was thus found in the fieces. The case which was allowed 6H oz. of extra bread per day had the largest amount of faces on the average, and the largest increase of faces on Sundays. The total average excretion of feces was X73 per cent. greater than in myself, with an equal amount of food and much more exertion. The foregoing investigation has elicited the following facts. 1. The prisoners emitted much more urea and fwces than occurs in health under ordinarycircumstances. 2. On Sundays the amount of urea was commonly lessened, but the nitrogen in the feces was increased-in the same proportion. The whole weight of feeces was increased. 3. With treadwheel labour there was a small increase in the amount of urea and of -urine evolved, whilst there was a small decrease in the evolution of chloride of sodium by the urine, the weight of the faeces, and the nitrogen contained in the feees. On" Saturdays, with treadwheel labour the diminution in the fteces and the contained nitrogen was considerable. 4. With increase in the allowance of bread there was a considerable increase in the weight of the fitces, and particularly with rest.

The analysis for urea was made by LIEBIG'S method 'in the manner already described in reference to the experiments at Coldbath Fields. The total average daily quantity of urea evolved was 6 5565 grs., of which 608A4 grs. were emitted by the Tailors, and 702'9 grs. by-theWeavers. The maximum and'minimumn amounts were 790 grs. and 456 grs.,.-the former in the Weavers and the -latter in the Tailors. In the Weavers the quantity exceeded 700 grains on seven of thirteen days, whilst it occurred only three times during that period in the Tailors; and in only one instance during the inquiry was it below 500 grs. daily. The quantity of urea to each pound of body-weight (p. 810) was 4 812 grs. in the Tailors, and 4 '675 grs.' in the Weavers; but it varied in the former from 3 72 grs. to 5 82 grs., and in the latter from 3'62 grs. to, 5-39 grs. on different days. The quantity of urea eliminated was always lessened on the Sunday (pp. 809 812). The diminution in the Tailors from the Saturday to the Sunday was 145 grs. and 122 grs., and in 'the 'Weavers 26 grs. and 92 grs., yielding an average diminution of 96'25 grs. The quantity of urea in each ounce of urine was on the average 14-9 grs. in the Tailors, ,and 15'25 grs. in the Weavers, giving a total average of 15 075 grs. The maxi'munm and minimum quantities were 18-8 grs. and 12 3 grs. in the Tailors, and 17 84 grs. and 13-53 grs. in the Weavers. WeT*ht of Body (p. 810). The average weight of three of the prisoners during the inquiry was greater than that recorded on the day preceding the commencement of the inquiry; but there was a loss of weight of the fourth. The average gain of the Tailors was 151 oz. and 17i oz.,' and of one of the Weavers 3* oz., but the other Weaver lost 33 oz. The greatest gain in the different cases was 1 lb. 131 oz. and 1 lb. 7U oz. in the Tailors, and 813 oz. and 1 lb. 11 oz. in the Weavers; and the greatest loss was 1 oz. 'in one Tailor, and 1 lb. 2 *L oz. and 4oz. in the Weavers. There was not any unvarying progression in the weight during the week; but in every case there was an increase from the Saturday to the Sunday, and the amount was as follows: 11* oz. and 101 oz., 91 oz. and 5 oz. in the Tailors; 6* oz. and 18* oz., 19* oz. and 31-oz. in the Weavers, or an average increase on the Sunday of 13'62 oz. Urine (p. 810). 1. Quantity.-The largest quantity of urine evolved in one day was 25,321 grs. (56 6 oz.) and 26,624 grs. (59417 oz.) in the Tailors, 27,791 grs. (62'3 oz.) and 32,924 grs. (74 oz.) in the Weavers. -The average daily -quantity was 41-2 oz. in the Tailors, and 47'51 oz. in the WeaveTs, giving a total daily average of 44*35 oz.

Specific Gravity.The specific gravity of theurine varied from 1016 to 1027'5, but there was singular uniformity in the general results. In the Tailors it was 1023'7 and 1025, and in the Weavers 1024'37 and 1024'6, giving a total average of 1024'35 in the Tailors and 1024-45 in the Weavers. Chloride of Soditm (p 811). The average quantity of chloride of sodium evolved was 3'37 grs. per oz. in the Tailors, and 3:18 grs. er oz-. in the Weavers, giving a daily emission of 138 8 grs, in the former, and 148-5 grs. in the latter. Jies (P.: 811). The general character of the freces was homogeneous and moderately cohesive; but on a few occasions -there was variety in the consistence. In the 52 observations, 32 exhibited feeces formed but soon subsiding, 7 wvell-formed, 1 scybalous, 2 soft, and 9 of mixed characters; and no one prisoner offered any very marked difference in those conditions. The trace of the bran of the bread was easily seen in the faices. The average daily evacuation was 6'98 oz. in the Tailors, and 8'52 oz. in the Weavers, giving' a total daily average of 7'75 oz. There were somewhat considerable daily variations; so that the maximum and minimum quantities were in the Tailors 1141 oz. and 4'32 oz., and in the Weavers 14'42 oz. and 1P72 oz.; but in no instance was there the omission of a daily evacuation. The quantity of nitrogen per cent. found by Mr. MANNING by the volumetric method, varied from '71 gr. to 1 16 gr. in the Tailors, and from 97 gr. to P 35 gr. in the Weavers; but the total average in the two classes was '93 gr. in the Tailors and 112 gr. in the Weavers, giving 1'025 gr. on the whole. The total daily elimination of nitrogen by the fteces were found to be 27-43 grs. in the Tailors, and 40'93grs. in the Weavers. The variation in the amount of faeces on Sunday from that of other days was not uniform in quantity, since it was less on Sunday than on week days in the Weavers, and was equal in the Tailors. Such is a summary statement of the results obtained in the inquiry on two classes of prisoners, one of which followed a sedentary and non-laborious occupation, whilst the 818 DR. SMITH ON THE ELIMINATION other really performed hard labour; and it will be observed that there were many differences in the results obtained from them. Both classes had a similar and substantial dietary, but there were certain personal differences. Thus, the weavers of cocoa-matting in the wide loom, when compared with the Tailors, were older, taller, heavier, and broader. They ate more bread, milk, and water. They lost weight, whilst the Tailors gained weight. They emitted more urine, urea, chloride of sodium, and faeces with their contained nitrogen. They exhibited much less diminution in the amount of urea evolved on the Sunday, and a little less urea to body-weight. It is not possible to compare the results of this inquiry very closely with those already described in reference to Coldbath Fields, since the conditions in each set of experimen ts were not identical. At Coldbath Fields the quantity of bread and water was rigidly fixed, whilst at Wakefield there were daily variations according to the desires of the prisoners. The quantity of bread eaten was greater at Wakefield than at Coldbath Fields, and would so far increase the amount of urea produced, whilst the variable quantity of water taken from day to day would at the same gaol vary the elinination of that product. Yet these causes of variation have only a certain value; and upon the whole it will be seen that there is a very close correspondence between the excretions of the Weavers at Wakefield and those who worked the treadwheel at Coldbath Fields. The weight of the men at Wakefield was greater than that of the prisoners at Coldbath Fields; the quantity of urine and of fluid drank was less, and that of urea was greater; but the proportion of urea to body-weight was very nearly the same at the two prisons. In both there was more urea evolved on days of hard labour, and less on Sunday. There was less chloride of sodium evolved, as there was less supplied in the food. The weight of the feces and the contained nitrogen was the same at both places.] 8. Certain relations of Urea to Food. All observers have found that the amount of urea varied with the food taken, and was the greatest with that food which yielded the most nitrogen-as, for example, albumen and gelatine. This has been well established by LEHMANN, BIDDER and SCHMiDT, and LAWES and GILBERT, and many others of the best repute; and there was usually a correspondence between the increase in the nitrogen supplied and excreted, if the body-weight remained the same. I Ihave in former parts of this paper referred to the Influence which food exerts upon the excretion of urea, and particularly in the effect of absence of food over the hourly rate of excretion, and the effect of increased food on Sundays. I propose now to show the effect of food taken at a late hour, and of unusual kind and quantity, as occurred on various occasions at dinner and evening parties during the year, and then to refer to a few special experiments on foods. OF UREA AND URINARY WATER. 819 Instances of excess of Urea after -Dinner and Evening Parties, when 'no excess in food or wine, in the ordinary acceptation of the term, was committed. Dinner.-Feb. 25. The urea increased from 453A4 grs. on the preceding day, and an average of 438r8 grs. on the three preceding days, to 594-3 and 582 grs. on the same and the succeeding day; also to an average of 648 grs. on the two following days, and 517 2 grs. on the fourth day, and afterwards it fell to 488 and 483 grs. The quantity of urea emitted on the first night was 60 per cent. greater than on the preceding night. &pper.-Feb. 9. There was no increase in the urea emitted during the night, but on the following day the increase was 144 grs. Supper.--Feb. 16. The urea increased from 470-6 grs. on the previous day to 539 6, 543.7, 534^4, and 522J1 grs. on succeeding days, and fell to 397 grs. on the fourth day. There was an increase on the fiist night, and the basis quantity on the following morning was increased 49 per cent.IDinner, a bottle of Moselle.-March 8. There was an increase of 125 grs. of urea during the night, and a maximum increase of 230 grs. on the following day. SDinner, pint of mixed wine.-March 23. There was no increase in the quantity of urea until the second day. Stpper.-April 12. There was an increase during the night and on the two following days to the extent of 100 grs. on each day. Supper.-April 19. After merely taking cream and wine there was an increase during the night, and the basis quantity on the following morning wtas increased 33 per cent. Soiree.-April 21. There was an increase of 54 grs. during the nlight, and the basis quantity was elevated. Supper.-April 26. There was an increase during the night of 76 grs. of urea, and it continued through the next day. S&pper, meseat and ale.-May 11 There was an increase of 42 grs. of urea on the day following. The supper was followved by a sensation of excess. Supper..-Nov. 22. The urea increased from 490 grs. to 548 grs., and fell on the administration of medicine. Snpier.-Dec. 12. The increase in the urea during the night was 7 grs. per hour, and on the following three days it was 100, 130, and 134 grs. Dinner.-Dec. 30. The urea was increased 63 per cent. during the night, and on the next day the increase was 92 grs. Dinner.-Jan. 31. After taking three or four glasses of strong wine and dining heartily I was ill, and vomited very acid matter. There was an increase of 3-4 grs. of urea during the day, but on the next day the quantity was lessened. [Examples of a similar kind are recorded in the Tables, p. 759 et seq., on March 27, April 15, May 18 and 20, Junie 12, November 18 and 30, 1861, and February 1, 1862.] MDcccLXI. 5 S 820 DR. SMITH ON THE ELIMINATION Hence in every instance, and at all periods of the year, when food of an unusual kind and in unusual quantity was taken and retained, an increase in the elimination of urea immediately followed, and continued during periods varying from one to four days.. In reference to the influence of wine, I have remarked that on the occasion. on which the wine was not good, and any stomach derangement followed, there was a much larger emission of urea than occurred with a greater quantity of wine of fine quality. [Millk supper was also followed by an increased elimination of urea on May 18, July 11 and 21, September 23; and the same result followed the eating of crab and cow-heel on May 13 and December 1, but the effect was not uniform.] The ih/fltence of some special kinds of food. As many of the experiments in reference to the action of foods did not extend beyond a part of a day, they cannot show any influence over the daily excretion of urea, and I shall not here refer. to them. On the occasion on which I lived on bread with water, tea, and coffee during three days, the total amount of urea, the quantities of urea and urinary water, were as follows:TABLE XLI. 34 34 oz. bread, 34 oz. bread, 4 oz. broad, 48 oz. water, 48 oz. water, 350 grs. tea. 2 oz. coffee.

There can be no doubt, however, that there was a considerable diminution of urea on the day on which bread and water alone were taken; but there was a progressive increase on the two following days, when tea and coffee were administered. On the following day, when bread and water only were taken until 2ih P.M., and then plenty of additional food, the urea increased to 507 2 grs. The diminution in the excretion of urine with the tea was in part the result of the large elimination on the preceding day. The quantity evolved with the coffee was normal. The appetite was lessened under the influence of coffee, and there was an odour of coffee in the urine. If we accept HAUGHTON'S analysis of bread, and consider that 1 oz. of fine bread is equivalent to 12-25 grs. of urea, we find that on the first day there were 25 grs. of urea eliminated by the urine more than could have been contained in the bread. On the occasion when extra foods were given to the prisoners, the following were the average results obtained : OF UREA AND URINLARY WATIERt $21 TABLE XLII. 32oz. extra fat.

Hence the extra fat produced no average change in the excretion of urea and urine; but in No. 858 both were diminished, and in No. 1041 the urea was increased. BOUCKER and BISCHOFF have shown that, in the ordinary conditions of the system, an increase in the quantity of fat supplied does not vary the amount of urea evolved. The urea was greatly lessened under the influence of the tea, but that occurred chiefly on the first and second day; for, whilst it fell to 442 grs. on the second day, it rose to 508 grs. on the third, which was a treadwheel day. There is not, however, an unexceptionable basis of comparison, since it is very probable that the average of the three preceding days was unduly increased by two of the three having been treadwheel days; and hence it is probable that the diminution in the excretion of urea under the influence of tea is less than is now represented. The average excretion of urine was unchanged. The urea rose under the action of the coffee 42 grs. daily, and nearly reached the point from whence it fell before the tea had been administered. The quantity of urine remained unchanged. Professor LEHIMANN found that theime increased the elimination of urea; but TB6CKER and HAMMOND state the contrary to be the action of tea, whilst at the same time they affirm, that the urinary water is unaffected. The urinary water was observed by LEHMANN, B6CKER, and HAMMOND to be increased, and the urea to be decreased, in various degrees by the action of coffee. The alcohol caused a further diminution in the amount of urea to the extent of 26 grs. per day; but it yet remained 14 grs. per day higher than the point to which it first fell with the tea. In each of three regular cases the alcohol prevented the increased elimination which usually occurred from them on the treadwheel days, and rendered the amount on that day 43 grs. less than it had been with rest on the preceding day; but the urea rose on the third day from 466 grs. with the treadwheel labour, and 446 on the Sunday, to 557 grs. on the Monday. The amount of urine was reduced nearly 20 oz. per day on the average of the whole of the prisoners, and in each of them. The barometer fell so low as 28'904 in. on the first day of the administration of the alcohol, and would therefore tend to lessen the elimination of urea. TiC1KER and HAMMOND found that the addition of moderate quantities of alcohol to the ordinary diet lessened the excretion both of urea and urinary water. -Tea, coffee, and alcohol, but particularly the latter, had, in my experiments, the powver 5s 2 822DR. SMITH ON THE ELIMINATION of retarding the elimination of urea for one or two days; but on the third day this power ceased. The same was observed of other changes of diet, as, for example, the omission of salt and the addition of fat,-the former causing a diminution of 26 grs. from the amount on the treadwheel day (when only 10 grs. had been added by the treadwheel day), and the latter a loss of 6 grs., although it was a treadwheel day. The increase with the salt, fat, and coffee occurred on the second day; but with tea and alcohol it was deferred until the third day, and even then the normal quantity of urine was not restored with the alcohol. There was no disturbance of the health during these investigations, except that No. 1040 was once purged with the coffee; and with the alcohol all complained of being lazy at their work and thirsty, and they noticed that they passed less urine and slept more profoundly. Chloride of Sodium. Abstinence from the use of chloride of sodium was found by WUNDT to diminish the quantity of urinary water, and to lessen the amount of chloride of sodium excreted with it progressively through a period of five days. The rate of excretion of chloride of sodium, when three-quarters of an ounce was allowed daily besides that which was contained in the bread and gruel, was, on the average of all the cases, 506 grs. daily. When only that was allowed which was contained in the bread and gruel, the daily emission was reduced to 184 grs. On -renewing the full quantity, and adding 3oz. of extra fat, the rate increased to 419 grs. daily, which was a less quantity than that which was recorded when the supply of salt had long been unlimited. The quantity was increased 123 grs. daily under the use of tea, and then fell 48 grs. daily with coffee; and a further loss of 142 grs. daily occurred with the alcohol. The average elimination under these different conditions was as follows: TABLJ XLIII. Unlimited 4 oz. less Full supply, Full supply, Full supply, Full supply, supply. supplied. extra fat. tea. coffee. alcohol. grs. daily. grs. daily. grs. daily. grs. daily. grs. daily. grs. daily. Chloride of Sodium ... 506 184 419 542 494 352 The very large supply and elimination of chloride of sodium in prisoners is remarkable, the elimination under ordinary conditions being nearlyequal to that of urea. The diminution in the excretion, when the supply had been lessened by three-quarters of an ounce, was almost identical with the diminution of the supply. Thus the loss was 322 grs., and the diminution in the supply was 328 grs. As the lessened elimination during the experiment with extra fat immediately followed the last experiment, it may perhaps be doubted whether some portion of the salt supplied had not been retained, to mneet the deficiency previously existing; but the increase with tea and coffee, and parOF UREA ANDI URINARY WATER. 823 ticularly with the former, cannot admit of doubt. The very large diminution in the excretion of -chloride of sodium under the action of alcohol corresponds with the lessened excretion of urinary water, so that the former fell 27-5 and the latter 28-7 per cent. The diminution was much greater than that of urea, which was only 5 per cent. on the average of the three days. 9. Relation of the Excretion of Urea to headache, deranged stomach, and a sense of general malaise. I was not subject to any serious illness during the year, but on various occasions, for a day or two at a time, I had derangement of the stomach accompanied by headache, and much nervous irritability and depression. The observations which were then made show that this condition was commonly accompanied by lessened excretion of urea and urine, and the relief of it with increased excretion; but the smaller amount of urea was not necessarily much below the average. I have tabulated the observations in the following manner for convenience of analysis: TABLE XLIV. Urea. Date. State of health. Urine. Urea. Sequence of days. Previous.'Actual. Succeedmng. June 4.

It is very likely that all the conditions above mentioned werel not identical; but they show that in all the attacks of illness which I had the elimination of urea was disturbed. Commonly the elimination of urea was temporarily lessened, and had been above the average amount. The effect upon the urine was not uniform; but the very largely increased elimination of urine, with lessened elimination of urea, in the two instances in which food disagreed were very striking. In every instance of headache the relief was attended by a return to the usual rate of elimination of urea. Thlere was not, on those 824 Dl,. -SMITH ON T-il ELIMINATION occasions, any material change in the quantity of food taken; for aperiernts Band emetics were had recourse to, and relief was soon obtained. [The years 1861 and 1862, Table I. p. 759 et seq., offer numerous records in which the quantity of urea eliminated was temporarily lessened under the influence of oppressive weather or of internal conditions, causing headache and general malaise. Such are May 14 and 21, and 28 to 31; June 14; July 2 to 5 and 20; October 8; November 3 and 4, 6 and 8; December 6 to 10, 161; and January 26, 1862.] The effect of purging over the elimination of urea was commonly inconsiderable; but in one instance there was a great diminution of both urea and urine. 10. Relation of Urea an d Carbonic Acid. Scarcely any observations have hitherto been made in reference to the relation of urea and carbonic acid; but BECHER (HENLE'S ' Zeits.' 1855) observed a general relation existing between these two excretions, and particularly in their relation to food, but the two did not move in parallel lines. My inquiries into the evolution of carbonic acid and urea enable me to show some of their relations, as follows: 1. In both alike the period of production is not identical with that of elimination. Tea and coffee cause a larger elimination of carbon than they supply; and in a paper published in the ' Philosophical Magazine' for December 1859, I showed it to be probable that the immediate action of all food is elimination, whilst the act of production is more remote. Hence carbonic acid may accumulate to a certain point, and be discharged on the application of an efficient cause. So, in like manner, water alone largely eliminates urea; and therefore urea must have accumulated, unless we admit it to be possible that it promotes the production of urea by increasing metamorphosis of tissue. 2. Water has a relation to the elimination of urea analogous to that of air in the elimination of carbonic acid, and an increase of both will equally cause an increase in the elimination. 3. The progression in the rate of hourly excretion of both substances after food is very similar, in so far that the largest excretion follows the breakfast and the tea meals, and the least follows the early dinner; but the proportionate excretion of urea in the middle hours of the day is less than that of carbonic acid. In both the lowest rate occurs in the night. 4. I cannot contrast the effect of season upon these excretions with certainty, since the experiments in reference to carbonic acid were limited to the -excretion in the absence of food and exertion, whilst those on urea extended over the whole day, and comprised the whole influence of food and exertion. Hence these are, perhaps, not parallel conditions. Season lessens the production of carbonic acid before breakfast as the summer advances, and the greatest emission occurs in the spring and winter; but the production of urea with ordinary food and exertion increases with the summer, and is the least in the cold season. 5.. Temperature, as it increases, lessens the production of -carbonic -acid, -and lessens OF UREA AND, URINARY WATER. 825 it in an increasing ratio; and in like manner the action of barometric elevation was inverse; but in reference to urea with food and exertion both relations are direct, and the urea increases as they increase. The effect upon the elimination of carbonic acid was immediate, but upon the excretion of urea it was not usually evident until the following day. 6. Both excretions are influenced by excess of food, as has been shown by the " basis quantities;" but the influence upon urea was much greater than that upon carbonic acid. 7. Exertion influences the excretion of carbonic acid much more than urea. 8. Hence the relation of urea and carbonic acid is one of a general character only. 11. The Relation of Urea to Nutrition. This is associated with both the ingestion and the egestion of nitrogen. The Ingestion of Nitrogen.-The ruling theory in reference to the ingestion of nitrogen is, that the elements of food are absolutely divisible into two classes, and that the nitrogenous are expended in repairing nitrogenous tissues, and the hydrocarbons in supplying heat. But I proved in my former paper on carbonic acid *, on the one hand, that starch and fat, apart from nitrogen, do not increase the emission of carbonic acid (the accepted evidence of the activity of the heat-forming function), and, on the other, that nitrogenous foods do increase the emission of that substance, and are thereby respiratory and heat-forming excitants. It had also been shown by several eminent chemists, that the fattening properties of fodder are in proportion, not to the carbon, but to the nitrogen which it contains; and thence I infer, in accordance with my experiments, that, in the experiments on animals, the fat was due in some way to the nitrogen. It is therefore, I think, impossible to defend this theoretical division of foods, and nitrogen should probably be regarded both as an element of tissue and an excitant of vital actions. Te Excretion of Nitroyen.---LThe views in reference to the excretion of nitrogen are three: 1. That of LIEBIG and his pupils, as BISCHOF'F and VOIT-that the excretion of urea is in proportion to the metamorphosis of tissue, and is as the bulk of the tissue, the nitrogenous fluids contained in the tissue, and the oxygen supplied, or, in other words, as the wants of the tissues, the supply of nitrogenous food, and the activity of the vital processes. They affirm that in every condition in which the elimination of urea is increased there is increased vital action; and the following Table, derived from my own experiments, shows that even the ingestion of fluid on a day of entire abstinence from food causes temporary increase of pulsation.* Philosophical Transactions, 1859. 826 DR. SMITH ON THE ELIMINATION TABLE XLV.-Showing the effect of Water drunk during fasting over pulsation and respiration. Watr Water. Water. Water. Hour. 9 10. 11. 12. 2. 3. 4 5. . 7Th. 10. 10'.

That of BIDDER and SCHMIDT, FRERICHS, and LEHMANN-that the excretion of urea results chiefly from excess of food, and represents "'luxus consumption," and has no necessary relation to tissue action or tissue metamorphosis. This is based upon the fact that with. excess of food, and with certain kinds of food, as gelatine, there is an almost immediate increase in the elimination of nitrogen; and this is abundantly supported by the experiments of LAWES and GILBERT, and by those recorded in this paper. 3. That of LUDWIG and FuHiRER-that urea is due neither to the immediate changes from food nor to changes from tissue, but to the destruction of blood-cells. This view is, I think, of little value, since it simply indicates, in a general manner, that the urea is due to activity of the vital functions. The first view is in accord with LIEBIG'S theory of tile use of nitrogen, and refers essentially to the formation of urea; whilst the second view, regarding the close connexion of excess of food with urea, refers chiefly, or at least in great part, to the elimination, and only by theoretical reasoning to the production of urea; and as the acts of production and elimination are not identical in nature or time, the two sets of views probably do not refer to parallel actions, and may both so far be true. It appears to me that there is much truth in both of these views, and that the difference is very much more one of terms than of things, as I will now endeavour to show. An idea which leads to divergence of opinion in reference to the first view is that connected with tissue-change, representing the tissue as something solid, and quite apart from the circulating mass. But a muscle, besides its tissue framework and perhaps its fat, consists of fluids which are in the closest relation to the circulating fluid, for there is a perpetual interchange proceeding between them; and in reference to nutrition, the fluids in a tissue (and therefore nearly the whole of the soft tissues) are truly parts of the circulatiiig fluid. Another idea, having a similar tendency and connected with the second view, is that which limits the changes proceeding in the blood from food, as if they xvere apart in space, and different in kind from the changes which proceed in the tissues; but the perpetual circulation of the blood through every part of the body, -which is completed evtery few minutes, makes this a distinction almost without a difference, for at every circular tion of the blood it receives from and distributes to every tissue. OF' UREA AND URINARY WATER. 827 If, therefore, we consider the tissue-fluids as a part of the circulating medium, and the products of food as perpetually circulating amongst the tissues. we take away the distinctive peculiarities of these.two views. All experiments have shown (and none more clearly than those of BISCHOFF and VOIT) that there is the closest correspondence between the amount of nitrogen which has entered the blood from food and that excreted as urea in flesh-feeding animals, and that the, former might in these animals really measure the latter. In man and other animals there is a small elimination of nitrogen by other -sources, as certain organic compounds passing off by the skin and lungs, by the uric acid, creatine, and hippuric acid by which the urea in the urine does not fully represent the nitrogen contained in the food which has entered the blood; but, on the whole, as it does not probably exceed 5 grs. of nitrogen in man or its equivalent of about 11 grs. of urea, we need not consider it in the following observations. The prison experiments recorded in this paper, when compared with those on myself, explain the cause of some discrepancies in the results heretofore obtained. In prisoners the urea was lessened on Sundays, when, with no change of food, there was no exertion, and thereby there was relatively an increase of food; whilst in myself there was great increase in the urea, with no exertion and a small increase of food. Two explanations offer themselves:-lst. I am over-fed, so that the full bulk of my tissues is at all times maintained, and therefore I most readily show the effects of increase; but they are rather under-fed, and their tissues have not therefore their full bulk, and hence they appropriate increased food, and do not show the full effects of increase. 2nd. In the absence of the powerful stimulus of violent exertion, the assimilation of food was lessened in the prisoners, and a less proportion of the food was admitted into the blood. Urea is a measure of exertion only so far as it measures food, if the nitrogen of the food be sufficient to maintain the vital actions; but if the tissues lose weight, the excess of nitrogen thus evolved will be added to the urea. If during muscular action there be waste of nitrogen in -the muscle, there will be also appropriation of nitrogen by the same muscle, and the equilibrium will be maintained. If the appropriation proceed pan passm with the waste, there will be as much nitrogen consumedfrom the food as is excreted by the tissue, and the final quantity of urea will be always unchanged; and if the waste should exceed the appropriation during exertion, and appropriation exceed waste in the intervals of rest and at night in the same proportion, the balance will be maintained, and the amount of urea eliminated in the whole twenty-four hours will be unchanged. Hence, with sufficient food, there cannot be any increased elimination of nitrogen from exertion, unless the tissue weight be lessened, and the urea will, de facto, represent the nitrogen taken into the blood with the food. On the other hand, if the bulk of the muscles increase with sufficient food, there will be a-loss in the excretion of nitrogen, because there has been an appropriation of it. Hence the evident relation of urea must be with food, although it may be derived partly from tissue and partly from food; and the precise correspondence in quantity will be regulated by the relation of appropriation to excretion of nitrogen in the tissues. As the urea is derived from various sources, it is impossible that it can measure either tissuewaste or food separately.-M9cccLxJ. 'ST' 828 DR. SMITH ON THE ELIMINATION The true measure of exertion, and therefore, by inference, of tissue-waste also, is the evolution of carbonic acid, which, as I showed in my former paper, is increased immediately, and in a definite and almost proportionate degree by every degree of exertion, whilst no such relation can be traced between exertion and urea. Hence I venture to submit1. That nitrogen is essential to vital transformation as well as to the constitution of certain tissues, and that all in excess of the latter quantity is after a short period cast out of the system. 2. That when the bulk of the tissue is maintained, urea represents nearly all the nitrogen which has entered the blood from the food; when the bulk of the tissue is increased, the urea represents the nitrogen in the food minus the nitrogen gained by the tissues; and when the bulk is lessened, the urea represents the nitrogen supplied by the food plus the nitrogen lost by the tissues; and as in a well-balanced adult system the tissues maintain a standard bulk with some uniformity, the first is the representative condition of urea. 3. That commonly the urea varies as the food. 4. That whilst it is probable that all vital transformations take place in connexion with tissues, it does not follow that vital changes (including the production of urea) do necessarily imply interchange of tissue-elements (solids). 5. The period and amount of elimination of urea is dependent upon the existence of water within the body in excess of that necessary to maintain the due bulk of the tissues and the blood. The urea may therefore accumulate, or, on the other hand, it may be rapidly eliminated. The bulk of the body regulates the emission, but the supply of food and the activity of the vital actions regulate the production of urea. 6. The effect of temperature and atmospheric pressure is probably that of food absolutely or the relation of food to the vital actions in the production of urea, whilst it is that of the statics of the body in relation to the elimination of urinary water and urea. 7. That daily variations are not necessary evidences of variations in the formation of urea. They are lost on a long average by a compensating power, which controls the emission of fluids. Restume. The following is a resume of the principal facts which are contained in the preceding communication:1. The inquiry was intended to show the changes normally proceeding in a healthy and abundantly fed system, under the ordinary and varying conditions under which men live in the course of the year, and also the effect of treadwheel [and other] labour upon prisoners who are well fed, but have no surplus nutritive material in them. -2. The inquiry upon myself was continued during [two years and two months, and embraced 635 days, and more than 1400 analyses for urea.] 3. The average daily evolution of urea was 519 grs. [on the average of two years 500 grs.], and the proportion to each lb. of body-weight was 2 73 grs. The extremes were 298 and [876] grs. daily, and 1P56 to [4-38] grs. per lb. of body-weight. The quantity of between 400 and 500 grs. daily was found in 46 per cent., and between 400 and 600 grs. daily in 85 per cent. of the whole. OF UREA AND URINARY WATER. 829 The weekly averages varied from 428 to 715 grs. daily, and the monthly from 451 to 665 grs. daily. The average daily excretion of urinary water was 53'1 fl. oz. [on the average of two years 51'2 fl. oz.], or *28 fl. oz. to each lb. of body-weight. The extremes were 23'& and 92'67 fl. oz. daily, or '123 to *487 fl. oz. to each lb. of body-weight. The quantities of between 40 and 60 fl. oz. were found in 52-7 per cent. of the observations, but those between 40 and 50, 50 and 60, and 60 and 70 oz. were found respectively in 26'2, 26'5, and 22 4 per cent. Large quantities were always followed, or immediately preceded, by small ones. Daily alternations in quantity were observed. Waves of increase and decrease, or vice versdi, were common; and sometimes there was a progressive increase or decrease, or the quantity remained very high for some days. The daily variations were very great. 4. The relation in the quantity of urea and urinary water varied much; but with increasing decades of ounces of urine there was increasing quantity of urea. The average quantity of urea in 55 oz. of urine passed daily was 9'4 grs. to each ounce; but with 25 oz. it was double that amount per ounce, whilst with an equal quantity in the direction of increase, viz. from 55 to 85 oz. per day, the decrease in the urea per ounce was only 25 per cent. Hence, from a medium standard, the quantity of urea in an ounce of urine decreases much less with increase of urine than it increases with decrease of urine. 5. The average amount of urea per hour, in the twenty-four hours, was 21'7 grs., whilst that of the night was only 16-5 grs., and the basis quantity was 20 3 grs.; but that passed to midday was 25-5 grs. The average of the whole day being the standard, the decrease at night was 24 per cent., and of the "1 basis quantity " 6.4 per cent., whilst the increase to midday was 17-per cent. The greatest number of exceptions occurred with the "' basis quantities ;" so that, the higher the " basis quantity " on the whole average, the greater was the amount of urine evolved on the preceding day. The " basis quantity " cannot be used as a measure of the total quantity of urea on the same day. There were two maxima of elimination of urea and urine, at I P.M. and 9 P.M., after breakfast and tea, (the former being the highest,) and an intervening low period from 2 to 5 o'clock after dinner. In the examination at each quarter of an hour, the maximum emission of 54'6 grs. of urea and 13'S oz. of urine occurred at 123 P.M., three and a quarter hours after breakfast. There was a gradual ascent to, and descent from, the maximum; but during the hour of maximum elimination the increase was proportionately greater, and in one instance was at the rate of 21 oz. per hour. 6. The relations of urinary water to period of the day are similar to those of urea. The average rate of the whole day was 2-21 fl. oz., of the night 1'19 fl. oz., the "1 basis quantity" 2'65 oz., and to midday 4'41. The decrease of the night and the basis quantity from that of the whole day was 46 and 7-2 per cent., and the increase to midday 100 per cent. 5 T2 830 DR. SMITH ON THE ELIMINATION The lines representing the quantity of urea eliminated per hour during the day, and those in each fluid ounce of urine are opposed, and the most so in the morning, but they meet during the night. 7. When, during a fast from food, water is taken at the usual meal-hours during the day, it causes an elimination of urea and urinary water, precisely as if food had been taken, both in degree and progression. There were two maxima after the breakfastand tea-hours, but no increase after the dinner-hour. The maximum was 34-5 grs. of urea, and 11koz. of urine in one hour and a half after having drunk the water at the breakfast period; and the minimum was 5-3 grs. of urea, and 1-36 oz. of urine at 5 P.m., before the tea hour. With water taken at 83, 9a, and 11 A.M., without any food, and the urine passed every quarter of an hour, there was a maximum elimination of urea in three-quarters of an hour after the first and third, and in half an hour after the second dose. The maximum elimination of urine occurred in one hour after the first, and in three-quarters of an hour after the second and third doses. The three maxima were, urea 35-14, 35X22, and 32 grs.; urine 21-6, 21-2, and 19-4 fl. oz. per hour. When 8 oz. of water were taken alone at about 9 A.M., the maximum elimination was in one or one and a half hour; but when 3 oz. of bread, or 2 oz. of gluten bread were added, it did not occur in less than three hours. When tea or coffee were added, it occurred in one and two hours, and in two hours after taking black dose. The maximum increase of urea within three hours from water was from 65 to 104 per cent., but from tea and coffee it was 59 and 58 per cent. The increase in the urine varied from 260 to 640 per cent. with water, 200 per cent. with black dose, and 200 and 350 per cent. with coffee and tea, the " basis quantity " being the standard. 8. 6 oz. of alcohol and water (11to 4-oz.) caused within two hours an increase of urea from 38 to 108 per cent., and of urine from 246 to 554 per cent. The increase of the two was not parallel. 9. With a diet of 34 oz. of bread and 48 oz. of water alone, and then with 300 grs. of tea, and again with 2 oz. of coffee added, the hourly progression was the same as with ordinary food, except that with tea and coffee the maximum elimination was reduced, and the quantity evolved late at night was largely increased; in other words, the elimination of urea was deferred some hours. The maxima of urea were 29 3 grs., 246 grs., and 25 4 grs., with water, tea, and coffee, in their order. The total quantity of urea evolved was 442, 467, and 493 grs. daily, in the same order. 10. The largest average elimination of urea occurred on Sunday, with some increase of food and rest in myself, in whom there is commonly an excess of nutritive material; but the least elimination was then found in the prisoners without change of food and with rest, in whom there is, with a good dietary, a tendency to defect of food; and then also an increased quantity of nitrogen was found in the faeces. In myself the excess of urea was 14A4 grs. when compared with all the days of the year, and 67-9 grs. when compared with 191 days on which there was no known cause of variation. * The daily excretion on Sundays of between 700 and 800 grs. was 3'4, and between 600 and 700 grs. 13-1 per cent. more frequent than on all days combined. The elimination of urea decreased OF UREA AND URINARY WATER. 831 daily to the end of the week, with regular work, from 574 grs. on Sunday, to 460 grs. on Friday; but this varied with the amount of labour and the dependent conditions. 11. The weight of the body after the emission of urine was the greatest on the Sunday, including the Sunday night, and increased from the Saturday from 1 lb. 6 oz. to 2 lb. 3 oz. It decreased progressively during a week of regular labour, but increased on any day with rest. 12. The solid ingesta, on the average of four months, was between 36-L and 37-1 oz. on each week day, but on Sunday it was 41-i oz. The total solid and fluid ingesta were 953 oz. on Sunday, and from 89oz. to 95 oz. on the week days. 13. The quantity of urea eliminated increased in the summer; and, on the average, from May to October inclusive it was 57041 grs., and -from October to April inclusive 480-5 grs. daily. The increase from March to the maximum in August and September was 36 per cent. of the former; and the succeeding decrease to March was 29 per cent. of the maximum. The difference between the maximum and minimum was 46-1 per cent. of the latter. 14. The elimination of urinary water followed the same course, and was 55-7 fl. oz. in the warm, and 51 9 fl. oz. in the cold half of the year. The excess of the maximum over the minimum quantity was 40-2 per cent. of the latter. 15. The elimination of urea increased with increase of temperature and barometric elevation, but it occurred usually on the second day. When the direction of the two influences was different, they neutralized each other. The proportions of urea to one degree of temperature, in the two seasons of the year, were nearly identical, viz. 10-36 grs. in the hot, and 10 9 grs. in the cold season. The months of marked increase and decrease of temperature were those of marked increase and decrease in the elimination of urea. The proportions of urea to one degree of temperature in the two highest and the two lowest months were the same, viz. 11-5 and 11-8 grs. The elimination of urine increased with sudden cold, and decreased with sudden warmth on the same day, and then oscillated to maintain the necessary equilibrium of the fluids in the body. 16. [There are variations in the quantities according to the conditions of each year; but the seasonal-conditions progression remains the same. It is now important to ascertain the influence of the several conditions attending a temporary summer residence at the sea-side, in reference to the increase of urea which then occurs.] 17. With the labour of the treadwheel there was no incriease in the elimination of urea in one hour and ten minutes before breakfast, but an average decrease of 2-4 grs. per hour. There was an increase on the whole day over the day of routine labour of 16 grs., and over the Sundays of 34 grs. per day. The increase of theformer was 3 per cent. The prisoners lifted from 354-81 to 413',89 tons through 1 foot per day, with treadwheel labour. The increase occurred on the treadwheel day alone, except in a few instances, when, with meteorological disturbances, it was deferred to the second dayvin two cases; and then by the necessary alternations the largest excretion occurred on the days of rest, viz, on the alternate days. 832 DR. SMITH ON THE E-LIMINATION 18. The rate of excretion of urea to each lb. of body-weight varied only from 4 39 to 4 74 grs., and was 59 per cent. greater than in myself 19. [The labour of cocoa-matting weaving, as compared with that of tailors, caused the weavers to consume more bread, milk, and water; to lose weight; to emit more urine, urea, chloride of sodium, and feces, and consequently more nitrogen; to exhibit much less diminution in the amount of urea evolved on the Sunday, and a little less urea to body-weight.] 20. The elimination of urea was always increased after additional and unusual food, as at dinner and evening parties; and the increase sometimes continued for some days. The addition of extra fat to the dietary of the prisoners did not vary the amount of urea or urine. Tea, coffee, and alcohol largely decreased the urea on the first and second day, but not on the third day. Tea and coffee did not vary the amount of urine; but alcohol lessened it nearly 20 oz. per day. 21. Chloride of sodium was largely eliminated under the influence of tea, and as largely retained under that of alcohol; and in the latter it corresponded with the reduction of the urine, viz. 27 5 and 28-7 per cent. When 3 oz. of salt was withdrawn frolm the dietary, there was that precise amount deficient in the urine. 22. With headache and stomach-derangement there was commonly lessened excretion of urea, followed by increased excretion on recovery. 23. Urea and carbonic acid accumulate in the system; and the period of production is not that of elimination. Food first causes increased elimination of the stored-up excretion, and then supplies material to be transformed. The hourly rate of excretion of both is very similar with food; but there is no increase of urea after early dinner. The effect of season, temperature, and pressure of the atmosphere is reversed if the total daily emission of urea may be compared with the basal quantities of carbonic acid. 24. The direct relation of urea is with food, and, under certain conditions, varies precisely as the food if the tissue-weight remains unchanged; but when the latter varies, the relation of urea to food will vary in the same proportion. 25. Exertion cannot cause increase of urea over the corresponding quantities of nitrogen contained in the food, unless the muscular bulk be lessened. Commonly the reparation and the waste proceed part passu, or the reparation is in excess during the periods of rest, and restores the equilibrium on a long average. When there is deficient musclebulk, increase of food does not induce a corresponding increase in the urea, but a part is retained by the muscle. The following are the points to which I desire more particularly to direct attention: 1. That every question connected with urea is one of great complexity. 2. That observations made at different hours of the day, and in different seasons of the year, cannot be truthfully compared. 3. That no inquiry less than that involved in the collection of the whole urine evolved in the day can determine the total daily elimination of urea. OF UREA AND URINARY WATER. 833 4. That, as elimination and formation of urea are different acts, but incapable of separation, the influence of agents exerted over the production of urea must be examined on many successive days. 5. As urea is a mixed product from food and tissue, it cannot in any case (even iii prolonged fasting) be taken as an absolute indication relative to the one or the other. 6. As the relations of urea are chiefly with food, and, other things being equal, urea, with the nitrogen in the faeces, will measure the amount of nitrogen contained in the food, its chief value in health and under ordinary conditions is in indicating the amount of food which has entered the blood as distinct from that which has passed through the bowel. In fasting,it will measure nearly the whole of the loss of nitrogen sustained by the tissues, minus an unknown amount which the tissues have received from the albuminous elements of the blood. 7. The relation of urea to weight of body is indefinite and intermediate, since the relation is true only so far as weight of body may represent the consumption of nitrogenous foods. 8. It is probable that the determination of the amount of urea eliminated under the ordinary conditions of life, is much less valuable than is at present supposed. 9. The relation of period of the day to the elimination of urea is that of fluids to the solids in food, and the necessity for fluid in the body, and is one of elimination chiefly, whilst the relation of season of the year and its coexistent circumstances is with the solids in food and the production of urea. 10. The appetite for food, and the amount of nitrogen contained in the food, chiefly affect the production of urea, whilst the statics of the body, and their relation to atmospheric pressure and to temperature, by regulating the quantity of fluid to be retained and emitted, affect the elimination of urea. Certain fluids, and perhaps solids, have the power of retarding the elimination of urea, by causing a retention or accumulation of fluids in the body. 11. The alternations in the quantity of urine emitted on succeeding days are due chiefly to atmospheric influences, acting with, or in opposition to, the statics of the body. 12. The excretion of urea is not affected by purging, except so far as the supply of food may be varied, and fluid be emitted by the kidneys in less quantity than is usual. 13. The relation of urea to such disordered states of the system as are found in derangements of the stomach and in headache is probably less than that of fluid retained; for relief is found rather with the emission of fluid by the bowel or by the kidneys, than with any remarkable and sudden increase in the elimination of urea. 14. The production of carbonic acid is the best measure which we have of the activity of the vital functions attending muscular exertion. 15. The variations in the amount of urine excreted at different seasons of the year are different from what (and not so great as) has been stated, when the amount of fluid drunk is not limited, and the inquiries extend over a lengthened period. 16. It is now most desirable that inquiries should be directed to determine the relative amount of nitrogen in the food which enters the blood to that which remains in 834 ON THE ELIMINATION OF UREA AND URINARY WATER. the bowel. It is probable that this would elucidate many states of disease, and explaill some of the anomalies which still exist as to the relation of urea to food. EXPLANATION OF THE PLATES. PLATE XXXII. Figs. 1 & 2. Examples of alternations and waves in the daily elimination of urinary water. Figs. 3 & 4. The daily quantity of urea, and the amount of urea in each fluid ounce of urine with increasing decades of ounces of urine. Fig. 5. Monthly averages, during two years,; of the daily elimination of urea and urinary water, with the atmospheric temperature and pressure. Fig. 6. Relations of atmospheric temperature to the elimination of urea on the same day and the succeeding day. Fig. 7. Amount of urea excreted on each day of the week. PLATE XXXIII. Daily observations, throughout the year, on the excretion of urea at four periods of the day, compared with the mean daily temperature at Greenwich. PLATE XXXIV. Fig. 1. Hourly elimination of urea and urinary water, and the quantity of urea in each ounce of urine. Fig. 2. Hourly elimination of urea and urinary water at each quarter of an hour. Fig. 3. Hourly elimination of urea and urinary water, and the rate of pulsation during a day of fasting, except from water, which was drunk at four periods of the day. Fig. 4. Daily weight which, with a constant of 13 stones, represented the weight of the naked body. Fig. 5. Hourly elimination of urea and urinary water under the influence of water, tea, coffee, and bread only. Fig. 6. The effect of drinking water before breakfast upon the quantity of urea and urinary water eliminated at each quarter of an hour. Fig. 7. Relation of atmospheric pressure to the elimination of urea on the same day. PLATE XXXV. Urea evolved by four prisoners on days of treadwheel, light labour, and Sundays, compared with the mean daily temperature at Greenwich, with ordinary and special diets. PLATE XXXVI. Contrast of the daily quantities during two years in the elimination of urea and urinary water, and the atmospheric temperature and pressure at Greenlich, with the daily weight of the body during one year.
