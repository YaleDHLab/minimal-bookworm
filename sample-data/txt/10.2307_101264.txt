An Extract of a Letter sent from Danzick, touching some Chymical, Medicinal and Anatomical particulars. Two Letters, written by Dr. John Wallis to the Publisher; One, concerning the Variety of the Annual High-Tides in respect to several places: the other, concerning some Mistakes of a Book entitaled SPECIMINA MATHEMATIC A Francisci Dulaurens, especially touching a certain Probleme, affirm'd to have been proposed by Dr. Wallis to the Mathematicians of all Europe, for a solution. An Account of some Observations concerning the true Time of the Tydes, by Mr. Hen. Philips. An Account of three Books: I. W.SENGWERDIUS PH.D.de Tarantula. II. REGNERI de GRAEF M.D. Epistola de nonnullis circa Partes Genitales Inventis Novis. III. JOHANNIS van HORNE M.D. Observationum ~ circa Partes Genitales in utroque sexu, PRODROMUS. The Squaring of the Hyperbola, by an infinite series of Rational Numbers, together with its Demonstration, by that Eminent Mathematician, the Right Honourable the Lord Viscount Brouncker. WHat the Acute Dr. John Wallis had intimated, some years since, in the Dedication of his Answer to M. Meibomius de ~, vid. That the World one day would learn from the Noble Lord Brounker, the Quadrature of the Hyperbole; the Ingenious Reader may see performed in the subjoyned operation, which its Excellent Author was now pleased to communicate, as followeth in his own words; Zzz Mv (646) My Method for Squaring the Hyperbola is this: LEt A B be one Asymptote of the Hyperbola E d C; and let A E and B C be parallel to th'other: Let also A E be to B C as 2 to I; and let the Parallelogram ABDE equal I. See Fig. 1. And note, that the Letter x every where stands for Multiplication. Supposing the Reader knows, that EA. ~ ~. KH. ~ n. d ~. ~ x ~ ~. ~ ~ CB.&c. are in an Harmonic series, or a series reciproca primanorum seu arithmetice proportionalium (otherwise he is referr'd for satisfaction to the 87, 88, 89, 90, 91, 92, 93, 94, 95, prop. Arithm. Infinitor. Wallisij:) I say A B C d E A = 1/1 ~ 2 + 1/3 ~ 4 + 1/5 ~ 6 + 1/7 ~ 8 + 1/9 ~ 10 &c. E d C D E = 1/2 ~ 3 + 1/4 ~ 5 + 1/6 ~ 7 + 1/8 ~ 9 + 1/10~11 &c. in infinitum. E d C y E = 1/2 ~ 3 ~ 4 + 1/4 ~ 5 ~ 6 + 1/6 ~ 7 ~ 8 + 1/8 ~ 9 ~ 10 &c. For(in Fig.2,& 3)the Parallclog. And (in Fig.4.) the Triangl. CA = 1/1 ~ 2 EdC = 1/2 ~ 3 ~ 4 = ~dD-~dF/2 Note. dD = 1/2 ~ 3 dF = 1/3 ~ 4 Ebd = 1/4 ~ 5 ~ 6 = ~br-~bn/2 1/2CA = dD + dF 1/2dD = br + bn br = 1/4 ~ 5 bn = 1/5 ~ 6 dfC = 1/6 ~ 7 ~ 8 = ~fG-~fk/2 1/2dF = fG + fk fG = 1/6 ~ 7 fk = 1/7 ~ 8 Eab = 1/8 ~ 9 ~ 10 = ~aq-~ap/2 1/2br = aq + ap 1/2bn = cs + cm aq = 1/8 ~ 9 ap = 1/9 ~ 10 bcd = 1/10 ~ 11 ~ 12 = ~cs-~cm/2 1/2fG = et + el cs = 1/10 ~ 11 cm = 1/11 ~ 12 def = 1/12 ~ 13 ~ 14 = ~et-~el/2 1/2fk = gu + gh et = 1/12 ~ 13 el = 1/13 ~ 14 fgC = 1/14 ~ 15 ~ 16 = ~gu-~gh/2 &c. gu = 1/14 ~ 15 gh = 1/15 ~ 16 &c. &c. &c. And (647) And that therefore in the first series half the first term is greater than the sum of the two next, and half this sum of the second and third greater than the sum of the four next, and half the sum of those four greater than the sum of the next eight, &c. in infinitum. For 1/2 dD = br + bn; but bn > fG, therefore 1/2 dD > br + fG, &c. And in the second series half the first term is less then the sum of the two next, and half this sum less then the sum of the four next, &c. in infinitum. That the first series are the even terms, viz. the 2d, 4th, 6th, 8th, 10th, &c. and the second, the odd, viz. the 1st, 3d, 5th, 7th, 9th, &c. of the following series, viz. 1/1 ~ 2. 1/2 ~ 3 1/3 ~ 4. 1/4 ~ 5. 1/5 ~ 6. 1/6 ~ 7. &c. in infinitum = 1. Whereof a being put for the number of terms taken at pleasure, 1/a + a is the last, a/a + 1 is the sum of all those terms from the beginning, and 1/a + 1 the sum of the rest to the end. That 1/4 of the first terme in the third series is less than the sum of the two next, and a quarter of this sum, less than the sum of the four next, and one fourth of this last sum less than the next eight, I thus demonstrate. Let a = the 3d or last number of any term of the first Column, viz. of Divisors, 1/a x a-1 x a-2 = 1/a3 3a2 + 2a = 16a3 48a2 + 56a 24/16a6 96a5 + 232a4 288a3 + 184a2 48a = A 1/2a x 2a-1 x 2a-2 = 1/8a3 12a2 + 4a = 16a3 48a2 + 56a 24/64a6 384a5 + 880a4 960a3 + 496a 96 = B 1/2a-2 x 2a-3 x 2a-4 = 1/8a3 36a2 + 52a-24 64a6 384a5 + 928a4 1152a3 + 736a2 192a/64a6 384a5 + 880a4 96013 + 496a2 96a x 1/4 A < B. And 48a4 192a3 + 240a2 96a = Excess of the Numerator above Denomia. But The affirm. > the Negat. That is, 48a1 + 240a2 > 192a3 + 96 a Because a4 + 5a2 > 4a3 + 2a if a > 2. a2 + 5a > 4a2 + 2 Therefore B > 1/4A. Therefore 1/4 of any number of A: or Terms, is less than their so many respective B. that is, than twice so many of the next Terms. Quod, &c. By (648) By any one of which three Series, it is not hard to calculate, as near as you please, these and the like Hyperbolic spaces, whatever be the Rational Proportion of A E to B C. As for Example, when A E is to B C, as 5 to 4. (whereof the Calculation follows after that where the Proportion is, as 2 to 1. and both by the third Series.) First then when (in Fig. 1.) A E.

For, it has been demonstrated that 1/4 of any terme in the last Columnis less than the terme next after it; and therefore that, of the last terme, at which you stop (649) stop, is less than the remaining terms, and that the total of these is less than 4/3 of a third proportional to the two last. And therefore A B C y E being = 0.75-0.75 and E d C y>0.05685279-and<0.05685290 And A B C d E is<0.69314720and>0.69314709 But when AE.
