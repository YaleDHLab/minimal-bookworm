V>III Qn the Rotatiox of the Plan-et Saturn tSon zts Axis. ay William Hersch-el, LLs D. R A:. S ReadJanuary 23, a 794. iN a late papb er on the multiplicity of the regtl-lar belts of the planet Saturn, I pointed out an analogy, hich tnight lead us to surmlse that it had a pretty qllick rotation upon its axis; T can at present anno-unce the reality of tllat rotation. The following series of observations, in which Saturn has been traced through one hutldred and fifty-four revolutions of its equator, will sufficiently confirm itk The changes in tlae belts of Jupiter, it is well known, are so frequent, that we find some difficulty to make our obserorations of them agree to withila 4, or 5 minutes of time S but the belts on Saturn, wllich I have been lately observingX se.em to hasre undergone no very material change, during the course of the two last months; so that we may hope the period of tlle rotatiotl of this planet, which will be assigned ln this paper, may be looked upon as having a considerable degree of exactness. Before we carl enter into particulars, it will be necessary to give the series of observations upon which my computations harre been founded. ItPis not sufficient to extract only those parts of them which have served for calculating the period; as the value of astrorlomical observations consists in having them entire X every circumstanceS as it occurred, is of conseDr. HERSCHEL S ODSer77aTiOnS, SC49quence) and facts being stubborn things, we cannot decide upon them properly till tlley have been entirely laid open to our viewS and sufficiently scrutinized For this purpose the observations are all extracted from the journal, in theb regular order in which they were made; and 11ere I must remark, that I purposely avoided any calculafions, or even surtnisesS of tlae lengthnof a rotation, while the observations v;ere making; in order to be perfectly free from everybias that might mislead the eye. Irl this I ssucceeded so wYell, that when I began tocalculatey I mistook not less than 4 hours and =, in-the first supposition I made S which, happening to agree extraordinarily well with four of the most pointed observations, it misled me SQ far, that I was very near rejecting the whole series as inconsistent, and began to think the changes in tlle belts to have sbeen so frequent, arld irregular) as not to fall vlnder any kind of calculation. It willS however soon appear tlhat tllis has not beert the case, and that, on the contrary, there has been more steadines$ and regularity in the belts, than might well have been expected in such kind of appeararlces.

These periods leing independent of each otller and the observations having heen made upon diSerent parts of the belt7 agree vertr well together.

In observations previous to the th of Decernbera no particular atten-tion had been given to the minuti of the belts ; but we may suppose themn on the 1 1th of November, to have been considerably distinct and unifornl, to occasion their being noticed d X a-nd this the calculatiorl lrerifies. For the posltion A poirlts out sol degrees, as the situation which was on the Rotation of the Planet Satgrn upon zXts A Xt^5axneridian at the time of observation, and by ftlle figure -we find s-tWto be a very marked place : A strong evidence of the rotation is the position H 1499 ob served Dec. 4 contrasted with the place F 278, which had been viewSed in the early part of the same esrening. The calculation here completely supports the suspicion which is ex pressed in the observation, "that the side which presented 4' itself then was llot the same which had been seen in the be v; ginning of tlae evening." The observatiolas of Dec. 69 are of the most decisive nature; as will clearly appear by viewing the: calculated positions L M N O P Q-R S T, and comparing them with the-descriptions belonging to; tllem, that have been given in the observations. For,---here the revolving helts were successively seen, in all their varioustints, arld the last position T was marked dowr as leaving no doubt of the evident rotation. By the .calcula tion it appears that the belts had moved over g29 degrees, in the course of this evenillg's observation. When the positions c, d, are compared, which were observed Dec. r 6, we see that the southmost belt had acquired an addi-: tional brightness7 as the observation expresses. It may not be amiss to remark upon this occasion, that brightness relates to cleartless, distinctness, and easiness of vision; in opposition to faintness ancl confused outlilles; therefore, the belt being brighter here, denotes its being more strongly marked by a deeper tint of dusliy yellow, and by clearer divisions; so as to be easier perceived. Dec. 19 furnishes a good instance of the exactness of our period ; as the calculated positiong perfectly justifies the surnzise which is expressed irl the observation xacscvw K. 6DA HERSCHEL S observations Sc.Last of all the place y7 being truly pointed out by computa ton fbr Jan*; 16> after a series of an hundred revolution-s since . . the 4th of Pecember, must concur in: supporting our assigned: perlou. I shall only :add one general retnarkv whichis, thatif we lengthen the time of the rotation -but 2 lninutesa it wi11 throw the last observation back above l 16 degrees, and if we diminish it by 2 minutes9 there will arise an excess of more than wl7 and in either case, the calculatiolls and observat-ions would b@ totally atvariance: from which we may conelude that our period must be exact to much less than g minates,,-either way. ; Indeedf what alterations may have taken place in the belts themselvesa it is impossibIe to deterrnine. That there have been some, we may admit7 and rather suppose, but we have no particular reason to suspect them to have been -very considerable. And7 after we have shown that a proper motion, in the spots of the belts, of X 16 degrees one wayv or of 117 the other would only occasion an error of S mnutes in-time, we need not hesltate to fix the rotation of the planet Saturn upon its axis at zoh w6' o",4.
