An Extract of a Letter from a Learned French Gentleman, concerning a way of making Sea-water sweet. -MOnsieur Hauton hath now declared his secret of making Sea water sweet. It consists first in a Precipitation, made with Oyl of Tartar, which he knows to draw with small charges. Next, he distills the Sea water; in which work the Furnace taketh up but little room, and is so made, that with a very little wood or coal he can distill 24 pots of water in a day: For the cooling of which, he hath this new invention, that instead of making the Worm pass through a Vessel full of water (as is the ordinary practise,) he maketh it pass through one hole, made on purpose out of the Ship, and to enter in again through another: So that the Water of the Sea performeth the cooling part: By which means he saveth the room, which the common Refrigerium would take up; as also the labour of changing the Water, when the Worm hath heated it. But then thirdly, he joyns the two precedent Operations, Filtration, there by perfectly to correct the malignity of the Water. This Filtration is made by means of a peculiar Earth, which he mixeth and stirrs with the distilled water, and at length suffers to settle at the bottom. Paris Febr. 22. 1670. An
