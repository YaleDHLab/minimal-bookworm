An Account of the Agitation of the Sea at Antigua, Nov. 1, 1755. By Capt. Affleck of the Advice Man of War. Communicated by Charles Gray, Esq; F. R. S. in a Letter to William Watson, F. R. S. S I R, IN a letter I had from Capt. Affleck, commander of the Advice man of war, dated from Antigua the 3d of January last, are the following paragraphs. `` The year was usher'd in here by the shocks of `` an earthquake, which is the second I have felt at `` this island; neither of which have been violent `` enough to do any damage. On the 1st of No`` vember Read June 3, 1756. [669] `` vember last, I find you had a remarkably sudden `` flux and reflux of the sea at Portsmouth and `` other parts of the coast, which was agitated in `` like manner, at the same time, on the coast of `` America, and all these islands. The tide rose `` here twelve feet perpendicular several times, `` and returned almost immediately: the same at `` Barbadoes. At Martinique, and most of the `` French islands, it overflowed the low land, and `` returned quickly to its former boundaries. The `` people at Barbadoes were never more astonished; `` the rising water in Carlisle Bay appearing as black `` as ink, instead of the clear sea ~green. `` Since I wrote this, I have taken a more par`` ticular account of the flux and reflux above-men`` tioned, from an observing man of this island; `` who remarked, that here it began at half an hour `` after three in afternoon, on the 1st of November `` last; and flowed, every five minutes, five feet per`` pendicular, till as much after six, without any `` violent disturbance on the surface of the water. P. S. In Martinique, in that remarkable flux and `` reflux of the sea, it was in some places dry `` for a mile; and, in others, flowed into the `` upper rooms of the houses and destroyed `` much coffee: At the island of Sabia, it flowed `` twenty-one feet; and at St. Martin's, a sloop, `` that rode at anchor in fifteen feet water, was `` laid dry on her broadside.'' If the Royal Society have not yet had any more particular accounts of this matter from the WestIndies, the above is at their service; and, with my VOL. 49. 4 Q most [670] most respectful compliments to Lord Macclesfield and the rest of the lords and gentlemen, I remain, Sir, Your very obedient Colchester, May ~, 1756. humble servant, Charles Gray.
