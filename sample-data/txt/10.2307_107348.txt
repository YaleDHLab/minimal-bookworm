269 J XVI. Astronomical Observations relating to the Construction of the Heavens, arranged for the Purpose of a critical Examznation, the Result of which appears to throw some new Lzght upon the Organization of the celestial Bodies. By William Herschel, LL.D. F. R. S. Read June 20, 18i1 . A KNOWLEDGE of the construction of the heavens has always been the ultimate object of my observations, and having been many years engaged in applying my forty, twenty, and large ten feet telescopes, on account of their great space-penetrating power to review the most interesting objects discovered in my sweeps, as well as those which had before been communicated to the public in the Connoissance des Temps, for 1784, 1 find that by arranging these objects in a certain successive regular order, they may be viewed in a new light, and, if I am not mistaken, an examination of them will lead to consequences which cannot be indifferent to an inquiring mind. If it should be remarked that in this new arrangement I am not entirely consistent with what I have already in former papers said on the nature of some objects that have come under my observation, I must freely confess that by continuing my sweeps of the heavens my opinion of the arrangement of the stars and their magnitudes, and of some other particulars, has undergone a gradual change; and indeed when the novelty of the subject is considered, we cannot be surprised 270 Dr. HERSCHELLs Astronomical Observations that many things formerly taken for granted, should on exanination prove to be differentt from what they were generally, but incautiously, supposed to be. For instance, an equal scattering of the stars may be adz mitted in certain calculations; but when we examine the milky way, or the closely compressed clusters of stars, of which my catalogues have recorded so many instances, this supposed equality of scattering must be given up. We may also have surmised nebula to be no other than clusters of stars disguised by their very great distance, but a longer experience and better acquaintance with the nature of nebulaE will not allow a general admission of such a principle, although undoubtedly a cluster of stars may assume a nebulous appearance when it is too remote for us to discern the stars of which it is composed. Impressed with an idea that nebule properly speaking were clusters of stars, I used to call the nebulosity of which some were composed, when it was of a certain appearance, resolvable; but when I perceived that additional light, so far from resolving these nebulae into stars seemed to prove that their nebulosity was not different ironm what I had called milky, this conception was set aside as erroneous. In consequence of this, such nebule as afterwards were suspected to consist of stars or in which a few might be seen, were called easily red soltable; but even this expression must be received with caution, because an object may not only contain stars, but also nebulosity not composed of them. It will be necessary to explain the spirit of the method of arranging the observed astronomical objects under considera.. tion in such a manner, that one shall assist us to understand relating to the Construction of the Heavens. 271 the nature and construction of the other. This end I propose to obtain by assorting them into as many classes as wvill be required to produce the most gradual affinity between the individuals contained in any one class with those contained in that which precedes and that which follows it: and it will certainly contribute to the perfection of this method, if this connection between the various classes can be made to appear so clearly as not to admit of a doubt. This consideration will be a sufficient apology for the great number of assortments into which I have thrown the objects under consideration; and it wvill be found that those contained in one article, are so closely allied to those in the next, that there is perhaps not so much difference between them, if I may use the comparison, as there would be in an annual description of the human figure, were it given from the birth of a child till he comes to be a mnan in his prime. The similarity of the objects contained in each class will seldom require the description of more than one of them, and for this purpose, out of the number referred to, the selected one will be that which has been most circumstantially observed; however, those who wish either to review any other of the objects, or to read a short description of them, will find their place in the heavens, or the account of their appearance either in the catalogues I have given of them in the Philos. Trans. or in the Connoissance des Temps for 1784, to which in every article proper references will be given for the objects under consideration. If the description I give should sometimes differ a little from that which belongs to some number referred to, it must be remembered that objects which had been observed many 2b72 lDr. HERSCHEL'S Astronomical Observations' times, could not be so particularly and comprehensively detailed in the confinedspace of the catalogues as I now may describe them ; additional observations have also now and then given me a better view of the objects than I had before. This remark will always apply to the numbers which refer to the Connoissance des Temps; for the nebule and clusters of stars are there so imperfectly described, that my own observation of them with large instruments may well be supposed to differ entirely from what is said of them. But if any astronomer should review them, with such high space-penetratingpowers, as are absolutely required, it will be found that I have classed them very properly. It will be necessary to mention that the nebulous delinea.W tions in the figures are not intended to represent any of the.individuals of the objects which are described otherwise than in the circumstances which are common to the nebula~ of each assortment: the irregularity of a figure, for instance, must stand for every other irregularity and the delineated size for every other size. It will however be seen, that in the figure referred to there is a sufficient resemblance to the described nebula to show the essential features of shape and brightness then under consideration. 1. Of extensive dffused Nebulosity. The first article of my series will begin with extensive diffused nebulosity, which is a phenomenon that hitherto has not been much noticed and can indeed only be perceived by instruments that collect a great quantity of light. Its existence, when some part of it is pointed out by objects that are within the reach of common telescopes, has nevertheless obtruded relaing -to the construction of the Heavens. itself already on the knowledge of astrononmers, as will be seen in my third artitle. The widely diffused nebulosity under consideration has already been partially mentioned in my catalogues. The description of the object I shal select is of No. t i4n Athe 5th class, anld is as follows: "Extremely faint branching " ebulosityits whitishness is entirely of the milky kind, and "it is brighter in three or four places than -in the rest; the s4 stars of the milky way are scattered over it in the same "manner as ove'r the rest of the heavens. Its extent in the parallel is nearly i -degree, and in the meridional direction "; about 5d minutes. The following part of it is divided in-to "several streams and windings, which after separating, meet ." each other again towards the south." See figure 1. This account, which agrees with what will be found in all the other numbers referred to, with regard to the subject uinder consideration, namely, a diffused inilky nebulosity, will give us already somrPe idea of its great abundance in the hear vens; my next article howeveir will far extend our conception of its quantity. 2. Observations of Nebulosities that have not been published before. It may be -easily supposed that in my sweeps of the heavens I was not inattentive to extensive diffusions of nebulosity, which occasionally fell under my observation. They can only be seen when the air is perfectly clear, and when the observer. * See Phil. Trans. for 1 786, page 47 I; for 1789, page :z6 and for I 8oz, page 503. The following ten nebulosities are in the Vth class, No. 13, 14+, 15, 17, 28, 30, 3R, 33, 34, 38.MDCCCXI. N n 274 Dr. HERsCEHL'S Astronomical Observations has been in the dark long enough for the eye to recover from. the impression of having been in the light. I have collected fifty-two such observations), into a table, and have arranged them in the order of right asce-nlon. In the first column they are numbered; in the second and third columns are the right ascension and north polar distance of a place which is the central point of a parallelogram comprehending the space which the nebulosity was observed to fill. They are calculated for the year i8oo. The length and breadth of the parallelograms are set down in the 4th and 5th columns in degrees and minutes of a great circle. The time taken up in the transit of each parallelogram having been properly reduced to space. by the polar distance given in the 3d column, iin order to make it agree with the space contained in the breadth of the zone described by the telescope; the dimensions of the former space therefore is in the parallel, and that of the latter in the meridian. My field of view, being fifteen minutes in diameter, its extent has been properly considered in the assigned dimensions of the parallelograms. It is however evident that the limits of the sweeping zone leave the extent of the nebulosity in the meridian unascertained. The beginning of it is equally uncertain, since the nebulous state of the heavens could only be noticed when its appearance became remarkable enough to attract attention. The ending is always left undetermined; for, as the right ascension was only taken once, I have allowed but a single minute of time for the extent of the nebulosity in that direction, except where the time was repeatedly taken with a view to ascertain how far it -went in the parallel ; or when the circumstances of its brightness pointed out a longer duration. r/tbgto the C~onstruiction of the H-eavens. 275 rThe sixth column of the table contains the size ofth observed nebulosity reduced to square degrees'and decimals, computed fromn the two preceding columns ; and in'the last I have given the account of these nebulosities as recorded in my sweeps at the time they were made;namely within a period of nineteen years, beginning in 1783 and, ending in 1802. When thi's account says affected, it is intended to mean that the ground upon whichi, or through which we see, or may see stars, is affectedI with nebulosity.

Had I been less scrupulous at the time of observation the word suspected would generally have been omitted ; for with this nebulosity, as well as with the great number of nebule that In my catalogues are marked suspected, I have almost without exception found, in a second review, that the entertained suspicion w as. either fully confirmed, or that, without having had any previous notice of the former observation, the same suspicion was renewed when I came to the same placeagain. When these observations are examined with a view to irnprove our knowledge of the construction of the heavens we see in the first place that extensive diffused nebulosity is exceedingly great indeed; for, the account of it, as stated in the table, is asi.7 square degrees; but this, it must be remembered gives us by no means the real limits of it, neither in the parallel nor in the meridian; moreover the dimensions in the table; give only its superficial extent; the depth or third dimensions of it may be far beyond the reach of our telescopes; and when these considerations together are added to what has been said in the foregoing article, it will be evident that the abundance of nebulous matter diffused through such, an expansion of the heavens must exceed all imagination. By nebulous matter I mean to denote that substance, or rather those substances which give out light, whatsoever may be their nature, or of whatever diltt ent powers they may be possessed. Another rem-nark of equal importance arises from the cons sideration of the observed nebdiosities By the account of the table we find that extreme faintless is predominant in most 78 Dr. HERSCHEL'S Astronomical Observations of them; which renders it probable that our best instruments wgill not reach so far into the profundity of space, as to see more distant diffusions of it. In No. 44 of the table, we have an instance of faint milky nebulosity, which, though pretty bright in some places, was completely lost from faintness in others; and No.46 confirms the same remark. It has also been already mentioned in the first article, that the nebulosity in V. I4 was brighter in three or four places than in the rest. The stars also of the milky way which were scattered over it, and were generally very small, appeared with a brilliancy that will admit of no comparison with the dimness of the brightest nebulosity. In consequence of this, wve may already surmnise that the range of the visibility of the nebulous matter ;is confined to very moderate limits. 3. Of Nebulosi/ies joined to Nebuiw. The nature of diffused nebulosity is such that we often see it joined to real nebulae; for instances of this kind we have the fourteen following objects.* The account of the three first nebulve being shortened in the catalogue, I give it here more at length. No. 8i in the first class is " A considerable bright and large nebula. Its nebulosity is of the milky kind, and a small part of it is considerably brighter than the rest. The greatest extent of the milkiness is preceding the bright part, and "4 the termination of it is imperceptible." To No. 207 should be added" It seems to join to imperceptible nebulosity on the " south preceding side ;" and to No. 214, "' It terminates* See I. Si, 207, 214. IV. 41. V. n2I , 7, 44, 51, 52. Connoissance des Temps 37, 42, 64, 78. relating to the Construction of the 1leavens. 279 "abruptly to the north and is diffused to the south.') See Fig. 2. NTO. 42 of the C~onnoissance is the great nebula in the constellation of Orion discovered by HUYGHENS. 'This highly interesting object engaged my attention already in the begirnning of the year 1774, when viewing it with a NEWTONIAN reflector I made a drawing of it, to which I shall have occasion hereafter to refer; and having from time to time reviewed it with my large instruments, it may easily be supposed that it was the very first object to which, in February 1787, I directed my forty feet telescope. The superior light of this -instrument shewed it of such a magnitude and brilliancy that,j udging from these circumstances, we can hardly have a doubt of its being the nearest of all the nebulx, in the heavens, and as such will afford us many valuable informations. I shall however now only notice that I have placed it in the present order because it connects in one object the brightest and faintest of all nebu-losities, and thereby enables us to draw several conclusions from its various appearance. Thle first is that the extensive diffused nebulosities contained) in the objects of the preceding articles are of the same nature with the nebulosity in this great nebula; for when we pursue it in its extensive course it assumes precisely the same I appearance as the before-mentioned diffused nebulosities. The second consequence we may draw from the circumstance of its containing both the brightest and faintest nebulosity joined in one object is a confirmation of an opinions already conceived in the second article, namely, that the ranges of the visibility of nebulous matter is what may be called very limited. The depth of the nebula may undoubtedly be exn 2.8O Dr. HERSCHEL'S Astrono7 ical -Observations ceedingly great, but when we consider that its greatest brights ness does not equal that of small telescopic stars, as may be seen by comparing four of them situated within the inclosed darkness of the nebula, and several within its brightest aps pearance, with the intensity of the nebulous light; it canhot be expected that such nebUlosities will remain visible when exceedingly farther from us than this prime nebula: the ratio of the known decrease of light will not admit of a great range of visibility within the narrow limits whereby this shining substance can affect the eye. From this argument a secondary conclusion may be drawn, which adds to what has already been said in the foregoing article, namely, that if our best telescopes cannot be expected to reach the nebulous matter, which by analogy we may suppose to be lodged among the very small stars plainly to be seen by them the actual quantity of its diffusion may still farther exceed even the vast abundance of it already proved to exist. A nebulous matter, diffused in such exuberance throughout the regions of space, must surely draw our attention to the purpose for which it probably may exist; and it must be the business of a critical inquirer to attend to all the appearances under which it will be exposed to his view in the. following observations. 4. Of detached Nebulosities. The nebulosities of the preceding articles are not restricted to an extensive diffusion; we meet with them equally in detached collections I shall only mention the following six.* V. 2_1 consists of " A broad faint nebulosity extended in the * See I. 92. V. 21, z6, 36, 41, 42. relating to the Construction of the Heavens. 281 form of a parallelogram with a short ray from the precede Aing corner towards the south. The nebulosity is nearly of an equal brightness throughout the parallelogram, which is 'about 8' long and s or 6' broad,+ but ill defined." See fig. a, a, be, C. j. Of milky Nebulea When detached nebulosities are smiall we are used to call them nebulx, and it is already known from my catalogues that their number is very great. It will therefore be sufficient to refer only to a few, of which the nebulosity is of the milky kind. No. 9 in the 5th class is "c A large, extended, broad, faint nebula; its nebulosity, like that of the preceding one (which 'is DE LA CAILLE'S last but one in the Catalogue des Nebu"leuses du Ciel Australt) is of the milky kind."' The only purpose for which the nebulae of these two classes have been placed in this connection, is to show that large de. tached nebulosities, whatevter may be their appearance, as well as those nebulae expressly called milky, partake of the general nature of the diffused nebulous matter, pointed out in the preceding articles. 6. Of milky Nebulx with Condensation. In looking at the beautiful nebula in Orion; to which I refer, because every common good telescope will shew it sufficiently well for the present purpose; we perceive that it is not equally bright in all its parts, butz that its light is more* See I. zo{, III. i, ix6. IV. 7, 2o, 30. V. 9, 25. I See Connoissance des Temps for 1784, page 27z.MDCCCXI 0 o 282 Dr. HERSCHEL'S, Astronomical Observatzions condensed in some places than in others. The idea of con,-densation occursso naturally to us when we see a gradual' increase of light, that we can hardly find a more intelligible mode of expressing ourselves than by calling it condensed. The numerous instances that will be given hereafter of nebulae that have this kind of condensation, renders it unnecessary to ,refer to more'than thbe following four.* The first of these, No.X1 in the first class, is " A bright CC nebula of some extent, although! jnot very large. It is-of an "irregular figure, and the greatest brightness lies towards"' the middle. The whitishness of this nebula is of the milky kind'." See figure 4. By attending to the circumstances of the size and figure of' this nebula, we find that we can account for its greater brights ness towards the middle in the most simple manner by supposing the 'nebulous matter ofwhicch it is} composed to fill ain-. irregular kind of solid' space, and that-it is either a' little deeperi in the brightest place, or that thenebulosity is perhaps a little more compressed. It is not necessary for us to determine at' present to which of these causes the increase of brightness may be owin]g,; at all events it cannot be probable that the" nebulous matter should have different powers of shining such. as would be required, independent of depth or compression. 7. Of Nebula' which are brighter in more than one Place, It is not an uncommon circumstance that the same nebula" is brighter in several different places than in the rest of its compass.l The following six are of this sort. t * See I. I ,84.. 111. 457. IVT, I. f SeelI. -65, zi3, z6i. Il Z97, 406. III. 49. relatzng to the Constructozai of the Heavens. 08,8 No. 2;13s in the first class is " A very brilliant and consider'ably large nebula, extended in a direction from south pre"ceding to north following. It seems to have three or four bright nuclei." See fig. A. From this -construction of the nebula, we may draw some additional information concerning the point which was left undetermined in my last article; for since there it was pro*V posed as an alternative, that the nebulous matter might either be of a greater depth or more compressed in the brightest part of the nebula -then under conlsideration, we have now an opportunity to examine the probability of each case. If herethe appearance of several bright nuclei is to be explained by the depth of the, nebulous matter, we must have recourse to three or four separate very slender and deep projections, all situated exactly in the line of sight; but such a very uncom. mon arrangement of nebulous mnatter cannot pretend to pro-, bability; whereas a moderate condensation, which may indeed be also accompanied with some little general swelling of the nebulous matter about the places which appear like nuclei, will satisfactorily account for their superior brightness. The same method of reasoning may be as successfully ape -plied to explain the number of unequally bright places in the diffused nebulosities which have been described in the ist, 2d, and 3d articles. For instance, in the branching nebulosity V. 14, we find three or four places brighter than the rest-in the nebulosity No. 44 of the table we hlave places of different brightness. In ,the nebula of Orion, there are many parts that differ much in hlLstre; and in V. 37 of the same article I forund, by an observation in the year 1790, the same variety of appearance. In all these cases a -proportional condensation 0 2 284 Dr HERSCHEL'S Astronomical Observations of the nebulous matter in the brighter places will sufficiently account for their different degree of shining. This way of explaining the observed appearances being admitted, it will be proper to enter into an examination of the probable cause of the condensation of the nebulous matter. Should the necessity for such a condensing cause be thought to be admitted upon too slight an induction, a more detailed support of it will hereafter be found in the condition of such a copious collection of objects, as will establish its existencebeyond all possibility of doubt.* Instead of inquiring after the nature of the cause of the condensation of nebulous matter, it would indeed be sufficient for the present purpose to call it merely a condensing printW ciple; but since we are already acquainted with the centripetal force of attraction which gives a globular figure to planets, keeps them from flying out of their orbits in tangents, and -makes one star revolve around another, why should we not look up to the universal gravitation of matter asthe cause of every condensation, accumulation, compression, and concentrationof the nebulous matter? Facts are not wanting to prove that such a power has been exerted; and as I shall point out a series of phenomena in the heavens where astronomers may read in legible characters the manifest vestiges of such an exertion, I need not hesitate to proceed in a few additional remarks on the consequences that must arise from the admission of this attractive principle. The nebula, for instance, which has been described at the beginning of this article, as containing several bright nuclei has probably so many predominant seats of attraction, arising $ See Article 24. relating to the Construction of the Heavens. 285 from a superior preponderance of the nebulous matter in those places; but attraction being a principle which never ceases to act, the consequence of its continual exertion upon this nebula will probably be a division of it, from which will arise three or four distinct nebulr. In the same manner its operation on the diffused nebulosities that have many different bright places, will possibly occasion a breaking up of them into smaller diffusions and detached nebula; but before I proceed with conjectures, let us see what observations we have to give countenance to such expectations. 8. Of double Nebule with joined Nebulosity. In addition to the instances referred to in the preceding article, of nebulae that have more than one centre of attraction I give the following list of what may be called double nebulae.* The 3i6th nebula in the second class to which in the catalogue is joined the 317th, consists of " two small faint nebulae <I of an equal size within i.' of each other. Each has a seemis ing nucleus, and their apparent nebulosities run into each "c other. Their relative position is in a direction from south 9' preceding to north following." See fig. 6, a and b. Each of the fifteen objects referred to contains two nuclei or centers of attraction, and if the active' principle of condensation carries on its operation, a division of their at present united nebulosities must, in the end, be the consequence.

For although the nebulosities of figure b, swhen seen in the direc tion of the dotted lines will appear to run together, they may nevertheless be at some small distance from each other; but the same cause which will bring on a separation of it in figure a will also make two distinct nebula of figure b. "With regard to their being double nebula, it may be oWo jected that this double appearance maybe a deception; and indeed if this were a double star, instead of a double nebula, there might be some room for such a surmise. But on two accounts the case is very different. In the first place, we have not nebulae without-number at all. distancesto which we might have recourse, in supposing one <to tbe far behind the other, as we have stars behind stars to produce an appearance of their being double. In the next.; if what has been said of the confined range -of the visibility of the nebulous matter be recollected, especially where it is so faint as in the double nebula which has been described, we cannot harbour an idea that the two objects of which it is composed are very far asunder. Add to this their great resemblance in size, in faintness, in nucleus, and in their nebulous appearance; from all which I believe it must be evident that their nebulosity has originally belonged to one common stock. 9.

To add to the probability of the separation of nebulae, we ought to have a considerable number of them already separelating to the Construction of the Heavens. 287 rated. The following twenty three are completely divided although not more than two minutes from one another.* A description of II. 714 is c; Two pretty bright nebulax; they are both round, small, and about a' from each other, ,'"in a meridional direction." Of III. 755 is " Two very faint, very small extended new "bulae within i-' frome each other." That all these nebula are really double, is founded on the reason already assignedin the--last article. Then if we would enter into some kind of examination how they came to bee arranged into their binary order, we cannothave recourse to a promiscuous scattering; whichl by a calculation of chances can never account for such a peculiar distribution of them. If, on the contrary, welook to a division of nebulous matter by the condensing principle, then every parcel of it? which had m ore than one preponderating seat of attraction in its extent, must in the progress of tiine have been divided. No doubt can be suggested on account of the great lengths of time such a division must have taken up, when we have anm. eternity of. past duration to recur to, io.

The following ioi double nebula referred to will confirm this statement.* No. 36 and 37 in the first class are cc Two small bright "nebulae, both a little extended." No. 74 and 75 in the second class are " Two pretty bright "nebula; the preceding of them is almost round; the fol"lowing very much extended in length; they are not far " from the same parallel, and about 8 or lo' distant from each "' other." No. 127 and 128 in the third class are "Two extremely "faint nebula, about 3' from each other, and nearly in the A same parallel. The second is a very little brighter than the c; first, and is of an irregular round figure." It is remarkable that in the description of all these moi nebulae, there are not more than five or six which differ so much in brightness from one another, that we could suppose them to be at any considerable different distance from us; and equal brightness or faintness runs through them all in general; but supposing that any two nebula should even differ as much from one another, as the set of the first class which has been described, is different from the faintness of the last described set, yet this would not nearly amount to the difference in the brightness of one part of the nebula in Orion from that of another of the same nebula. * See I. 28, 36, 90, 145.

If it was supposed that double nebule at some distance from each other would frequently be seen, it will now on the contrary be admitted that an expectation of finding a great numnber of attracting centers in a nebulosity of no great extent is not so, probable; and accordingly observation has, shewn that greater combinations of nebulae than those of the foregoing article are less: frequently to be seen. The followlist however contains 2o treble, 5 quadruple, and i sextuple" niebuke of this sort,* Among the treble nebula@ there is one, namely V. 10, of which the nebulosity is not yetseparated. ; Three nebuke seem to join faintly together, forming a kind of triangle;' themiddle of which isR less nebulous, or perhaps free from "nebulosity; in the middle of the triangle is a; double star of the 2-d ord class; more faint nebulosities are following."

P p A9O Dr. HiERScHEL'S Astronoind al Observatizg Of the rvemfarkable Situation of Nebula. The number of compound nebula thathave been noticed in the foregoing three articles being so considerable it Will, follow, that if they owe their origin to the breaking up of some former extensive nebulosities of the same nature with. those vhich have been shewn to exist at present, we might expect that the number of separate nebula should far exceed the former, and that moreover these scattered nebule should be found not only in great abundance, but also in proximity or continuity with each other, according to the different extents. and situations of the former diffusions of such nebulous matter.. Now this is exactly what by observation, we find to be the. state of the heavens. In the following seven assortmentswe have not less than. 424 nebula ; some of them of unascertained size, figure, or -condensation and the rest with only the first of these three. essential features recorded. The reason for not having a more circumstantial account of such a number of objects, is that they crowded upon me at the. time of sweeping in such quick succession, that of sixtyvone I could but just secure the place in the heavens, and of the. remaining three hundred and sixty-three, I had only time to add the relative size.** See sixty-one nebula.

To -refer astronomers to the heavensfor an inspection of these and the following nebulhe would be to propose a repetiP tion-of more than eleven hundred sweeps to them, but those ,who wish to have some idea of the nebulous arrangements may consult Mr. BODE's excellent Atlas Coelestis. A suiccesE sion of places where the nebulx of my catalogues are uncouth monly crowded, will there be seen beginning over the tail of Hydra and proceeding to the southern wing, the body andi the northern wing of Virgo, Plate 14. Then to Coma Berez -nices, Canes venatici, and the preceding armof Bootes, Plate 7. A different branch goes from, Coma Berenices tothe hind legs of Ursa major. Another branch passes from the wing of Virgo to the tail and body of Leo, Plate S. It will not be necessary to point out many other smaller collections which. may be found. in several plates of the same Atlas. On the other hand, a very different aspect of the heaven&s will be perceived, whenweexamine the following constellate. tions. Beginning from the head of Capricorn, Plate 16, thence proceeding to Antinous, to the tail of Aquila, Plate 9, to Ramus 'Cerberuss, and the body of Hercules, Plate 8, to Quadrans Muralis, Plate 7, and to the head of Draco, Plate S. We may also examine the constellations of Auriga, Lynx, and Came-n lopardalus, Plate 5. In this second review, it will be found that here the absence, of nebuke is as remarkable, as the great multitude of them in. the first mentioned series of constellations.. relating to thze Construction of the Heavens. 13. Of very narrow long Nebul. in order to advance in our knowledge of the condition of the nebulous matter, we may investigate the form of its expansion by the figure of the nebula that have been observed. The following five are particular instances of some that were much extended in length, but very little in breadth.* No. 254 in the 3d class is "d A very faint nebula, extended " from north-preceding to south-following It is about "long and less than + minute broad." See fig. 7. The expansion of the nebulous matter in general may be considered as consisting of three dimensions; these may all be ether nearly equal, or one of them may be much less than the other two; or the extent of two of them may be very inferior to that of the third. The nebula which have now been referred to exclude a nebulosity of three nearly equal dimensions, which can never be seen under less than two of them.. When two of the dimensions of the nebulous matter are nearly equal, one of themmay indeed bA only visible;v but then the chance that the other should be exactly parallel, to the line of sight, is by no means favourable. The most plausible way of accounting. for the apparent figure of these nebule is, therefore, to admit that the expansion of the nebulosity consists indeed of a very narrow length, and not much depth. This form when ascribed to nebulous matter, is sufficiently uncommon, for us to expect to see many nebulae of the figure of extended, rays. * See I. ;3, zo6. III. ZS+4 IV. 72.

The considerable breadth of these nebula, although chiefly extended in length, proves that two of the dimensions of the nebulous matter,. namely, the breadth and depth, are probably not very different;t for if the depth, which is the dimension we do not see, should be equal to the length, the chance of its being out of sight is not sufficiently probable to happen. very frequently. It is therefore to be supposed that the extension in length is really the greatest ; for as we actually see it under this form, we are assured that it is at least as long as it appears, whereas once of the other dimensions, if not both,, must certainly be less than the length. This kind of expansion admits. of the utmost variety of lengthened form and position; and from the greatnumber of nebula to which I have referred, the existence of such. nebulosities is fairly to be deduced. 15.

II. 2-89 is.," A faint pretty large nebula ; it is of an irregular "triangular figure." By calling the figure of a nebula irregular, it must be uns derstood that I saw no particular dimension of it sufficiently marked to deserve the name of length; for, had there been such a distinction, its extension in the longitudinal direction would have been recorded, or, as it frequently happened, for want of time, the nebula would shortly have been called -extended. From this consideration it follows, that the nebulous matter which assumes an irregular figure when seen in a telesu cope, cannot be very different in two of its dimensions; and this leaving the third entirely undetermined, it may be of greater" equal, or less extent than either of the other two. But to be greater or less than the dimensions that were seen it would require the particular situation of the third dimension in either' case to be in the direction of the line of sight, which is so far at least improbable, that wve may fairly suppose the unseen dimension not to differ much from either of the former two. G6. Of Nebulc that are of an irregular round Figure. Theapparent figure of the; nebula, contained in the fore-M going articles has already assisted me. in a great measure to assign the expanded formn of the nebulous matter of which they consist. The irregular round appearance of the follows ing fifty five nebula however, being of a much more marked description than the former,. will lead to more decisive con' clusions. I have divided themn, into three assortments.*See twenty-eigbt nebulx of an irregular round figure of various small sizes. I. relating to the Construction of the Heavens. S97 No. 177 in the third class is "f A very faint nebula of an "irregular round figure, about 2 or 3 minutes in diameter." See fig. 10. The appearance of an irregular round figure necessarily requires that the extent of tvo dimensions of the nebulous matter should be nearly equal in every direction, at right angles to each other. The unseen dimensions may certainly be longer or shorter than the visible irregular diameter; but then it must be absolutely extended centrally in. the line of sight, which is a condition that has no probability in its favour; and the greater the number is, of such nebula, the less is the, probability that the form of the nebulous matter should be irregularly cylindrical, or conical. For, except an irregular cylinder or cone, placed 'in the particular required situation, no expansion of the nebulous matter but an irregular globular one can be the cause of the irregular round figure of the above-mentioned nebula. Then since the irregular globular form has this advantage above the cylindrical and conical f9gure, that it will answer the required end its any situation whatsover, it is certainly that which ought to be admitted as the cause of the observed appearance. This method of reasoning upon the form of the nebulous matter from the observed figure of nebull, will lead us a step farther than it might have been supposed. For granting it to23.

HERSCHEL'S Astroomial Observations be highly probable, that ;the appearance of irregular round nebulw are owing to so inany irregular globular expansion& of nebulous matter, it will be necessary to direct our attentior to the cause which has formed this matter into such masses To ascribe an highly improbable event to chance is not philo.. losophical; especially as a forming cause offers itself -to our view, when we direct an eye to the globular figure of the planets and satellites of the solar system. 17. Of round Nebuiw. From what has been said, it appears thaat the figo-ure of nebulw is a subject of more interest than mere cuLriosity. The following fifty-seven were observed to be round, and I give them here in four assortments.. As the title of each sort gives all that is necessary for the present purpose relating to the various sizes of round nebule, a description of one of the last will be sufficient. The observvation of I. 269 says, that it is "1 A considerably bright round nebula of about one minute in diameter."

In tthe last article I have only directed our attelition tothe cause of thisvery particular construction, but from the obser. vations of the l nebulo above referred to, we may now more confidently assign the attraction of gravitation a.s thire principle which has drawt the nebulous matter towards a center, and collected it into a:,spherical cormpSss. I have already shewnl that the same principle appears to be the cause of the condensationv of the nebulous matter in the bright places off nebule; that shine with. unequal degrees of light in the diferenit parts of their extent,*g and a concurrence of argumzentsi establisled uponl very different fo4ndations cannot fail to give aadditionlal weigrit to the reasonings by which.z they are supoprted. 8.

The inequally of its brightness in different parts may arise from unequal condensation or from greater depth of nebulous natter. II. 313 is "e A pretty bright nebula, a little extended in tbe "parallel. The greatest brightness is towards the following "side, which is also the broadest; the preceding part being " more like a ray proceeding from it." The irregular figure of these latter kind of nebulae may be admitted to arise from the as yet imperfect concentration of a nebulous mass, in which the preponderating matter of it is not in the center. 19. Of Nebula that are gradually a little brighter iD the middle. The investigation of the form of the nebulous matter in the 13, 14, Ad, and i6th articles has been founded only upon the observed figure of nebuIal; and in the 17th article the globular formn of this matter deduced from the round appearance of nebulo, has been ascribed to the action of the gravitating principle.

It is hardly necessary to say that the united testimony of. so many objects can leave no doubt about the central seat of' attraction, which; in every instance of figure is pointed out to be in thie iriddle, The only remark I have to make, relates to the exertion of the condensing power, which in the case of these niebulke appears to have producedbut a ver moderate effect. This may be ascribed either to thle unsha pen mass of nebulus matter which would require much time before it couldcome to . somecentral arrangement of form either in length, or in length and. breadths, oir lastly in all its three dimensions. It may also be ascribed to the small quantity of the preponderating central> attractive matter; or even to the shortness of its time of acting: for in this case millions of years, perhaps> are but moments.. 20. Of Nebule which are gradually brzghter in the middle, By the general description of a nebula, when it is said to be gradually brighter in the middle,s we are to understand that its-light was observed to be obviously brighter about the centersi than in othie r parts.

From the account of these nebule, we find again that all what has been said concerning the seat of the forming and condensing power of the nebulous matter, isabundantly confirmed by observation. I have only to remark that, the exertion of the gravitating principle in these nebula, is in a more advanced state than with those of the last article; and that the same conceptions w hich have already been suggested, namely, the original form of the nebulous matter; its quantity in the seat of the attracting principle; and the length of the time of its action when properly considered, will sufficiently account for the present state of these nebulax 21.

Of Nebule that have a Cometic appearance. Among the numerous nebulal I have seen, there are many that have the appearance of telescopic comets. The following are of that sort.* Le 4 is "1 A pretty large cometic nebula of considerable brightness; it is much brighter in the middle, and the very fifaint chevelure is pretty extensive." Fig. 22. By the appellation of cometic, it was my intention to express a gradual and strong increase of brightness towards the center of a nebulous object of a rou'nd figure; having also a faint chevelure or coma of some extent, beyond the faintest part of the light, gradually decreasing from the center. It seems that this species of nebulae contains a somewhat greater degree of condensation than that of the round nebula of the last article, and might perhaps not very improperly have been included in their number. Their great resemblance to telescopic comets, however, is very apt to suggest the idea, that possibly such small telescopic comets as often visit our neighbourhood may be composed of nebulous matter, or may in fact be such highly condensed nebulae.* See Seventeen cometic nebulhe.

A nucleus, to which these nebula seem to approach, is an indication of consolidation ; and should we have reason to conclude that a solid body can be formed of condensed nebulous matter, the nature of which has hitherto been chiefly deduced from its shining quality, we may possibly be able to view it with respect to some other of its properties. O Of round Nebulx iicreasing gradually in brit'hmness up to ac .Nucleus in the middle. It has already been proved, from the figure and central brightness of round nebula, that the nebulous matter of which they consist must be admitted to be of a globula'r forr; but the following thirteen nebulae lead me to a remark which not only applies to them, but to all the round nebula of tode last five articles, which added to theese amroun, to to cthree hundred and twenty tone, They are not only round, but the gradual condensation' from the circumfererce to the very center being, of equal density of Pight at equal central distances, every ring or circle drawnk round the center, bears witness to the exist; ence of a centeral attraction. For xhatever may be t le intensity or ratio of the conce ntrationr at av iven central distal-ce, it follows, fron the couality of brAhJ1nes& at the assign ed distance, that no figue but a Krobutar one can with any kind of probability exj-ian the appearancc at-Aid that the concentration1 as well as the fiure is produced by a general gravitatiof of th enbulous, matter.* eSe Is 2, 6,o 132, 151, 173, 236, 7 I 8 5?, 9 716 64. 8 l6 5I8.

Fig. 26. Fromn the description of these nebulas, we find that an actual nucleus has been formed in the attracting center.; and that consequently a certain degree of consolidation of the nebulous matter is highly probable; for, although the quality of shining only points out the existence of something that is luluminous, yet from analogy we heave reason to conclude that certain material substances must be present to produce the light wve perceive; a nd that they must be opaque, may be inferred fromn every thing we -know about shining substances. -e5.

The nuclei of these nebulae, after what has been proved, o-f the existence of a condensing power, I need not hesitate to ascribe to the longer continuance of its action, which appears to bring on a consolidation; and that this may be the consequence we may conclude, not only from the power of cont densing, which argues a sufficient quantity of matter, but also from the quality of shining ; for this proves that the substanCe which throws out the nebulous light is endowed with some other of the general qualities of matter besides that of gravitation. A second remark I have to make is, that the opaque nature of the nebulous matter whilch was before inferred from analogy, is here supported by observation; for these consolidated nuclei have a considerable resemblance to the disks of planets; and if this matter consisted only of a luminous substance, the increase of light would probably far exceed their observed lustre : this being the case, the power of arresting light in its passage is an additional quality, very different fromn those which have already been mentioned, and seems to be analo. gous to properties which we know to belong to hard andc solid bodies. 26. Of extended NebuIw that shew the Progress of Condensatlon. When the nebulous matter is much extended in length, it' appears from the following nebula, that with those which relating to the Construction of the Heavens. S1.1 have a nucleus completely formed, the nebulosity on each side of it is comparatively reduced to a fainter state than it is in nebulae of which the nucleus is apparently still in an incipient state. These faint opposite appendages to the nucleus I have in my observations called branches. In some nebulke there is also an additional small faint nebulosity of a circuLlar form about the nucleus, and this I have called the chevelure. The following two assortments contain twenty-eight nebula of this kind.* Number 65 of the Connoissance is " A very brilliant nebula c extended in the meridian, about 12' long. It has a bright nucleus, the light of which suddenly diminishes on its border, and two opposite very faint branches." Fig. 29. I. 2o, is cc A very brilliant nebula, 5' or 6' long and 3 or 4' broad; it has a small bright nucleus with a faint chevelure "about it, and two opposite very extensive branches. Fig 3o. The construction of these nebiilah is certainly complicated and mysterious, and in our present state of kowledge it would be presumptuous to attempt an explanation of it; we can only form a few distant surmises, which however may lead to thn following queries. May not the faintness of the branches arise from a gradual diminution, of the length and density of the nebulous matter contained in them, occasioned by its gravitation towards the nucleus into which it probably subsides ? Are not these faint nebulous branches joining to a nucleus, upon an immense scale, somewhat like what the zodiacal light is to our sun in miniature? Does not the chevelure* See Twentythree extended nebulce witb a nucleus and two opposite faint brancbes.

The chev elure of these nebltaia consists probably of the rarest nebulous matter, which not having as yet been consolidated with the rest, remains expanded about the nucleus in the shape of a very extended atmosphere; or it may be of an elastic nature, and be kep t from uniting with the nucleus, as their elasticity causes the atmospheres of the planets to be ex" panded about them. In this case we heave another property of the nebulous subst nce to add to the former qualities of its matter. With those nebulze where this clhevelure is uncommonly faint, and the nucleus very bright, the consolidation appears to have reached a still higlher degree, and their resemblance to nebulous stars may lead to very i-tresting consequences. 08.

From the size of the nebulae as we see them at present, we anLmot form an idea of the original bulk of the nebulous matter t1hey contain; but let us admit, for the sake of computation, that Im-e nebulosity of the above described nebula IV. Ad, when it wCas in a state of diffusion, took up a space of lo' in every cubical direction of its expansion; then, as we now see it collected into a globt lar compass ofa less than one minute, it must of course be more than nineteen hundred times denser than it was in its original state. This proportion of density is more, than double that of water to air. With regard to planetary disks, which have bright central points, we may surmise that their original diTfiseed nebulosity was more unequally scattered, and that they passed throughi the different stages of extended nebulae, gradually acquiring a nucleus, chevelure, and branches. For innebula of this construction, theconsolidation of a nucleus is already munch advanced at the time when a considerable quantity of nebulous --matter, on account of its greater central distance, remains still vtnforn ed in the branches; and if the condensation of the ni1eUs shoutd keep the lead, it will come to a stat e of great solidity and v imum of brightness by the time that the rest of tile nob ulosity is drawn into a planetary apt pearanc-e. rhelatgzng to the Construction of the Heavens. 317 30. Of Planetary Nebulee. T1he objects -of which I shall give an account in this article have so near a resemblance to planets, that the name of 'lanetary nebule very justly expresses their appearance; for notwvithlstanding their' planetary aspect, some small remaining haziness, by which they still are more or less surrounded, evinces their nebulous origin. In my catalogues the places of the following ten have been given.* IV. 1 8 is "1 A beautiful brighit round nebula, having a pretty "well defined planetary disk of about lo or 12" in diameter. It is a little elliptical, and has a very small star following,. which gives us the idea of a smnall satellite accompanying "its planet. It is visible in a common finder as a small star." Fig. 36.

The remarks which have b2ein made on the nebuhe of the foregoig article will Iere applY with additional propriety; fbr the light of these planetary nebule must be considerably more condensed than that of the foregoing sets.

T. Of the Distance of the ANebuTla in the Constellation of Or/ott, In my 3d article I concluded, from the appearance of the great nebula in Orion, that the range of the visibility of tbe diffused nebulous matter cannot be great, because we may there see in one and the satne object, both thebrightest and faintest appcarance of nebulosities that can be seen any where, it will therefore be a case of some interest, if we can form any conception of the place among the fixed stars to which we ought to refer the situation of this nebula; and this I believe mny observation of it will enable us to determine pretty nearly In the year 1774, the 4thof March, I observed the nebulous star, which is the 43d of the Connozssance des Temps, and is not many minutes north of the great nebula; but at the same time I also took notice of two similar, but much smaller new bulous stars; one on each side of the large one, and at nearly equal distances from it. Fig. 37 is a copy of a drawing which was made at the time of observation. In 1783, 1 examined the nebulous star, and found it to be fain-tly surrounded with a circular glory of whitish nebulosityp faintly joining to the great nebula. relathig to the ConstructiOn of the [IHeave7s. About the latter end of the same year I remarkled that it Twas not equally surrounded, butmost nebulous towards the. south. In 1784 I: began to entertain anopinion that the star wsxS <not connectedc with the nebulosity of the great nebula of Orion, but was one of those which are scattered over that part of the heavens. In 18oi, i8oG, ad i8:o thisopinion was fully confirmed, by the gradual change which, happened in the great nebula, -to which the nebulosity surrounding this star bklongs. For the intensity of the light about the nebulous star had by this time been considerably reduced, by the attenuation or dissipat4 tion of the nebulous matter; and it seemed now to be pretty evident that the star is far behind thoe nebulous matter, and that consequently its light in passing through it is scattered and deflected, so as to produce the appearance of a nebulous star. A similar phenomenon may be seen whenever a planet -or a star of the 1st or 2nad mnagnwitude happens to be involved in haziness; for a diffised circular light will thenbe seen, to which, but in a much inferior degree, that which surrounds thi's nebulous star bears a -great resemblance. When I reviewed this interesting object in Dececmber i8io, I directed my attention particularly to the two small nebulous stars, by the sides of the large one, and found that they wereperfectly free from every nebulous appearance; which' confirmed not only my former surmise of the great attenuation of the nebulosity, but also proved that their former nebulous appearance had been entirely the effect of the passage of their feeble light through the nebulous matter spread out before-them. MDCCCXI. T t .?322 Dr. HERsCHEL'S Astronomical Observatzons The i9th of January 18ii, I had another critical examination. of the same object in a very clear view through the 40o feet telescope; but notwithstanding the superior light of this. instrument, I could not perceive any remains of nebulosity about the two small stars, which were perfectly clear, and in the same situation, where about thirty-seven years before I had seen them involved in nebulosity. If then the light of these three stars is thus proved to have undergone a visible modificatiotn in its passage through the neibulous matter, it follows that its situation among the stars is less distant from us than the largest of the three, which I suppose to be of the 8th or 9th magnitude. The farthest distance therefore at which we can place the faintest part of the great nebula in Orion, to which the nebulosity surrounding the star belongs, cannot well exceed the region of the stars of the 7th or 8th magnitude, but may be much nearer; perhaps t may not amount to the dista ce of the stars of the 3d or 2nd order; and consequently the most luminous appearance of this nebula must be supposed to be still nearer to us. Fior, the very considerable chancges I have observed in the arrangement of its nebulosity, as well as from its great extent, this i*nference seert-s to have the support of observation; for in very distant objects we cannot so easily perceive changes as in near ones, on account of the smaller angles which both the objects and its charges subtend at the eye. That follo ving memorandum was made when I viewed it in 1774; its "shape is not like that which Dr. SMITH has delineated in his optics, though somewhat resenblimg it, being nearly as in fig9 97: from this we may infer that there are undoubtedly & thmtges aRonD th regions o h fixed stars ; and per1aps treatztng to the Construction of the Heavens. 323 "from a careful observation of this lucid spot, smmct:Xng may 'be concluded concerning the nature of it." In January 1783, the nebulous appearance dit reld 'uhch from what it was in 1780, and in Septemper it hlad g-al Un dergone a change in its shape since JanIuary. March 13, 18i t. With da view to ascertain such obovious alterations in the disposition of the nebulous matter as rnay be depended on, I selected a telescope that had the salre light and owver whichl thirty-seveni years ago I used, %`Yiln I made the above-mentioned drawing; and the relative situation of th, stars remaining as before, I found that the arrangement of the ne bulosity differs considerably. The orthern brnich .Nstill remains nearly parallel to the direction oC the stars a b ; but the southern branch S is no longer extenderd towards the star d; its direction is now towards e, which is very faintly nnvolved in it The figure of the branch is also diflferent; the nebulosity in the parallel P F of the three stars being more advanced towards the following side than it was formerly. I compared also the present appearance of this nebula with the delineation which HIUYGJJENs has given of it in his Systema Saturzium, page 8,of which fig. a8 is a copy. The twielye stars which he has marked are sufflicient to pMint out the arrangement of the nebulous matter at the time of hs observation. By their situation we find that thle nebula had no southern branch, nor indeed any to the north, U nless ye call the nebulosity in the direction of the paraliel a branch; but then this, branch is not parallel to a line drawn from a to the star b; moreover the starf is now involved 'in faint nebulosity, which also reaches nearly up to g, and quite incloses h. The star & T t Se;+ Dr. HIERscEIIL'S Astronomical Observat'oss which is now nebulous, is represented as perfectly out of all nebulosity, and can hardly be supposed to have been affected when HUYGHENS observed it. The changes that are thus proved to have already hap... pened, prepare us for those that may be expected hereafter to take place, by the gradual condensation of the nebulous. matter for had we no where an instance of any alteration in the appearance of nebulke, they might be lookedupon as per. manent celestial bodies, and the successive changes, to, which by the action of an attracting principle they have been conceived to be subject,, might be rejected as being unsupported by observation. The various appearances of this nebula are so instructive,. that I shall apply them to the subject of the partial opacity of the nc-bulous matter, which has already been inferred from its" planetary appearance, when extremely condensed in globular masses; but which now maybe supported by more direct arguments. For when I formerly saw three fictitious nebulous stars, it will not be contended that there were tfhree small hining nebulosities just in the three lines in which I saw them, of which two are now gone and only one retmainiitng. As well. might we ascribe the light surroundina a star, xwhich is seen through a imist, to a quality of shining belonging to that particular part of the mist, which by chance hlapperneA to be situated where the star is seen. If then t e forn.-Cr nebulosity of the two stars svich have ceased to be nebulou.D can only beascribed to an effect of ffie transit or penetra1iunof their light through nebulous matter which1 deflected iand scattered it, we have now a direct proof that this mSatter can extt 'I a state of 7eating to the Constructin of the THavens. t opacity, and may possibly be diffused in many parts of the heavens without our being able to perceive it. That there has been shining as well as opaque nebulous matter about the large star, appears from several observations I have made upon the light which surrounded it. In 17-83 the nebulosity about it was so considerable in brightness, and so much on one side of it, that the star did not appear to have any connection with it. The reason of which is plainly, that the shining quality of the nebulous matter then overpowered the feeble scattering of the light of the star in the nebulosity. gc2. Of Stellar Nebula. It has been remarked that diffused nebulosities may exist unknown to us, among the more distant regions of the fixed stars; and though we may not be able to see a nebulous diffusion that is farther from us than the moderate distance at vhich we now have reason to suppose the faintest visible nebulosity of the nebula in Orion to..be placed; yet if some former diffusion of the nebulous matter should be already reduced into separate and much condensed. nebulo, they might Ahen come within the reach of telescopes that have a great power of collecting light: this being admitted, there is a probability that some of the various diffusions of the nebulous natter, from which our present nebuladerive their origin, may have been much farther from 'us than others, For, inl every description of figure, size and condensation, of which I have given instances, we find not only very bright and very large, but also faint and small, as well as extremely faint andt extremely small nebula ; and the same gradations will nowv ibe found to run through that class which I have called steila; DI 6-I ERSCiEL's Astronomical Observationsnebn.sXO This classification was introduced in my sweeps when tVe oechi-.ts to be recorded came in so quick a succession that fourd it exlxdient to extpress as much as I could in as few wvorcds as possible, and by calling a nebula stellar, I intended to denote that tlhe object to wvhich I gave this name was, in the first place as small, or almost as small, as a star; and in the next, that notwithstanding its smallness, and starlike ap. pearance, it bore evident marks of not being one of those objects which we call stars, and of which I saw many at the same time in the telescope. The following three collections contain one hundred and seventeen stellar nebuliw which have been assorted by their brightness, thrat their comparative condensation might be estimated according to the different distances at vhicli we may suppose other nh-bukx of the same degree of light to be placed.: I. 7 i is 's A considerably bright, very small, almost stellar cc nebula,; the brightness diminishing insensibly and breaking "9 off pretty abruptly. The whole together is not more than "abeout 7 or 8" in dianeter." A second observation, made in a remarkable clear morning, says, that," the greatest brightness is towards the following side, and that the very faint n liulosity extends to near a minute." TIhis is probably a condensation of a former nucleus with Surroundin g chevelure. L. 68 is "6 A very bright, very snall, round stellar nebula.-" Fig. 39 This may be a formrarer planetary nebula in a 1-igher state of cond ensati n.* See Firt assortment cont1aining 5s. of the brightest stellar nebule.

It may have been a pretty well defined planetary nebula. If it should be deemed singoular that we have not a greater number of bright stellar nebula, I must remark that, if the stellar is a succession of the planetary state, the number of bright stellar is sufficiently proportionable to that of the planetary nebula; and as the faint nebula are far more numerous' than the bright ones, so it will be seen by the references in the two next assortments, that in proportion as brightness decreases, we have a much more copious collection of stellar nebulh.* II. 663 s " A pretty bright very smnall stellar nebula," This nebula and the rest ofthefnl, which are all of the same description, must be lookcd upon as condensations of distant nebulx that had nuclei, or Ter nearly about the planetary coindition.t* See Second assortment containing eleven stellar nebuk. of the next degree (f brightness Y 7'9, !78, 179, 204, 232, 6639 676, 689, 708, 82o, 867, 1 See Third assortment containing cne hundred slcllur nebula: < several degrees of faintness. lIb. t 27, 194, 244, %0, 340,-9 4`25, /4-43s 443, 4<49 49, 4-54, 5'!, i 576.4 6i8, 6zo, 692, 693, 7183,72!, 722, 7 35, 746, 78i3, 81 & ML Si 109, 154, 196 P.t HERSCHEL'S9 Asstr-U;onomical Observatkions In this. collection of nebulx we have many of a, difierent description. In some, the mark whereby they were disting guished from stars was their figure, the object not being so small but that its figure, might still be perceived.

Concluding Remarks. The total dissimilitude between the appearance of a diffiusion of the nebulous matter and of a star, is so striking, that an idea of the conversion of the one into the other can hardly occur to any one, who has not before him the result of the criticalSee Second assortment, containing five stellar nebula verified wthi djfficulty.

Act examination of the nebulous system which has been displayed in this paper. Th.e end I have had in view, by arranging my observations in the order in which they have been placed, has been to shew, that the above mentioned extremes may be connected by such nearly allied intermediate steps, as will make it highly probable that every succeeding state of the nebulous matter is the result of the action of gravitation upon it while in a foregoing one, and by such steps the successive condensation of it h'as been brought up to the planetary condition. From this the transit to the stellar form, it has beien shown, reires but a very small additional compression of o nebulous matter, and several instances have been given *NNhich connect the planetary to the stellar appearance The faint stellar nebule have also been well connected with all sorts of faint nebulh of a larger size; and in a number of the smaller sort, their approach to the starry appearance is so advanced, that in my observations of many of them it became doubtful whether they were not stars already. It must have been noticed, that I have confined myself in every one of the preceding articles to a few remarks upon the appearance of the nebulous matter in tihe state in which my observations represented it;s they seemed to be the natural result of the observations under consideration, and were not given with a view to establish a systematic opinion, such as will admit of complete demonstration. The observations themselves are arranged so conveniently that any astronomer, chemist, or philosopher, after having considered my critical remars, inmay form what judgment appears ;nost probable to him, At all events, the subject is of such a nature as cannot fail to attract tile notice of every inquisitive mind to a cont eiUu. 102 J Dr. HERSCHEL'S Astronornkcal Obseroations p1ation of the stupendous construction of the heavens; and v1 at I have said may at least serve to throw some new lightup n the organization of the celestial bodies.

The rich collect tion ofclusters of stars contained in the 6th, 7th, and 8th classes of my Catalogues, and many of the Connoissance des Temps, have as yet been left unnoticed. Several other objects, in which stars and nebulosity are mixed, such as nebulous stars nebulae containing stars, or suspected clusters of stars which yet may be nebulx, have not been introduced, as they ape peared to belong to the sidereal part of the construction of the heavens, into a critical examination of which it was not my intention to enter in this Paper.
