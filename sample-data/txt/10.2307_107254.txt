C 148 3 VI. A numerical Table of elective Attractions; with Remarks on the Sequences of double Decompositions. By Thomas Young, M. D. For. Sec. R. S. Read February 9, 1809. ATTEMPTS have been made, by several chemists, to obtain a series of numbers, capable of representing the mutual attract tive forces of the component parts of different salts; but these attempts have hitherto been confined within narrow-limits, and have indeed been so hastily abandoned, that some very important consequences, which necessarily follow from the general principle of a numerical representation, appear to have been entirely overlooked. It is not impossible, that there may be some cases, in which the presence of a fourth substance, be-, sides the two ingredients of the salt, and the medium in which they are dissolved, may influence the precise force of their mutual attraction, either by affecting the solubility of the salt, or by some other unknown means, so that the number, naturally appropriate to the combination, may no longer correspond to its affections but there is reason to think that such cases are rare; and when they occur, they may easily be noticed as exceptions to the general rules. It appears therefore, that nearly all the phenomena of the mutual actions of a hundred different salts may be correctly represented by a hundred numbers, while, in the usual manner of relating every case as a different experiment, above two thousand separate articles would be required. Dr. YOUNG'S Account of a numerical Table, &c. 149 Having been engaged in the collection of a few of the principal facts relating to chemistry and pharmacy, I was induced to atternpt the -investigation of a series of these numbers; and I have succeeded, not without some difficulty, in obtaining such as appear to agree sufficiently well with all the cases of double decompositions which are fully established, the excep. tions not exceeding twenty, out of about twelve hundred casesenumerated by FouRcRoY. The same numbers agree in general with the order of simple elective attractions, as usually laid down by chemical authors; but it was of so much less importance to accommodate them to these, that I have not been very solicitous to avoid a few inconsistencies in this respect, especially as many of the bases of the calculation remain uncertain, and as the common tables of simple elective attrac-tions are certainly-imperfect, if they are considered as indi-" cating the order of the independent attractive forces of the, substances concerned. Although it cannot be expected that these numbers should -be accurate measures of the forces which they represent, yet they may be supposed to be tolerable approximations to such measures, at least if any two of them are nearly in the true proportion, it is probable that the; rest cannot deviate very far from it: thus, if the attractive force of the phosphoric acid for potash is about eight tenths, of that of the sulfuric acid for barita that of the plhosphoric acid for barita must be about nine tenths as great; but they are calculated only to agree with a certaiu number of phenoinena, and will probably require many alterations, as well as additions, when all other similar phenom-iena shall have been accurately investigated. There is, however, a method of representing the facts, which Jo DI%. YOUNGS Account Of a numerical Table haver served as the bases of the determination, independently of anv h p'thesis, and without being liable to the contingent necessity of any future alteration, in order to make room for the introduction of the affections of other substances; and tiis method enables us also to compare, upon general princirples, a multitude of scattered phenomena, and to reject many which have been mentioned as probable, though doubtful, with the omission of a very few only which have been stated as ascertained. This arrangement simply depends on the supposition, that the attractive force, which tends to unite any two substances, may always be represented by a certain constant quantity. From this principle it may be inferred, in the first place, that there must be a sequence in the simple elective attractions., For example, there must be an error in the common tables of elective attractions, in which magnesia stands above ammonia under the sulfuric acid, and below it under the phosphoric, and the phosphoric acid stands above the sulfuric under magnesia, and below it under amionnia, since such an arrangement implies, that the order of the attractive forces is this; phosphate of magnesia, sulfate of magnesia, sulfate of ammonia phosphate of ammonia, and again phosphate of magnesia; which forms a circle, and not a sequence. We must therefore either place magnesia above ammonia under the phosphoric acid, or the phosphoric acid below the sulfuric under magnesia; or w te must abandon the principle of a numerical representation in this particular case. In the second place, there must be an agreement between the simple and double elective attractions. Thus, if the fluoric acid stands above the nitric under barita, and below it under of elective Attractions. lime, the fluate of barita cannot decompose the nitrate of lime, since the previous attractions of these two salts are respect tively greater, than the divellent attractions of the nitrate of barita and the fluate of lime. Probably, therefore, we ought to place the fluoric acid below the nitric under barita; and we may suppose, that when the fluoric acid has appeared to form a precipitate with the nitrate of barita, there has been some fallacy in the experiment. The third proposition is somewhat less obvious, but perhaps of greater utility: there must be a continued sequence in the order of double elective attractions ; that is, between any two acids, we may place the different bases ini such an order, that any two salts, resulting from their union, shall always decompose each other, unless each acid be united to the base nearest to it: for example, sulfuric acid, barita, potass, soda, ammonia, strontia, magnesia, glycina, alumina, zirconia, lime, phosphoric acid. The sulfate of potass decomposes the phosphate of barita, because the differenc*e of tlhe -attractions of barita for the sulfuric and phosphoric acids is greater than the difference of the similar attractions of potass ; and in the same manner thie diffirence of the attractions of potass is greater than that of the attractions of soda ; consequently the difference of the attractions of barita must be mnch greater than that of the attractions of soda, and the sulfate of soda must decompose 'the phosphate of barita: and in the same manner it may be shown, that each base must preserve its relations of priority or posteriority to every other in the series. It is also obvious that, for similar reasons, the acids may be arranged in a continued sequence between the diiffrent bases; and when all the decompositiolls of a certain number of salts 15052 Dr. YOuNGts Acco nt of a numerical Table have been investigated, we may form two corresponding tables, one of the sequiences of the bases with thee acid:, anid another of those of the acids wvith the different bases; and if either or both of the tables are imperfect, their deficiencies may often be supplied, and their errors corrected, by a repeated comparison with each other. In forming tables of this kind from the cases collected by FOURCROY, I have been obliged to reject some facts, which were evidently contradictory to others, and these I have not thought it necessary to mention; a few, which are positively related, and which are only inconsistent with the principle of numerical representation, I have mentioned in notes but many others, which have been stated as merely probable, I have omitted without any notice. In the table of simple elective attractions, I have retained the usual order of the different substances; inserting again in parentheses such of them as require to be transposed, in order to avoid inconsequences in the simple attractions: I have attached to each combination marked with an asterisc the number deduced from the double decompositions, as expressive of its attractive force; and where the number is inconsistent with the corrected order of the simple elective attractions, I have also inclosed it in a parenthesis. Such an apparent inconsistency may perhaps in some cases be unavoidable, as it is possible that the different proportions of the masses concerned, in the operations of simple and coimpound decomposition, may sometimes cause a real difference in the comparative magnitude of the attractive forces. Those numbers to which no asterisc is affixed are merely inserted by interpolation, and they can only be so far employed for determining the mutual actions of the salts to which they belong, of elective Attractions. 153, as the results which they indicate would follow from the cornparison of any other numbers, intermediate to the nearest of those, which are more correctly determined. I have not been able to obtain a sufficient number of facts relating to the metallic salts, to enable me to comprehend many of them in the tables. It has been usual to distinguish the attractions, which produce the double decompositions of salts, into necessary and superfluous attractions; but the distinction is neither very accurate, nor very important: they might be still further divided, accordingly as two, three, or the whole of the four ingredients concerned are capable of simply decomposing the salt in which they are not contained; and if two, accordingly as they are previously united or separate; such divisions would however merely tend to divert the attention from the natural operation of the joint forces concerned. It appears to be not improbable, that the attractive force of any two substances might, in many cases, be expressed by the quotient of two numbers appropriate to the substances, or rather by the excess of that quotient above unity; thus the attractive force of many of the acids for the three principal alkalies might probably be correctly represented in this manner; and where the order of attractions is different, perhaps the addition of a second, or of a second and third quotient, derived from a different series of numbers, would afford an accurate determination of the relative force of attraction, which would always be the weaker, as the two substances concerned stood nearer to each other in these orders of numbers; so that, by affixing, to each simple substance, two, three, or at most MDCCCIX. X 154 Dr. YOUNG'S Account of a numerical Table four numbers only, its attractive powers might be expressed in the shortest and most general manner. I have thought it necessary to make some alterations in the orthography generally adopted by chemists, not from a want of deference to their individual authority, but because it ap pears to me that there are certain rules of etymology, which no 'mode-rn author has a right to set aside. According to the orthography universally established throughout the language, without any material exceptions, our mode of writing Greek words is always borrowed from the Romans, whose alphabet we have adopted: thus the Greek vowel T, when alone, is always expressed in Latin and in English by Y, and the Greek diphthong or by U, the Romans having no such diphthong as OU or OY. The French have sometimes deviated from this rule, and if it were excusable for any, it would be for them, since their u and ou are pronouncedexactly as the T and oT of the Greeks probably were: but we have no such excuse. Thus the French have used the term acoustique, vhich some English authors have converted into " acoustics ;" our anatomists, however, speak, much more correctly, of the " acustic" nerve. Instead of glucine, we ought certainly, for a similar reason, to write glycine; or glycina, if the names of the earths are to end in a. Barytes, as a single Greek word, means weight, and must be pronounced barytes ; but as the name of a stone, accented on the second syllable, it must be written barites; and the pure earth may properly be called barita. Yttria I have altered to itria, because no Latin word begins with a Y. Table of the Sequences of the Bases with the different Acids.
