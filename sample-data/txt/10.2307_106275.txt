182 Mr. PIGOTT'S Astronomical Observations XI. Astronomical Observations made in the Austrian Netherlands in 1772 and 1773. By Nathanael Pigott, Esquire, F. R. S. Foreign Member of the Academies of Brussels and Caen. In a Letter to the Reverend Nevil Maskelyne, Astronomer Royal, F. R. S. TO THE REV. NEVIL MASKELYNE. Louvain, REV. SIR, August ~, 1775. I RECEIVED, about a month ago, the favour of your letter, and return you many thanks for the Greenwich observations, which you were so obliging to send me. I wait, with impatience, the publication of your journey into Scotland, which must be very curious and interesting. I beg of you, SIR, to present my respects to the Royal Society, with the inclosed astronomical observations, which I have contracted as much as I well could, consistently with a view of affording means to verify them, or rectify any mistake which, by inadvertency, may have crept in. I shall only add a short account of the instruments I used, and the elements I employed in the calculations, that a proper judgement may be formed, how far these observations may be depended upon. R. Dec. 9, 1775. The meridian altitudes were taken with a quadrant one foot radius made by Mr. BIRD, very steadily fixed; free from any communication with the floor, and well placed in the plane of the meridian. I Repeated made in the Austrian Netherlands. 183 Repeated observations for the error of the line of collimation gave 1~ 58~,7 additive to the zenith distances. I always observed both the limbs of the Sun on the meridian, when the weather would permit: its declination was computed from the Nautical Almanac: its parallax and all refractions, account being always kept of the height of the barometer and thermometer, from Professor MAYER'S tables, published by the Board of Longitude. The declinations of the fixed stars were taken from the Connoissance des tems. The corrections on account of aberration and nutation, were either taken from the same ephemeris, or computed. My son always observed ~'s satellites with a reflector, made by SHORT, of eighteen inches focal length, magnifying 95 times. I observed them with a reflector of two feet and a half focal length, made by WING, magnifying the diameter of the object about 200 times. The clock was a compound gridiron pendulum, made by the Sieur LE PAUTE at Paris. The equal altitudes were taken with a quadrant of eighteen inches radius. This astronomical journey was undertaken at the request of the government here. They expressed a desire that the situations of some of their towns, at least, should be determined by observation; and I readily concurred, without regretting either trouble or expence, in a project which had public utility in view. I am, &c. Cor184 Mr. PIGOTT'S Astronomical Observations Corresponding altitude of the Sun and Stars. 1772 h ~ ~ Aug. 30. Clock at noon corrected by four obs. of Sun, 11 54 7,9 Sept. 5.

At OSTENDE. By a mean of 24 meridian altitudes of the Sun and stars taken in December, one of which only, gives the latitude 11~,7 different from the mean of the whole, I determined the latitude of my observatory, in the Rue de la Poste 51~ 15~ 10~ North. The Connoissance des tems gives the lat. 51~ 13~ 55~; but I do not know in what part of the town, or by whom it was determined. At made in the Austrian Netherlands. 195 At OSTENDE, Dec. 23, 1772.

Twilight strong; sky very clear and serene; good observation. Dec. 24, at 3 hours P. M. I found the declination of the magnetic needle West 20~ 351/2~. At TOURNAI, 1773. By a mean of 14 meridian altitudes of the Sun and stars taken in January, one of which only gives the latitude 22~,8 different from the mean of the whole, I determined the latitude of my observatory in the Rue des Jesuites 50~ 36~ 57~ + North. The weather would not permit to observe either ~'s satellites, or an occultation of a star by the Moon, for the longitude of Tournai. C c 2 XII. An
