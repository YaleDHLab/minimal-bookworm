[153] XIX. Remarks upon a Passage in Castillione's Life of Sir ISAAC NEWTON. By John Winthrop, LL. D. Hollisian Professor of Mathematics, at Cambridge, in New England. T H E R E is a passage in CASTILLIONE'S life of Sir ISAAC NEWTON, prefixed to his edition of the OPUSCULA, in three volumes 4to. published at Lausanne and Geneva in 1744, which appears to me a palpable mistake; and tends to place Sir ISAAC NEWTON in an inferior light to DES CARTES, in the eyes of foreigners. It is this, p. xxxii: `` Saepius se reprehendebat [NEUTONUS] `` quod res mere geometricas algebraicis rationibus `` tractavisset, & quod libro suo de Algebra Arith`` meticae Universalis titulum posuisset, melius af`` serens CARTESIUM suum de re eadem volumen `` dixisse Geometriam, ut sic ostenderet has com`` putationes subsidia tantum esse Geometris ad `` inveniendum.'' The authority he quotes for this is Dr. PEMBERTON, in the preface to his View of Sir ISAAC NEWTON'S Philosophy; but I will venture to say, he has misinterpreted his Author. He represents Dr. PEMBERTON as saying; 1st, That Sir ISAAC NEWTON often cenVOL. LXIV. X sured Redde, Jan. 20, 1774. [154] sured himself for handling geometrical subjects by algebraic calculations: 2dly, That another thing he often censured himself for, was, his having called his book of Algebra by the name of Universal Arithmetic: 3dly, That he commended DES CARTES, as having done better, in giving the title of Geometry to his treatise on the same subject.The two last particulars, certainly, and I think the first also, have no foundation in the account Dr. PEMBERTON has given of this matter. His words are: `` I have often heard him [Sir ISAAC] `` censure the handling geometrical subjects by al`` gebraic calculations; and his book of Algebra `` he called by the name of Universal Arithmetic, `` in opposition to the injudicious title of Geome`` try, which DES CARTES had given to the trea`` tise, wherein he shews, how the geometer may `` assist his invention by such kind of computa`` tions.''Dr. PEMBERTON'S expression does not at all imply, that Sir ISAAC NEWTON censured himself for handling geometrical subjects by algebraic calculations: the only idea it suggests, is, that he censured that way in general, and those who practised it, and that he had his eye particularly upon DES CARTES;-and, far from intimating, that he had inconsiderately called his book of Algebra by the name of Universal Arithmetic, and afterwards censured himself for doing so, and wished that he had rather called it Geometry, as DES CARTES did his; it directly affirms, on the contrary, that by express design and choice, he called it Arithmetic, in opposition to DES CARTES'S injudicious title of Geometry. It [155] It is true, indeed, that in a following passage, Dr. PEMBERTON says, `` of their [the antients] taste `` and form of demonstration, Sir ISAAC always `` prosessed himself a great admirer: I have heard `` him even censure himself for not following them `` yet more closely than he did; and speak with `` regret of his mistake, at the beginning of `` his mathematical studies, in applying himself `` to the works of DES CARTES, and other alge`` braic writers, before he had considered the ele`` ments of EUCLID with that attention, which `` so excellent a writer deserves.'' But the mode of expression here used, is so different from the foregoing, that there can be no doubt, but that it was intended to convey a different meaning. And if, in the censure first mentioned, viz. `` for `` handling geometrical subjects by algebraic cal`` culations,'' Dr. PEMBERTON had understood that Sir ISAAC meant to include himself, this last passage would have been a mere tautology. But this last strongly implies, on the contrary, that Sir ISAAC had, in general, endeavoured to follow closely the antient geometrical form of demonstration, in preference to that by algebraic calculation; which is of modern invention. There is a remarkable instance of the attention he paid to the distinction between these methods, and of the preference he gave to the former, in his great work of the Principia. Having in Lemma XIX. and its Corollaries, given a concise and elegant solution of a noted geometric Problem, he subjoins: `` Atque ita problematis veterum de quaX 2 `` tuor [156] `` tuor lineis ab EUCLIDE incepti, & ab APOLLO`` NIO continuati, non calculus, sed compositio geo`` metrica, qualem veteres quaerebant, in hoc co`` rollario exhibetur.'' That the words, ``non cal`` culus sed compositio geometrica,'' refer to DES CARTES'S prolix, algebraic solution of this Problem, in his Geometry, p. 25-34, will, I believe, be readily granted by every one, that is acquainted with Sir ISAAC NEWTON'S writings. Upon the whole, I humbly conceive, that Dr. PEMBERTON'S meaning, in the former passage, might have been better expressed in Latin, as follows: `` Saepius eos reprehendebat, qui res mere `` geometricas algebraicis rationibus tractavissent; `` et libro suo de Algebra Arithmeticae Universalis `` titulum ponebat, asserens CARTESIUM suum de `` re eadem volumen inscite dixisse Geometriam, `` in quo ostendit, quomodo hae computationes sub`` sidia esse possunt geometris ad inveniendum.'' Which of these translations does most justly express the sense of the original, may, I suppose, be safely left to the judgement of every person that understands both the languages. I would only add, that this mistake of CASTILLIONE, must have been owing, either to inadvertence, or to his not being perfectly acquainted with the English language; as he elsewhere appears to have had the highest veneration for Sir ISAAC NEWTON. This mistake may, to some, appear trivial; but, in my apprehension, every circumstance, relative to so illustrious a character as that of Sir ISAAC NEWTON. [157] NEWTON, derives importance from it; and ought to be marked with great exactness. The foregoing remarks are, with all deference, submitted to the judgement of the ROYAL SOCIETY, by Their most obedient, humble Servant, Cambridge, New England, March 4, 1773. JOHN WINTHROP. XX. M.
