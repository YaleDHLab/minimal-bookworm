[26] VI. A Letter from the Rev. Nevil Maskelyne, M. A. F. R. S. to William Watson, M. D. F. R. S. Prince Henry, St. Helen's Road, S I R, Jan. 17, 1761. IN a letter which I wrote to you from this place, the beginning of this week, I desired you would, in your answer to Abbe De la Caille, acquaint him, that I had proposed to the Royal Society the observations of the moon's parallax, before his letter came; and that Dr. Bradley was to make observations at Greenwich, correspondent to mine at St. Helena; and that I was drawing up a list of the proper observations to be made, and the proper stars with which the moon was to be compared, which I proposed to transmit to the Abbe De la Caille, in order that he might attend to the same observations, if he thought proper. But as he has made out a list of proper opportunities of observing, I shall only set down five observations to be added thereto, which I beg you will transmit to the Abbe De la Caille; and likewise deliver a copy of the same to Dr. Bradley. I also desired in my letter, that you would desire the Abbe De la Caille, and the other French astronomers by him, to attend to the observations of the eclipses of Jupiter's satellites, especially the first, from May 1761 to June 1762, inclusive, in order to settle the difference of longitude between Paris and St. Helena; which if it came in the name of the Society, it would be better; and that you would also deliver it Read Jan 22, 1761. [27] it as my request to the Society, that they would recommend it to my Lord Macclesfield, Dr. Bradley, Mr. Raper, and Mr. Short, and any other gentlemen they know propose to attend carefully to the observation of the transit of Venus, to make as many observations of the eclipses of the satellites as they conveniently can, in order to settle the difference of longitude between their place of observation and and St. Helena, in the most exact manner; which is of the utmost importance with respect to the use to be made of the observations of the transit of Venus. We sailed from hence last Tuesday; but the wind not holding, returned hither again the next day. We are now under way again; but doubt whether the wind will serve for us. I am sorry to hear of the accident, which befel the Sea-horse, though they came off victors. I hope it will not stop their voyage; for I learn, that if they sail in a fortnight, they may still be in time. I am, Your obedient humble servant, N. Maskelyne. E 2 1762. [28] Sydera 1762. Observ.
