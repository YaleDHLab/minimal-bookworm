X III. On a new Property of the Tangents of the three Angles of a Plane Triangle. By Mr William Garrard, Quarter Master oJ Instruction at the Royal Naval Asylum at Greenwich. CGomunuincated by the Astronomer Royal. Read February 11, 18o-8. PROPOSITION I. In every acute angled plane triangle, the sum of the three tangents of the three angles multiplied by, the square of the radius, is equal to the continued product of the tangents. Demonstration.-Let AH, HI, and IB . be the arches to represent the give / angles; and AG, HK, and BT be their Gtangents, put r the radius, AGa, and BT=b, \ Then rand r will be the tangents of < a HD and DI. Now by Prop. VIII. Sect. I. Book I. EMERSON'S Trigonometry, A C As radius square-product of two tangents Is to radius square, So is the sum of the tangents To the tangent of their sum. :r r r:a + rabHK ab a +b : 7brz therefore a + b + ra+rrb __ aa-b+a? = the sum of the three -ab r2z ab tangents-, and aab + ab xrX _abxralr b their continued product. ab -Erz a O0. E. D. Mr. GARRARD on a new Property of the Tangents, &c. 121 PROPOSITION IL. In every obtuse angled plane triangle, the sum of the three tangents of the three angles multiplied by the square of radius, is equal to their continued product. Demonstration.-Let AH be an obtuse T arc, and HE, ED the other two. Then BF, ED, and AG are the three. tangents. Put BF=t and DE = u radius = r, then per trigonometry, as before, E r x=.BT; r'-tu ~ ~ ~ ~pCy But BT=AG rlL xr2. Wherefore t + u -tu x r2 the sum of the three tangents, which being reduced is tu x tu, and, multiplied into ze is equal to G tu X + it x r2 the product. X 2r us Q.E. D. AIDCCCVIII. R
