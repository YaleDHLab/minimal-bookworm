LXXVII. An Extract of a Letter from Mons. Grovestins, Master of the Horse to his R. H. the Prince of Orange, LieutenantGeneral, Commandant of the Forces, concerning an Earthquake felt by himself at the Hague, on Wednesday the 18th of Feb. 1756. Translated from the French, and communicated by the Rev. William Parker, D. D. F. R. S. ON Wednesday morning, twelve minutes after eight, we had a shock of an earthquake. I was then reading: my chair received Read Mar. 4, 1756. [545] received five successive shakes. The sconces in the chamber were in like manner moved. Ten or twelve minutes after, I perceived a second shock, but not so strong as the former. The water, which I looked upon, remained quiet. The air was calm. There was a little fog. The Wind was S.W. Immediately after the earthquake, it turned N.E. The news from Maestricht and Utrecht brings word, that they have likewise felt it there. LXXVIII.
