These Seeds I have seen come several times heretofore from the Coast of Coromandel and Malabar, where they are used for the clarifying Water. They are about the Bigness of a small Pea, only broader and flatter, having Striae run from their Center after the manner of the common Nux Vomica. The best Account I have had of the way of using them was from Dr. Brown,who lived in the East-Indies some time, he says they rub or grate them on the bottom of a small Earthen Bason, wherein is contained some Water. This Water and Powder is put into a large Quantity of muddy, or foul Water, which is by this clarified. Nux pepita seu faba sancti Ignatii. This is figured No. 7. being about the bigness of a Nutmeg, and Triangular. This Fruit is very much esteemed in the Philippine Islands for the Cure of many Distempers, as will be more at large seen in the next Transaction, wherein is design'd to be published from Mr. Buckly, a further Account of it, and the Description and Figure of its Leaves, Flower, &c. drawn and sent from the Philippine Islands, where it grows, by Father Kamelli, to Mr. Ray and Mr. Pettiver, Fellows of the Royal Society.
