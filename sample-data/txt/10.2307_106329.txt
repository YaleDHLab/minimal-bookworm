That marked S is comp of quicksilver, and of a lighter fluid, for the purpose of making the alteratior visible, which is a very great convenience at sea; a quicksilver thermometer being it for the sake of correcting its height, the heat by which is set down in the marked Th. next to that marked S. 4th, The weather and winds in four lines; 1st line from noon to 6 P.M.; 2d, 6 P.M. to midnight; 3d, from midnight to 6 A.M.; 4th, from 6 A.M. to noon. In the column of weather, f. denotes fair; sq. squally; c. cloudy; h. hazy; r. rain; hard rain; sr. small rain; dr. r. drizling rain; sh. showers; th. thunder; l. lightning. It is proper to remark, that the winds are set down according to the compass, with allowance for the Variation. 5th in 2, The difference between the daily alteration of latitude by account an vation; N. denoting that the observation was to the Northward of the account; S. was to the Southward(b).

Light airs of wind Easterly, with calms. Some swallows and other land birds, who seem very tired. In the after~ noon, during the calm, when the ship's head was to the Southwestward, there was, for a little time, a counter current visible; it made like a wake on the ship's larboard beam, as if she was going broadside foremost. Light airs of wind throughout. P.M. saw two three-mast vessels with latine sails; they were supposed to be Barbary cruizers, but did not come near enough to let us know what they were. Some swallows about the ship. An increasing breeze from the Northward. In the morning ~ there were many petrils in the ship's wake: they continued throughout the day. ~ Fresh breezes, with some squalls. At noon saw Porto Santo from the mast-head, W by S. per compass. In Funchal road. Major SEARS informed us, that Mr. SEARL, in consequence of our request, tried the therm. for 10~ in a cool cellar, and found it 68~. N. B. Captain ALCOCK informed me, he observed the therm. on May 14, 1776, at 6 A.M. at Funchal 68~, and in the cellar 61~: and Mr. SEARL wrote to Mr. CAVENDISH, that on the 16th of May the therm. which stood at 69~, was carried down at 1 P.M. to a cellar, where it remained till 4 o'clock, and then was found to be at 62~, so that Major SEARS'S account was probably erroneous. First part, light airs. Middle and latter, pleasant breezes and smooth weather; several boats came off from Funchal. These 24 hours pleasant breeze from Eastward. 3 Journal of a Voyage to The East-Indies, in the Ship ~ D. L. Longitude fro D. L. ~ Th. Marine Barometer Weather and Winds. A. O. T. K. A. TK. 1775 R. S.
