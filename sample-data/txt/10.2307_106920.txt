V. A Supplement to the Measures of Trees, printed in the Philosophical Transactious for i7Sg. By Robert Marsham, Esq. F. R. S. Read December 22, 1796. THESE measures were all taken by myself, except the second, of the ash in Scotland; and that I believe is fair. As that is the largest ash, and as thriving as any I had seen, I was desirous to procure a second measure of it. The measures (where there was no impediment) were taken at five feet from the earth, as the easiest height to run the line even, and a fair height for the bulk of the body. For most trees (at least oaks and chesnuts) are frequently found to be one-third more in circumference at one foot than at five. Where I have measures of more than one tree of the same kind, I give the largest and a smaller, to show the different proportion of the increase of their different sizes: and as trees standing single generally increase more than those in groves, I mark them with an S. and a G. as the difference is more than would be expected by those that think little of trees. In 1719 I had about two acres sowed with acorns, and from 1729 to 1770 I planted oaks from this grove, always leaving the best plants standing for the future grove: but most of the transplanted trees are already larger than those that were not removed; the largest of which is now (1795) but five feet Mr. MARSHAM Ofl the Measures, &c. 1129 6 inches 8 tenths in circumference; and the ktrgest trans.." planted, tree (which was planted in 01:735 is 8 ft. 8 'in. 7 tenths, viz, near 38 inches gained by transplanting in,6o year. And in beeches: fromseed, in 1733,the Iargest is now (1795) but 6 feet : inches;Ad and -the as largest transplanted 7beech -i 7 fet H inches i tenth, viz. 8 inches larger, although the transplanted beech is eight years younger than that ;from the seed. This proves that it is better to plant a grove, than to raise one from the seed. The expence of plantingis -inconsiderable, andethe planted trees are full as good and handsome; and many years are saved, beside, thetextra:growth of planted tres. Bt this extra growth will not prove near so great in :-groves as in single trees. The first grove I planted from these sacornsof 1719 was in 1731. In 1732 I made another grove from them; and in 1735 I planted a third grove from them; and in 1753 the last considerable number of plants:v were: taken from; the grove, and these are very good trees: so 34 years may be saved. But I would by no means advise the planting trees so large, as the trouble and expence will be too much, unless where a shelter or screen is wanted. Whether, a grove is to be raised from seeds, or planted, it is advisable to shelter it round; if from the seed, with such sorts as will grow quicker; and if by planting, with larger and, taller trees. The soil in Norfolk is unfavourable to elms therefore in planting I will venture to recommend hornbeams,as they may be planted large trees. I planted some hornbeams (rather large) in I 7y, and disliking their situation, in 1792 1 removed them when they were about three feet in circumference, and did not lose one tree; and they made shoots of MDCCXCVIIT. S IfSP "Mr. MARSuM on th~e near half a yard that year; but I ought to say I cut off their heads. BeforeI quit this subject, Iwill presume to recommend, if' young oaks are unthriving, -there is reason to hope they may be helped by cutting them down to a foot or six inches: for in 1750 I planted some oaks from my grove of 171g into a poorer soil, and although they lived, they were sickly; so in 1761 I cut most of them down to one fot, and then by cutting off the side shoots, in three or four years led them into a single stem, and most of them are now thriving and handsome trees; and you can hardly see where they were cut off, and some are four feet round and I have used the -same method, with un.healthy chesnuts, beech, hornbeam, andwych elm, and with the same success R.
