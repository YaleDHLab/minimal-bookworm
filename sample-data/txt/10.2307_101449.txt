Note. The Reader of these Papers is desired, that in those of Numb. 4. pag. 60. lin. 10. he would please to read eight, instead of hundred; this latter word having been put in by a great over-sight, and, without this Correction, injuring that Author, whose Considerations are there related. This Advertisement should have been given in Numb. 5. but was omitted for haste. Imprimatur Rob. Say, Vice-Cancel. Oxon. Oxford, Printed by Leonard Lichfield, for Richard Davis. 1665.
