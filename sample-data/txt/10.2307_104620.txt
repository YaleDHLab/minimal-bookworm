Some Account of the Remains of John Tradescant's Garden at Lambeth; by Mr. W. Watson F. R. S. U P O N a Visit made to Mr. John Tradescant's Garden at South Lambeth, May 21, 1749. by Dr. Mitchell and myself, were observed the under-mention'd exotic Plants. This Garden was planted by the above-mention'd Gentleman about an hundred and twenty Years since, and was, except that of Mr. John Gerard, the Author of Read May 25. 1749. [161] of the Herbal, probably the first botanical Garden in England. The Founder, after many Years spent in the Service of the Lord Treasurer Salisbury, Lord Wotton, &c. travell'd several Years, and procured a great Variety of Plants and Seeds before not known in England; to several of which at this time the Gardeners give his Name, as a Mark of Distinction; as Tradescant's Spiderwort, Tradescant's After, Tradescant's Daffodil. He first planted here the Cupressus Americanus Acaciae foliis deciduis, which has been since so much esteem'd, and is now one of the great Ornaments of the Duke of Argyll's Garden at Witton. Mr. Tradescant's Garden has now been many Years totally neglected, and the House belonging to it empty and ruin'd; and though the Garden is quite cover'd with Weeds, there remain among them manifest Footsteps of its Founder. We found there the Borrago latifolia sempervirens of C. B. Polygonatum vulgare latifolium C. B. Aristolochia clematitis recta C. B. and Dracontium Dod. There are yet remaining two Trees of the Arbutus, the largest I have seen; which, from their being so long used to our Winters, did not suffer by the severe Colds of 1729 and 1740, when most of their kind were kill'd throughout England. In the Orchard there is a Tree of the Rhamnus catharticus, about 20 Feet high, and near a Foot in Diameter, by much the greatest I ever saw. It is not unlikely but there may be several other Plants yet remaining in the Garden, but flourishing at a different Time of the Year. W. Watson. X XIV.
