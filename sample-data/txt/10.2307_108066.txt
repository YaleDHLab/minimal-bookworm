[ 247 3 XV. On a General Method in Dynamics; by which the Study of the Motions of allfree Systems of attracting or repelling Points is reduced to the Search and Differentiation of one central Relation, or characteristic Function. BY WILLIAM ROWAN HAMILTON, Jllenber of several scient/fic Societies in the British Dominions, and of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, Andrews' Professor of Astronomy in the University qf Dublin, and Royal Astronomer of Ireland. communicated by Captain BEAUFORT, R.NA F.R.S. Received April 1,-Read April 10, 1834. Introductoriy Remarks. THE theoretical development of the laws of motion of bodies is a problem of such interest and importance, that it has engaged the attention of all the most eminent mathematicians, since the invention of dynamics as a mathematical science by GALILEO, and especially since the wonderful extension which was given to that science by NEWTON. Among the successors of those illustrious men, LAGRANGE has perhaps done more than any other analyst, to give extent and harmony to such deductive researches, by showing that the most varied consequences respecting the motions of systems of bodies may be derived from one radical formula; the beauty of the method so suiting the dignity of the results, as to mlake of his great work a kind of scientific poem. But the science of force, or of power acting by law in space and time, has undergone already another revolution, and has become already more dynamic, by having almost dismissed the conceptions of solidity and cohesion, and those other material ties, or geometrically imaginable conditions, which LAGRANGE SO happily reasoned on, and by tending more and more to resolve all connexions and actions of bodies into attractions and repulsions of points: and while the science is advancing thus in one direction by the improvement of physical views, it may advance in another direction also by the invention of mathematical methods. And the method proposed in the present essay, for the deductive study of the motions of attracting or repelling systems, will perhaps be received with indulgence, as an attempt to assist in carrying forward so high an inquiry. In the methods commonly employed, the determination of the motion of a free point in space, under the influence of accelerating forces, depends on the integration of three equations in ordinary differentials of the second order; and the determnination of the motions of a system of free points, attracting or repelling one another, depends on the integration of a system of such equations, in numbler threefold the 2KE2 248 PROFESSOR HAMILTON ON A GENERAL METHOD IN DYNAMICS. number of the attracting or repelling points, unless we previously diminish by unity this latter number, by considering only relative motions. Thus, in the solar system, when we consider only the mutual attractions of the sun and of the ten known planets, the determination of the motions of the latter about the former is reduced, by the usual methods, to the integration of a system of thirty ordinary differential equations of the second order, between the coordinates and the time; or, by a transformation of LAGRANGE, to the integration of a system of sixty ordinary differential equations of the first order, between the time and the elliptic elements: by which integrations the thirty varying coordinates, or the sixty varying elements, are to be found as functions of the time. In the method of the present essay, this problem is reduced to the search and differentiation of a single function, which satisfies two partial differential equations of the first order and of the second degree: and every other dynamical problem, respecting the motions of any system, however numerous, of attracting or repelling points, (even if we suppose those points restricted by any conditions of connexion consistent with the law of living force,) is reduced, in like manner, to the study of one central function, of which the form marks out and characterizes the properties of the moving system, and is to be determined by a pair of partial differential equations of the first order, combined with some simple considerations. The difficulty is therefore at least transferred from the integration of many equations of one class to the integration of two of another: and even if it should be thought that no practical facility is gained, yet an intellectual pleasure may result from the reduction of the most complex and, probably, of all researches respecting the forces and motions of body, to the study of one characteristic function*, the unfolding of one central relation. The present essay does not pretend to treat fully of this extensive subject,-a task which may require the labours of many years and many minds; but only to suggest the thought and propose the path to others. Although, therefore, the method may be used in the most varied dynamical researches, it is at present only applied to the orbits and perturbations of a system with any laws of attraction or repulsion, and with one predominant mass or centre of predominant energy; and only so far, even in this one research, as appears sufficient to make the principle itself understood. It may be mentioned here, that this dynamical principle is only another form of that idea which has already been applied to optics in the Theory of systems of rays, and that an intention of applying it to the motions of systems of bodies was announced f* LAGRANGE and, after him, LAPLACE and others, have employed a single function to express the different forces of a system, and so to form in an elegant manner the differential equations of its motion. By this conception, great simplicity has been given to the statement of the problem of dynamics; but the solution of that problem, or the expression of the motions themselves, and of their integrals, depends on a very different and hitherto unimagined function, as it is the purpose of this essay to show. t Transactions of the Royal Irish Academy, vol. xv. page 80. A notice of this dynamical principle was also lately given in an article " On a general Method of expressing the Paths of Light and of the Planets," published in the Dublin University Review for October 1833. PROFESSOR HAMILTON ON A GENERAL METHOD IN DYNAMICS. 249 at the publication of that theory. And besides the idea itself, the manner of calculation also, which has been thus exemplified in the sciences of optics and dynamics, seems not confined to those two sciences, but capable of other applications; and the peculiar combination which it involves, of the principles of variations with those of partial differentials, for the determination and use of an important class of integrals, may constitute, when it shall be matured by the future labours of mathematicians, a separate branch of analysis. WILLIAM R. HAMILTON. Observatory, Dublin, March 1834. Integration of the Equations of Motion of a System, characteristic Function of such Motion, and Law of varying Action. 1. The known differential equations of motion of a system of free points, repelling or attracting one another according to any functions of their distances, and not disturbed by any foreign force, may be comprised in the following formula: E.m (rw x+y y +z" ) = YU.(l*) In this formula the sign of summation 1 extends to all the points of the system; m is, for any one such point, the constant called its mass; x!", y" z"., are its component accelerations, or the second differential coefficients of its rectangular coordinates x, Y, z, taken with respect to the time; x, by, w z, are any arbitrary infinitesimal displacements which the point can be imagined to receive in the same' three rectangular directions; and b U is the infinitesimal variation corresponding, of a function U of the masses and mutual distances of the several points of the system, of which the form depends on the laws of their mutual actions, by the equation U = E . m, f (r), . .(2.) r being the distance between any two points m, m, and the function f (r) being such that its derivative or differential coefficientf' (r) expresses the law of their repulsion, being negative in the case of attraction. The function which has been here called U, may be named the force-function of a system: it is of great utility in theoretical mechanics, into which it was introduced by LAGRANGE, and it furnishes the following elegant forms for the differential equations of motion, included in the formula (1.), t U ,, tU, U m1z1 =yau; m2z2 = au. e m e o te e bn t pi d c i Mly Y" s;M2,Y 2bY2^'*'B n Ey au au ti bU a u. m1~~~~~~ Z2 n = a Z 2Z2=8z; the second members of these equations being the partial differential coefficients of 250 PROFESSOR HAMILTON ON A GENERAL METHOD IN DYNAMICS. the first order of the function U. But notwithstanding the elegance and simplicity of this known manner of stating the principal problem of dynamics, the difficulty of solving that problem, or even of expressing its solution, has hitherto appeared insuperable; so that only seven intermediate integrals, or integrals of the first order, with as many arbitrary constants, have hitherto been found for these general equations of motion of a system of n points, instead of 3 n intermediate and 3 n final integrals, involving ultimately 6 n constants; nor has any integral been found which does not need to be integrated again. No general solution has been obtained assigning (as a complete solution ought to do) 3 n relations between the n masses Mi, M2, .. . m, the 3 n varying coordinates X1, Yi, z1, .. . y bt zn, the varying time t, and the 6 n initial data of the problem, namely, the initial coordinates a,, bl, cl, ... a, b , c , and their initial rates of increase, adi, b'1, c'1, ... a' , ,c' ; the quantities called here initial n~ n) being those which correspond to the arbitrary origin of time. It is, however, possible (as we shall see) to express these long-sought relations by the partial differential coefficients of a new central or radical function, to the search and employment of which the difficulty of mathematical dynamics becomes henceforth reduced. 2. If we put for abridgement _ n. (X'2 + y'2 + z'2), (4.) so that 2 T denotes, as in the Mecanique Analytique, the whole living force of the system; (x', y', z', being here, according to the analogy of our foregoing notation, the rectangular components of velocity of the point m, or the first differential coefficierts of its coordinates taken with respect to the time;) an easy and well known combination of the differential equations of motion, obtained by changing in the formula (1.) the variations to the differentials of the coordinates, may be expressed in the following manner, dT = dU,.. (5.) and gives, by integration, the celebrated law of living force, under the form T= u+ H.. (6.) In this expression, which is one of the seven known integrals already mentioned, the quantity H is independent of the time, and does not alter in the passage of the points of the system from one set of positions to another. We have, for example, an initial equation of the same form, corresponding to the origin of time, which may i-e written thus, TO uo + It(7) The quantity LI may, however, receive any arbitrary increment whatever, when we pass in thought from a system moving in one way, to the same system moving in another, with the same dynamical relations between the accelerations and positions of its points, but with different initial data; but the increment of H, thus obtained, PROFESSOR HAMILTON ON A GENERAL METHOD IN DYNAMICS. 2.o51 is evidently connected with the analogous increments of the functions T and U, by the relation AT=AU+AH,.(8.) which, for the case of infinitesimal variations, may conveniently be written thus, .= .+ I1(9.) and this last relation, when multiplied by dt, and integrated, conducts to an important result. For it thus becomes, by (4.) and (I.), f I.m(d x. '+dy./y'+dz.)z') fI N. m (d c' . 8 xc + d y' . 8dy + d z'. * z) +f J 1 H d t, (I ,*.*(0.) that is, by the principles of the calculus of variations, V= .m(x' x + yby+ z z) --.?n.m(a' a+b'3b+c' c) +t II,. . (A.) if we denote by V the integral V =f.in(x'dx+y'dy+z'dz) =fot2Tdt, .(B.) namely, the accumulated living force, called often the action of the system, from its initial to its final position. If, then, we consider (as it is easy to see that we may) the action V as a function of the initial and final coordinates, and of the quantity II, we shall have, by (A.), the following groups of equations; first, the group, aV , av a BV , 1 8 rX= l I1 a ,r22 , . ,,=mxn , n Secondly, the group, sV _ t a I_ _ ? f l p J M ,-nli b 1 Y2 =-2Yb2; *l/ nyu; -~Wnb **( a V t4 aV a sV _m -= --il C1; ---n2C2; . . . * * mc; and finally, the equation, . : . . . * . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . (E.) So that if this function V were known, it would only rmain to elimAinate L between th1e 3 nz + 1 equations (C-.) and (E.), in order to obtain all the 3 n intermediate integrabn or b etxveen (D.) and (E.) to obtain all thle 3 n final integrals of the diffierential equations of mnotion; that is, ultimuately, to obtain the 3 n soughlt relations between 252 FROFESSOR HAMILTON ON A GENERAL METHOD IN DYNAMICS. the 3 n varying coordinates and the time, involving also the masses and the 6 n initial data above mentioned; the discovery of which relations would be (as we have said) the general solution of the general problem of dynamics. We have, therefore, at least reduced that general problem to the search and differentiation of a single function V, which we shall call on this account the CHARACTERISTIC FUNCTION of motion of a system; and the equation (A.), expressing the fundamental law of its variation, we shall call the equation of the characteristicfunction, or the LAW OF VARYING ACTION. 3. To show more clearly that the action or accumulated living force of a system, or in other words, the integral of the product of the living force by the element of the time, may be regarded as a function of the 6 n + 1 quantities already mentioned, namely, of the initial and final coordinates, and of the quantity H, we mav observer that whatever depends on the manner and time of motion of the system may be considered as such a function; because the initial form of the law of living force, when combined with the 3 n known or unknown relations between the time, the initial data, and the varying coordinates, will always furnish 3 n + 1 relations, known or unknown, to connect the time and the initial components of velocities with the initial and final coordinates, and with H. Yet fromn not having formed the conception of the action as afifnction of this kind, the consequences that have been here deduced from the formula (A.) for the variation of that definite integral, appear to have escaped the notice of LAGRANGE, and of the other illustrious analysts who have written on theoretical mechanics; although they were in possession of a formula for the variation of this integral not greatly differing from ours. For although LAGRANGE and others, in treating of the motion of a system, have shown that the variation of this definite integral vanishes when the extreme coordinates and the constant 11 are given, they appear to have deduced from this result only the well known law of least action; namely, that if the points or bodies of a system be imagined to move from a given set of initial to a given set of final positions, not as they do nor even as they could move consistently with the general dynamical laws or differential equations of motion, but so as not to violate any supposed geometrical connexions, nor that one dynamical relation between velocities and configurations which constitutes the law of living force; and if, besides, this geometrically imaginable, but dynamically impossible motion, be made to differ infinitely little from the actual manner of motion of the system, between the given extreme positions; then the varied value of the definite integral called action, or the accumulated living force of the system in the motion thus imagined, will differ infinitely less from the actual value of that integral. But when this well known law of least, or as it might be better called, of stationary action, is applied to the determination of the actual notion of a system, it serves only to form, by the rules of the calculus of variations, the differential equations of motion of the second order, which can always be otherwise found. It seems, therefore, to be with reason that LAGRANGE, LAPLACE, and POISSON have spoken lightly of the utility of this principle in the present state of dynamics. A different estimate, perhaps, will be formed of that PROFESSOR HAMILTON ON A GENERAL METHOD IN DYNAMICS. 253 other principle which has been introduced in the present paper, under the name of the law of varying actions in which we pass from an actual motion to another motion dynamically possible, by varying the extreme positions of the system, and (in general) the quantity H, and which serves to express, by means of a single function, not the mere differential equations of motion, but their intermediate and their final integrals. VeSJications of theforegoing Integrals. 4. A verification, which ought not to be neglected, and at the same time an illustration of this new principle, may be obtained by deducing the known differential equations of motion from our system of intermediate integrals, and by showing the consistence of these again with our final Integral system. As preliminary to such verification, it is iuseful to observe that the final equation (6.) of living force, when comnbined with the system (C.), takes this new formn, 1 E 1 rs~v\2 t, 2 1v21 8 2 + t8 J+ ( }U + II;. (F.) and that the initial equation (7.) of living force becomes by (D.) *(1 V)2V2 + I + (a 2 }=UO+ H. (G.) These two partial differential equations, initial and final, of the first order and the second degree, must both be identically satisfied by the characteristic function V: they furnish (as we shall find) the principal means of discovering the form of that function, and are of essential importance in its theory. If the form of this function were known, we might eliminate 3 n 1 of the 3 n initial coordinates between the 3 n equations (C.); and although we cannot yet perform the actual process of this elimination, we are entitled to assert that it would remove along with the others the remaining initial coordinate, and would conduct to the equation (6.) of final living force, which might then be transformed into the equation (F.). In like manner we may conclude that all the 3 n final. coordinates could be eliminated together from the 3 n equations (D.), and that the result would be the initial equation (7.) of living force, or the transformed equation (G.). We may therefore consider the law of living force, which assisted us in discovering the properties of our characteristic function V, as included reciprocally in those properties, and as resulting by elimination, in every particular case, from the systems (C.) and (D.) and in treating of either of these systems, or in conducting any other dynamical investigation by the method of this characteristic func.. tion, we are at liberty to employ the partial differential equations (F.) and (G.), which that function must necessarily satisfy. It will now be easy to deduce, as we proposed, the known equations of motion (3.) of the second order, by differentiation and elimination of constants, from our intermeMDCCCXXXIV. 2 L 254 PROFESSOR HAMILTON ON A GENERAL METHOD IN DYNAMICS. diate integral system (C.), (E.), or even from a part of that system, namely, from the group (C.), when combined with the equation (F.).

Again, we were to show that our intermediate integral system, composed of the equations (C.) and (E.), with the 3 n arbitrary constants a,, bl, cl, . . . an, b, cn, (and involving also the auxiliary constant I,) is consistent with our final integral system of equations (D.) and (E.), which contain 3 n other arbitrary constants, namely, at1, b1 D c1 . . at,, b'1, C/ The immediate differentials of the equations (C.), (D.), (E.), taken wvith respect to the time, are, for the first group, PROFESSOR HAMILTON ON A GENERAL METHOD IN DYNAMICS. 255 d ay t1 d aV d aV ,I _ =r _x1; n * _._.M2 -m * _ _ d t ax., ' @1* d t ax2-, @ d t aa n "n n d aV daV d Vd Tt ~W= M1 II1; M ~ y=m fy2; .dty-M,/ I.. ..

(K.) By combining the equations (C.) with their differentials (H.), and with the relation (F.), we deduced, in the foregoing number, the known equations of motion (3.); and we are now to show the consistence of the same intermediate integrals (C.) with the group of differentials (I.), which have been deduced from the final integrals. The first equation of the group (I.) may be developed thus: ?

Nor would it have been much more difficult, by the help of the foregoing principles, to have integrated directly our integrals of the first order, and so to have deduced in a different way our final integral system. 6. It may be considered as still another verification of our own general integral equations, to show that they include not only the known law of living force, or the integral expressing that law, but also the six other known integrals of the first order, which contain the law of motion of the centre of gravity, and the law of description of areas. For this purpose, it is only necessary to observe that it evidently follows from the conception of our characteristic function V, that this function depends on the initial and final positions of the attracting or repelling points of a system, not as referred to any foreign standard, but only as compared with one another; and therefore that this function will not vary, if without mnaking any real change in either initial or final configuration, or in the relation of these to each other, we alter at once all the initial and all the final positions of the points of the system, by any common motion, whether of translation or of rotation. Now by considering three coordinate translations, we obtain the three following partial differential equations of the first order, which the function V must satisfy, av av I 8 + O ; i, . . . . . . . * ( ~av+ aV and by considering three coordinate rotations, we obtain these three other relations between the partial differential coefficients of the same order of the same characterist~ic function, PROFESSOR HAMILTON ON A GENERAL METHOD IN DYNAMICS. 257 ( Y YZ Zx + b (a C 1-b 8EV =O a -z a?(bv A-c -1}) =?; . .(P.) > (z a -T z) Cd a 8a) =0;| and if we change the final coefficients of V to the final components of mornentumn, and the initial coefficients to the initial components taken negatively, according to the dynamical properties of this function expressed by the integrals (C.) and (D.), we shall change these partial differential equations (O.) (P.), to the following, z .m T' E.mza' ; E .rn y' = E .m b'; E nmz' =z. m c' ; ...( 1.) and m .rn (xa y ) = .m (a b'-h a'); E WI (yz' --zy') = 1. n(bc'cb'); (16.) 1. m (z xxz') = I . m (c a!a c') J In this manner, therefore, we can deduce from the properties of our characteristic function the six other known integrals above mentioned, in addition to that seventh which contains the law of living force, and which assisted in the discovery of oiw method. Introduction of relative or polar Coordinates, or other marks of position of a Sjyste . 7. The property of our characteristic function, by which it depends only on the internal or mutual relations between the positions initial and final of the points of an. attracting or repelling system, suggests an advantage in employing internal or relative coordinates; and from the analogy of other applications of algebraical methods to researches of a geometrical kind, it may be expected that polar and other marks of position will also often be found useful. Supposing, therefore, that the 3 n final coordinates x1 l z1 . . . a n Yn Zn have been expressed as functions of 3 n other variables, 41 . . I73n and that the 3 n initial coordinates have in like manner been expressed as functions of 3 n similar quantities, which we shall call el e2... e , we shall proceed to assign a general method for introducing these new marks of position into the expressions of our fundamental relations. For this purpose we have only to transform the law of varying action, or the fundarnental formula (A.), by transforming the two sums, E~m (.,V + 8y + z'8z), and 1.m (a'8a+ b'b + c8 c), which it involves, and which are respectively equivalent to the following more developed expressions, 258 PROFESSOR HAMILTON ON A GENERAL METHOD IN DYNAMICS. . m ( + y', y + z' z) = ml (x', XI + Y'1 igYl + z')1) 1 + m2 (x2 bX2 +Y2 Y2 + Z2 Z2) . .

(S.) The quantities e1 e2... e3 and e', e'2.. . etse are now the initial data respecting the manner of motion of the system; and the 3 n final integrals, connecting these 6 n initial data, and the n masses, with the time t, and with the 3 n final or varying quantities 1 ;72 ... ..73nl which mark the varying positions of the n moving points of the system, are now to be obtained by eliminating the auxiliary constant II between the 3 n + 1 equations (S.) and (E.) ; while the 3 n intermediate integrals, or integrals of the'first order, which connect the same varying marks of position and their first differential coefficients with the time, the masses, and the initial marks of position, are the result of elimination of the same auxiliary constant H between the equations (R.) and (E.). Our fundamental formula, and intermediate and final integrals, can therefore be very simply expressed with any new sets of coordinates; and the partial differential equations (F.) (G.), which our characteristic function V must satisfy, and which are, as we have said, essential in the theory of that function, can also easily be expressed with any such transformed coordinates, by merely combining the final and. initial expressions of the law of living force, T = U + H. .

Nor is there any difficulty in deducing analogous transformations for the known differential equations of motion of the second order, of any system of free points, by taking the variation of the new form (T.) of the law of living force, and by attending to the dynamical meanings of the coefficients of our characteristic function.

And if we were to suppose (as it has often been thought convenient and even necessary to do,) that the n points of a system are not entirely free, nor subject only to their own mutual attractions or repulsions, but connected by any geometrical conditions, and influenced by any foreign agencies, consistent with the law of conservation of living force ; so that the number of independent marks of position should be now less numerous, and the forcefunction U less simple than before; it might still be proved, by a reasoning very similar to the foregoing, that on these suppositions also (which, however, the dynamical Spirit is tending more and more to exclude,) the accumulated living force or action V of the system is a characteristic motion-function of the kind already explained ; having the same kaws and formula of variation, which are susceptible of the same transformations; obliged to satisfy in the same way a final and an initial relation between its partial differential coefficients of the first order; conducting, by the variation of one of these two relations, to the same canonical forms assigned by LAGRANGE for the differential equations of motion; and furnishing, on the same principles as before, their intermediate and their final integrals. To those imaginable cases, indeed, in which the law of living force no longer holds, our method also would not apply; but it appears to be the growing conviction of the persons who have meditated the miost profoundly on the mathematical dynamics of the universe, that these are cases suggested by insufficient views of the mutual actions of body. 9. It results from the foregoing remarks, that in order to apply our method of the characteristic function to any problem of dynamics respecting any moving system the known law of living force is to be combined with our law of varying action; and that the general expression of this latter law is to be obtained in the following manner. We are first to express the quantity T, namely, the half of the living force of the systen, as a function (which will always be homogeneous of the second dimension,) of the differential coefficients or rates of increase at a2i &c., of any rectangular coordinates, or other marks of position of the system: we are next to take the variation of this homogeneous function with respect to those rates of increase, and to change the variations of those rates W a 'a, &c.) to the variations 1 g &c., of the marks of position themselves; and then to subtract the initial from the final value of the result, and to equate the remainder to V t V I. A slight consideration will show that this general rule or process for obtaining the variation of the characteristic function V, is applicable even when the marks of position r1' 27 &c., are not all independent of each other; which will happen when they have been made, from any motive of convenience, more numerous than the rectangular coordinates of the several points of the system. For if we suppose that the 3 n rectangular coordinates a Y1 * x . z , have been expressed by any transformation as functions of 3 n + k othe'r marks of position, n 2 ...a n + kn which must therefore be connected by k equations of condition, PROFESSOR HAMILTON ON A GENERAL METHOD IN DYNAMICS. 263 O = P1(415 42' -** ?3 n+k) ' o = P2 ('21) 425 * * * '/3n+k)' .

(47.) in which T = m (x' +1y7 + z'7),.(48.) and T, = 1 (ai'2+ + y, z2) m.. . . . (49.) By this known decomposition, the whole living force 2 TI of the system is resolved into the two parts 2 T, and 2 T,, of which the former, 2 T,, may be called the relative living force, being that which results solely from the relative velocities of the points of the system, in their motions about their common centre of gravity x, Y, ,,a; while the latter part, 2 T,,, results only from the absolute motion of that centre of gravity in space, and is the same as if all the masses of the system were united in that common centre. At the same time, the law of living force, T = U + H, (6.), resolves itself by the law of motion of the centre of gravity into the two following separate equations, T.= U + H. (50.) and T. H. (5 1.) H-I, and H,, being two new constants independent of the time t, and such that their suM HI + H., = H. (52.)

We find, therefore, for thle relative motion of a system about its own centre of gravity, equations of the same form as those which we had obtained before for the absolute mnotion of the samne system of points in space. And we see that in investigating such relative motion only, it is useful to confine ourselves to the part V, of our whole characteristic function, that is, to the relative action of the syistem, or accumulated living force of the motion about the centre of gravity; and to consider this part as the characteristic function of such relative motion, in a sense analogous to that which has been already explained. This relative action, or part V,, may, however, be otherwise expressed, and even in an infinite variety of ways, on account of the six equations of condition which connect the 6 n cenltrobaric coordinates; and every different preparation of its form wtill give a differentt set of values for the six multipliers x1 i2 ?.3 A1 A2 A3. For example, we mnight eliminate, by a previous preparation, the six centrobaric coordinates of the point n; from the expression of V1, so as to make this expression involve only the centrobalic coordinates of the other n(1 points of the systen, and then we should have and therefore, by the six last equations of the groups (M'.) and (N1.), the multipliers would take the values =to uXrnselvY tth part i of =orwl ch2a= ra,,,it 3ic .

We might also express the relative action V,, not as a function of the centrobaric, but of some other internal coordinates, or marks of relative position.

Cf(66.) For all such transformations of w V, it is easy to establish a rule or law, which may be called the law of var~ying relative action (exactly analogous to the rule (B1.)), namely, the following: Y-VI= :N;. ( {) ;5 21(a5eo) t e, + t l H. + E. x, 8 p, + . Al, ;D . (V.) which implies that we are to express the half T. of the relative living force of the system as a function of the rates of increase W', of any marks of relative position; and after taking its variation with respect to these rates, to change their variations to the variations of the marks of position themselves; then to subtract the initial fromn the final value of the result, and to add the variations of the final and initial functions A (D,, which enter into the equations of condition, if any, of the form pA 0, 0P, = 0, (connecting the final and initial marks of relative position,) multiplied respectively by undetermined factors x, A,; and lastly, to equate the whole result to 8 V1 t 8 H-1, -1 being the quantity independent of the time in the equation (50.) of relative living force, and V, being the relative action, of which we desired to express the variation. It is not necessary to dwell here on the demonstration of this new rule (V1.), which may easily be deduced from the principles already laid down; or by the calculus of variations from the law of relative living force, combined with the differential equations of the second order of relative motion. PROFESSOR HAMILTON ON A GENERAL METHOD IN DYNAMICS. 271 But to give an example of its application, let us resume the problem already mentioned, namely to express b V, by means of the 6 n -5 independent variations b H,. For this purpose we shall employ a known transformation of the relative living force 2 T,, multiplied by the sum of the masses of the system, namely the following: 2T11m=1 . in { (xIis xk)2 + (y/i Yk)k2 +(Z'i Z'k)2} (67.) the sign of summation ' extending, in the second member, to all the combinations of points two by two, which can be formed without repetition. This transformation gives, by (66.), 2T,lm =_m 1,. m (U2 + I2 + 2) Mi {M, ( k)2 + (ni t')2 + (t'i I)2}; J . (68.) the sign of summation 1, extending only to the first n -1 points of the system. Applying, therefore, our general rule or law of varying relative action, and observing that the 6 n -6 internal coordinates t ac 3 y are independent, we find the following new expression: WV, = g8tIH+ mn.N { -os'bs + w' -0-i 31 + t'r -'Wr) + $,.m mk {(Wi-ck) (hr ck) + (fi31k) (it I) + (r' -rk) (tri-zrk)}) which gives, besides the equation (01.), the following groups: a m m ( V n* r * m (j7) = ni (XI.) ani ~i-),=mn a8 '= '. .m (~it-) = Ms t Xm )n and -V, . .')

And to obtain, with any set of internal or relative marks of position, the two partial differential equations which the characteristic function V, of relative motion must satisfy, and which offer (as we shall find) the chief means of discovering its form, namely, the equations analogous to those marked (F.) and (G.), we have only to eliminate the rates of increase of the marks of position of the system, which determine the final and initial components of the relative velocities of its points, by the law of varying relative action, from the final and initial expressions of the law of relative living force; namely, from the following equations: T.= U + HI) . ( . . . . . . . . . . . . .0.) and To.-U. + Hi *. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . (70.) The law of areas, or the property respecting rotation which swas expressed by the partial differential equations (P.), will also always admit of being expressed in relative coordinates, and will assist in discovering the form of the characteristic function V,; by showing that this function involves only such internal coordinates (in number 6 n 9) as do not alter by any common rotation of all points final and initial, round the centre of gravity, or round any other internal origin; that origin being treated as fixed and the quantity Hi as constant, in determining the effects of this rotation. The, general problem of dynamics, respecting the motions of a free svstem of n points attracting or repelling one another, is therefore reduced, in the last analysis, by the method of the present essay, to the research and differentiation of a function V,, depending on 6 n 9 internal or relative coordinates, and on the quantity II,, and satisfying a pair of partial differential equations of the first order and second degree; in integrating which equations, we are to observe, that at the assumed origin of the motion, namely at the moment when t = 0, the final or variable coordinates are equal aV to their initial values, and the partial differential coefficient As' vanishes; and, that at a moment infinitely little distant, the differential alterations of the coordinates have ratios connected with the other partial differential coefficients of the characteristic function V,, by the hlw of varying relative action. It may be here observed, that, PROFESSOR HAMILTON ON A GENERAL METHOD IN DYNAMICS. 273 although the consideration of the point, called usually the centre of gravity, is very simply suggested by the process of the tenth number, yet this internal centre is even more simply indicated by our early corollaries from the law of varying action; which show that the components of relative final velocities, in any system of attracting or I tv repelling points, may be expressed by the differences of quantities of the form I : and therefore that in calculating these relative velocities, it is advantageons to introduce the final sums 1 r x, E my, I n zm and, for an analogous reason the initial sums In a, I m b, I in c, among the marks of the extreme positions of the system, in the expression of the characteristic function V; because, in differentiating that expression for the calculation of relative velocities, those sums may be treated as constant. On Systems of two Points, in general; Characteristic Function of the motion of anti Binary System. 13. To illustrate the foregoing principles, which extend to any free system of points, however numerous, attracting or repelling one another, let us now consider, in particular, a system of two such points. For such a system, the known force-fiunction U becomes, by (2.), U1 = Mtl M2 f (7') ......... (7 1) r being the mutual distance r= (xl -2)2 +(y1-y2)2 +(z2.7. r = a/ q 9;-D v i , In . .2 . .

It results from the foregoing remarks, that this quantity p is constant also in the sense of being independent of the time, so as not to vary in the course of the motion and that the condition (113.), connecting this constant with r ro a a, is the equation of the plane relative orbit; which is therefore (as it has long been known to be) an ellipse, hyperbola, or parabola, according as the constant a is positive, negative, or zero, the origin of r being always a focus of the curve, and p being the semiparameter.

(108.) for the complete determination of the characteristic function of the present relative motion, it remains therefore to determine the two variables v, and e,, as functions of r ro ,, or of some other set of quantities which mark the shape and size of the plane triangle bounded by the final and initial elliptic radii vectores and by the elliptic chord. For this purpose it is convenient to introduce this elliptic chord itself, which we shall call + r, so that = r 2 + r2+2rrocos;. (109.) because this chord may be expressed as a function of the two variables v,, e,, (involving also the mean distance a,) as follows. The value (106.) for the angle a, that is, by (95.), for 000, gives 0 2 tan { .1-e t I } = (110.) -a being a new constant independent of the time, namely, one of the values of the polar angle 0, which correspond to the minimum of radius vector and therefore, by (106.), rcos (0 w) a (cosv e), rsin(0) = an7i 2sinv { r 0cos(00 z)= a(cosvoe), ro sin(00-.-. ) = a e/j.e2sin vo xpressions which give the following value for the square of the elliptic chord: PROFESSOR HAMILTON ON A GENERAL METHOD IN DYNAMI1CS 283 r2={r coS (-CS)-r (co ( r)}2 + {r sin (0-)-ro Sin (0 -)}2 a2 {(cos v -cos vO)2 + (1 e2) (sin v sin v0)2} L =.4 a2 sinv4U2 { (sin )2+ (1e2 (cosU + Uo)2} (112.) 4 a2 ( -e,2) sin v,2: we may also consider r as having the same sign with sin v,, if we consider it as alternately positive and negative, in the successive elliptic periods or revolutions, beginning with the initial position.

And all the properties of the undisturbed elliptic motion of a planet or comet about the sun may be deduced in a new way, from the simplified characteristic function w, by comparing its variation (K8.) with the following other form, a IIT ' 284 PROFESSOR HAMILTON ON A GENERAL METHOD IN DYNAMICS. in which we are to observe that ? = 202+82+2 + 2 +2 + , 2 M By this comparison we are brought back to the general integral equations of the trelatix e motion of a binary system, (89.) and (90.); but we have now the following particular values for the coefficients A, B, C: I at I at I at C 1 at I aw A Cy-8+ y 8; ' .

We shall not enter, on this occasion, into any details of such application; but we may remark, that the circumstance of the characteristic function involving only the elliptic chord and the sum of the extreme radii, (besides the mean distance and the sum of the masses,) affords, by our general method, a new proof of the wellknown theorem that the elliptic time also depends on the same chord and sum of radii; and gives a new expression for the law of this dependence, namely, La to .

We i nay remark also, that the same form of the characteristic function of elliptic motion, conducts, by our general method, to the following curious, but not novel property, of the ellipse, that if any two tangents be drawn to such a curve, from aly common point outside, these tangents subtend equal angles at one focus; PROFESSOR HAMILTON ON A GENERAL METHOD IN DYNAMICS. 285 they subtend also equal angles at the other. Reciprocally, if any plane curve possess this property, when referred to a fixed point in its own plane, which may be taken as the origin of polar coordinates r, 0, the curve must satisfy the following equation in mixed differences: . ~ ~~~~~~~ t cotan )A = (A + 2)dTr .. .. .....

If then we knew the nine final integrals of the equations of motion of this ternary system, and combined them with the initial form (125.) of the law of living force, we should have ten relations to determine the ten quantities t a'1 UC1 a'g2 112 C2 33 C3, namely, the time and the nine initial components of the velocities of the three points, as functions of the nine final and nine initial coordinates, and of the quantity H, involving also the masses ; we could therefore determine whatever else depends on the manner and time of motion of the system, from its initial to its final position, as a function of the same extreme coordinates, and of H. In particular, we could determine the action V, or the accumulated living force of the system, namely, V _ mlj 2 + (2 2 + z,2)dt+ f(.2d2 +y2+ z'22)dt . 41~~~~~~~~ ~ ~~ or (A4f 7% + m3f': (X/32 + y/32 + Z32) d t, J as a function of these nineteen quantities, x1 y1 S x2 1/2 Z2 Y3 z3 a1 1 C1 a2 b2 C2 a3 4 C3 H; and might then calculate the variation of this function, W V=a 8'X1 X + ayl w Y1 + av 6zl + v ~al 8a + av ~bl + av eI l V a V a V V + 8 X2 a2 + b2 2 !_ + 8 t8 w AX3 + Y8 Y3 + a Z V Z3 + 8a a3 + V b3 + 3 Ca V (3) VI + aE H.

In this manner the difficulty is reduced to determining the relative action V,; and if we introduce the relative coordinates tl XI X13, '1 = 1 Y 9-3, 6l -= Zl %35} **( 02X 2-X3, 82 =Y2 ,Y3' t2 =2 -2s3, and. = al -a3, p2=b2-b3, r2=2-/3 S . . . .

The quantity H, in V,, and the analogous quantity H., in V,1, are mdeed independent of the time, and do not vary in the course of the motion ; but it is required by the spirit of our method, that in deducing the absolute action or original characteristic function V from the two parts V, and V,,, we should consider these two par H and H, of the original quantity H, as functions involving each the nine initial and nine rinal coordinat of the points of the ternary system; the forms of these two tunctions, of the eighteen coordinates and of H, being determined by the two condiotions, I = HI + Hi, H. v * ff * b b a ? ? ? * v v (N4.) However, it results from these conditions, that in taking the variation of the whole original function V, of the first order, with respect to the eighteen coordinates, we may treat the two auxiliary quantities H and H11 as constant ; and therefore that we have the following expressions for the partial differential cofficients of the first order of V, taken with respect to the coordinates parallel to , av V a v+ mnl + + ina V a V+ Mnl + ina ax _az ml1 n + ts2 + m3 ax,aalw8 1 ml + mg, + m. a,, av V, mi2 a Vl a V 8V, In2 V +b mlS ____ _ . -{ a a. aa2 +M + in, (04.) -X2 a6 ml2 +in2+ i oT'8a2 &2 +7fl +2+ n3 8a1a V V _ 8 V, &n3 V av V V V mI a VI, .Inin + -+.8XI +V1 me2 1+ M+s X,,aa8 I n+In2+ mI na J t gether with analogous expressions for the partial differential coefficients of the same order, taken with respect to the other coordinates.

It may not at first sight appear, that this rigorous transformation (B5.), of the partial differential equation (F.), or of the analogous equation (T.) with coordinates not rectangular, is likely to assist much in discovering the form of the part V2 of the characteristic function V, (the other part V1 being supposed to have been previously assumed;) because it involves under the sign of integration, in the term T2, the partial differential coefficients of the sought part V2. But if we observe that these unknown coefficients enter only by their squares and products, we shall perceive that it offers a general method of improving an approximation in any problem of dynamics. For if the first part V1 be an approximate value of the whole sought function V, the second part V2 will be small, and the term TL will not only be also small, but will be in general of a higher order of smallness; we shall therefore in general improve an approximate value V1 of the characteristic function V, by adding to it the definite integral, 2 Q2 296 PROFESSOR HAMILTON ON A GENERAL METHOD IN DYNAMICS.

The three equations (K6.) when the auxiliary constant g(i) is eliminated by the formula (L6.), are rigorously (by our theory) the three final integrals of the three known equations of the second order (M6.), for the relative motion of the binary system (mi m) ; and give, for such a system, the three varying relative coordinates ii 7i ;, as functions of their initial values and initial rates of increase ai Pi rYi 'i 3'i r'i, and of the time t.

PROFESSOR HAMILTON ON A GENERAL METHOD IN DYNAMICS. 307 General introduction of the Time, into the expression of the Characteristic Function in any dynamicalproblem. 23. Before we conclude this sketch of our general method in dynamics, it will be proper to notice briefly a transformation of the characteristic function, which may be used in all applications. This transformation consists in putting, generally, V:=t H +SI . . . . . . . . . . . . . . * . . * (U .

These last expressions (Z7.), are forms for the final integrals of motion of any system, corresponding to the result of elimination of H between the equations (D.) and (E.); and the expressions (Y7.) are forms for the intermediate integrals, more convenient in many respects than the forms already employed. 24. The limits of the present essay do not permit us here to develope the consequences of these new expressions. We can only observe, that the auxiliary function S must satisfy the two following equations, in partial differentials of the first order, analogous to, and deduced from, the equations (F.) and (G.): aS+ as zS2+ aS 2 {as 2 U A8. at 'en a z8J \y 8JX and a s I as 2 as 2 as 2 UO: ~~~~~~~~(B8.) a t + 1 * 2 { 8a) + ( b)+ ( Tc)}?i*******(' and that to correct an approximate value SI of S, in the integration of these equations, or to find the remaining part SO, if S = S 2 S2 P .(C.) we may employ the symbolic equation 308 PROFESSOR HAMILTON ON A GENERAL MxlETHOD IN DYNAMICS. d a I as a> a 8 8 sS a ars a .r dt t ax axw 8w+y ay az az 9 ?
