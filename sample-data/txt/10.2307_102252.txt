[322] An account of the Eclipses or ingresses of Jupiters Satellits into his shadow and such Emersions of them from it as will be visible at the Observatory at Greenwich in the three last Months of this year 1683. sent in a Letter to the Publisher from J. F. Astron. Reg. S I R, I Here send you an account of the Eclipses or Ingresses of Jupiters Satellits into his shadow, and such emersions of them from it as will be visible at the Observatory in the three last moneths of this year; they are calculated from new Tables 1 made this last summer, and I hope so exactly that the Ingresses of the first will seldom be found when observed, to differ above 5 minutes from the time stated, the 3 but little more; the Eclipses of the fourth and second I dare not promise you shall agree so well, for I find their motions evidently intangled with inequalitys, which it will require a long time and many more accurate observations to determine and limit, then I have yet obtained: these Eclipses have been esteemed, and certainly are a much better expedient for the discovery of the Longitude then any yet known, by reason that they happen frequently, and are easily observeable with a Telescope of 12. foot,or for need with one of 8. These Ingresses (and emersions also if visible) from the time till the oposition of the ~ and ~ happen truely on the right hand or in antecedence of the planet, but if they shall be observed with Telescopes of only two Convex glasses which invert the object, they appear on the contrary or left side of him. If these find acceptance with our ingenious friends the Eclipses of the next year shall be imparted early enough to be published in the December Transactions. I am S I R, yours, &c. J.
