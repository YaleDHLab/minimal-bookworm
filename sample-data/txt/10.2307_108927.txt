[ 577 ] XXIII. On the Conditions fJr the existence of Three Egjual Boots, or of Two Pairs of Equal Boots, of a Binary Quartic or Quintic. By A. CAYLEY, F.B.&8 Received November 26, 1867,-Read January 9, 1868. IN considering the conditions for the existence of given systems of equalities between the roots of an equation, we obtain some very interesting examples of the composition of relations. A relation is either onefold, expressed by a single equation U0, or it is, say k-fold, expressed by a system of k or more equations. Of course, as regards onefold relations, the theory of the composition is well known: the relation UV= 0 is a relation compounded of the relations UO, V=-0; that is, it is a relation satisfied if, and not satisfied unless one or the other of the two component relations is satisfied. The like notion of composition applies to relations in general; viz., the compound relation is a relation satisfied if, and not satisfied unless one or the other of the two component relations is satisfied. I purposely refrain at present from any further discussion of the theory of composition. I say that the conditions for the existence of given systems of equalities between the roots of an equation furnish instances of such composition; in fact, if we express that the function (*(x, y)T, and its first-derived function in regard to x, or, what is the same thing, that the first-derived functions in regard to x, y respectively, have a common quadric factor, we obtain between the coefficients a certain twofold relation, which implies either that the equation (*Xx, y)"=0 has three equal roots, or else that it has two pairs of equal roots; that is, the relation in question is satisfied if, and it is not satisfied unless there is satisfied either the relation for the existence of three equal roots, or else the relation for the existence of two pairs of equal roots; or the relation for the existence of the quadric factor is compounded of the last-mentioned two relations. The relation for the quadric factor, for any value whatever of n, is at once seen to be expressible by means of an oblong matrix, giving rise to a series of determinants which are each to be put =0; the relation for three equal roots and that for two pairs of equal roots, in the particular cases n= 4 and n= 5, are given in my " Memoir on the Conditions for the existence of given Systems of Equalities between the roots of an Equation," Phil. Trans. vol. cxlvii. (1857), pp. 727-731; and I propose in the present Memoir to exhibit, for the cases in question n= 4 and n= 5, the connexion between the compound relation for the quadric factor with the component relations for the three equal roots and for the two pairs of equal roots respectively. Article Nos. 1 to 8, the Quartic. 1. For the quartic function (a, , c, -d, e3X, y)4 4 X2 578 PROFESSOR CAYLEY ON THE CONDITIONS FOR THE tXISTENCE the condition for three equal roots, or, say, for a root system 31, is that the quadrinvariant and the cubinvariant each of them vanish, viz. we must have I=ae-4bd+ 3c 0, J=ace-ad'-b2e+2bcd-C3'=0. 2. The condition for two pairs of equal roots or for a root system 22, is that the cubicovariant vanishes identically, viz. representing this by (A, B, 5C, IGD, 5E, F, Gyx, y)6=0, we must have A= a2d-3abc+24' =0 B= a2e +2abd-9ac2+6b2c=0O C= ate-3acd+2b'd =0, D=-ads + b2e -0, E=ade+3bce-2bd2 =0, F=-ae2 -2bde+9cWe-6cd'=0, G=-be' 4 3cde 2d3 =0. 3. But the condition for the common quadric factor is a, 3b, 3C, d =0, b, 3e, 3d, e a, 3b, 3c, d b, 3c, 3d, e and the determinants formed out of this matrix must therefore vanish for (I, J) 0, and also for (A, B, C, D, E, F, G) =0, that is, the determinants in question must be syzygetically related to the functions (I, J), and also to the functions (A, B, C, D, E, F, G). 4. The values of the determinants are1234=3x 1235=3x 1245= 1345=3X 2345-3X + 1 alce -1 a'de -1 a2e2 -1 abe + 1 ace2 3 a'd' +4 abee +2 abde +4 acde -1 ade 1 ab'e +1 abd' +9 acle -3 ad3 3 b'e' +14 abed -3 acVd -9 aed 2 +1 b2de +14 bede 9 aC -3 bMe -9 b'ce -3 bee -8 bd3 8 bd +2 bcd +8 'd +2 bed2 9 ce + 6 bH+ 6 c2ded 5.

The determinants thus vanish if (I, J)=O, that is, for the root system 31; they will also vanish without this being so, if only (3J ac-b2 ad-bc ae+2bd-3c2 be-cd ce-d2. t2I J a2b 6c 2d c and we may omit the first member (3=), since if the remaining terms are equal to each other they will also be = The equations may then be written 8 ac _b2, ad-bc, ae+2bd-3c2, be-cd, ce-d2 1=? a, 2b 6c , 2d, e and the ten equations of this system reduce themselves (as it is very easy to show) to the seven equations (A, B, C, D, E, F, G)=O, which, as above mentioned, are the conditions for the root system 22. 8.

Between the expressions 2, 35, &c., and 1234, 1235, &c., there exist relations the form of which is indicated by the following Table: Q~~~~~~~ R f Gm n m c 6 a a d c b ab< e d c b a c a a y e ed c b a t d c b hba a a 6 f e d c b a e d C c c b a a a I~~~~~~~~~~~~ f e d e b a flee C ddbcb ba aaa f | | e d c b a e f d de e b a a a | d c 6 a f e e d d c 6 f e d fe e f f ef c b f f e e d ffe viz. these relations are of the form H ()e+( )0'j3+()aC5 + )a.1234 -0, ( ( )d3 +( )bC + ( )a]3 +( )b.1234+( )a.1235=0, &C. where the brackets () denote numerical coefficients, determinate as to their ratios. 5 84 PROFESSOR CAYLEY ON THE CONDITIONS FOR THE EXISTENCE 15. Assuming the existence of these relations, we have for the determination of the numerical coefficients in each relation a set of linear equations, which are shown by the following Tables, viz. referring to the Table headed cG, 6Z, at, a.1234, if the multipliers of terms respectively be A, B, C, X, then the Table denotes the system of linear equations o A + 3B + 33C + OX=0, 3 A +0 B -102C -16X-0 &c., that is, nine equations to be satisfied by the ratios of the coefficients A, B, C, X, and which are in fact satisfied by the values at the foot of the Table, viz. A: B: C: X=66: -11: +1: +6. There would be in all fourteen Tables, but as those for the second seven would be at once deducible by symmetry from the first seven, I have only written down the seven Tables; the solutions for the first and second Tables were obtained without difficulty, but that for the third Table was so laborious to calculate, and contains such extraordinarily high numbers, that I did not proceed with the calculation, and it is accordingly only the first, second, and third Tables which have at the foot of them respectively the solutions of the linear equations. 16. The results given by these three Tables are, of course, 66ca110b]+ 1aC+p6a.1234-0O 330dZ+110c3-55bC+9aM-105 a.1235=0, +266478575 e2 -617359490 dB3 +144200810 cl + 9656911 bD + 9090785 at -721004050 c.1234 + 90914175 b.1235 -160758675 a.1245 + 11559295 a. 1236=0.

And the remaining seven Tables might of course be deduced from these by writing (,f e, d, c, b, a) instead of (a, b, G, d, e, f), and malting the corresponding alterations in the top line of each Table. 18. The equations =0, 3-0= 0 =0 consequently establish between the fifteen functions 1234, 1235, .. 3456 a system of fourteen equations, viz. the first and last three of these are 1234=-0 1235=0 -160758675.1245 + 11559295.1236=0 + 11559295.1456 -160758675. 2356-0O 2456=0, 3456=0. To complete the proof that in virtue of the equations 2I=0, 3=0, .., =0 all the fifteen functions 1234, 1235, ... 3456 vanish, it is necessary to make use of the identical relations subsisting between these quantities 1234, &c.; thus we have a. 1345+4b. 1245+6c . 1235+4d. 1234-0 b . 1345+4c. 1245+6d. 1235+4e . 1234-0, which, in virtue of the above equations 1234=0 and 1235=0, become a.1345+4b. 1245-0 b. 1345+4c. 1245=09 giving (unless indeed ac-b2=0) 1245=0, 1345=0; the equation 1245=0 then reduces the third of the above equations to 1236=0, and so on until it is shown that the fifteen quantities all vanish.
