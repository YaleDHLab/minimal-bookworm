[201] Received January 30, 1767. XXI. Extract of a Letter from John Howard, Esq; F. R. S. to William Watson, M. D. F. R. S. giving some Observations on the Heat of the Waters at Bath. WHEN I had the pleasure of seeing you in London, you thought some explanation of the paper, upon the heat of the Bath-waters, necessary. The observations, I assure you, were made with great care. The three first of them were made at the pump, where the waters are usually drunk. I went several times into the king's, and queen's, baths; and took them, where the springs rise in the king's bath, which is the warmest part, and the most distant from thence the coolest. The pump in that bath corresponded with the upper pump. This I mention; as in the other two baths, the thermometers did not rise, by one degree, so high as in the upper pumps; though I had the pumps worked a considerable time, to warm the pipes. The temperature of the other baths you see in my paper. The hot bath, not being so warm as the king's, at first, surprized me, until I considered their times of filling; and then the comparative slowness of the springs of the hot bath, to those of the king's, accounted for this difference. Read April 2, 1767. The other observations are of various springs, in and about Bath; that near St. James's church is the VOL. LVII. D d coldest. [202] coldest. The springs, at the old and new well houses at Bristol, are very different; but, on repeated trials, I found them so. Observations on the Heat of the Bath Waters.
