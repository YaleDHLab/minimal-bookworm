(37) II. Observations of the Eclipse of the Moon, Octob. 10th. 1725. made at Bristol, by John Burroughs Esq; communicated in a Letter to Mr. Cheselden, Surgeon to St. Thomas's Hospital, F. R. S. T H E cloudy Weather here prevented us from seeing the Beginning of the Eclipse, or of total Darkness; but I observed, pretty exactly, the first Appearance of Light, after the total Darkness, and the End of the Eclipse; and their respective Times are as follows, viz. h ~ ~ Beginning of Light 7 31 20 apparent Time. End of the Eclipse 8 29 30 Some small Time before the renewal of true Light, there appeared a remarkable Brightness upon the Eastern Limb of the Moon, which I am not certain how to account for; at first I reasoned with my self in this Manner; That all the Light which the Moon has, during her total Immersion in the Shadow, is by Rays from the Sun, refracted through the Earth's Atmosphere, and consequently those Rays must be in greater Plenty, near the Edge of the Shadow, than near the Axis. But this does not fully answer the Phaenomenon, because the Light I speak of, was not only upon the Moon itself, (on whose Eastern Limb there was a manifest increase of Light, as she approached the Edge of the Shadow) but it was also diffused about the Edge of the Moon, to a sensible 2 Distance, (38) Distance, which I would certainly have measured, if I had had proper instruments. And if others, who are more skilled in these Affairs, have made the like Observation, I shall no longer doubt of the Moon's having an Atmosphere. Bristol, Feb. 19. 1725. III.
