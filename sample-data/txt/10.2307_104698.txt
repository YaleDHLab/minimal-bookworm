[573] IX. Extract of a Letter from Mr. William Arderon F. R. S. to Mr. H. Baker F. R. S. concerning the hot Weather in July last. Dear Sir, T H I S Letter waits upon you with my Observations on the late hot Weather; which, for 12 Days past, has been here at Norwich the most excessive I ever knew. The Beginning of this Heat was on the 8th of this instant July; on which (tho' the whole Day was cloudy) the Ground was so uncommonly hot, that I could not bear to walk on it long together without much Uneasiness; and many were sensible of the same Inconvenience as well as myself. ReadNov. 22. 1750. On Wednesday the 11th, which was the hottest Day of all, my Thermometer in the Sun's Rays stood 11 Degrees above the Heat of human Blood; and in the Shade, in my House, only 8 Degrees below it. The Distance between Freezing and the Heat of human Blood being divided into 100 Parts. An Inch of Tallow, 6/10 of an Inch in Diameter, liquefied in the Sun in less than 30 Minutes. A Piece of Resin, 5/10 of an Inch in Diameter, became so soft as to be liable to take any Impression in the same time. But, that you may form a better Judgment of the Heat at Norwich, on the said 11th Day of July, and for three Days before, and for 3 Days after, you will see below how Hauksbee's Thermometer stood at different Times in each of those Days. D d d d 2 July [574] Morning 7 33 July 8 Evening 10 25 Morning 7 26 July 9 Evening 2 15 Evening 10 18 Morning 7 24 July 10 Evening 2 11 Evening 10 16 Morning 7 19 Reaum. Fahr. July 11 Evening 2 81/2 = 1026 = 83 Evening 10 16 Morning 7 18 July 12 Evening 2 12 Evening 10 16 Morning 7 18 July 13 Evening 2 12 Evening 10 16 Morning 7 32 July 14 Evening 2 13 Evening 10 29 I observe 3 o' Clock in the Afternoon, when the Sky is clear, is the hottest Part of the Day; but Clouds mostly came on about that time on these Days. Many People here, who judged by their outward Senses only, without paying any Regard to Thermometers, [575] meters, have thought the 11th of June 1748 was hotter: But I imagine the Reason to be, that the Heat this Year came on gradually from Day to Day; whereas in the Year 1748 it was much more sudden; the Thermometer then rising 22 Degrees more in one Day than the preceding; which, consequently, would make the Difference between one Day and another appear the more extrao dinary. But, by my Observations on the 11th of June 1748, Hauksbee's Thermometer stood at 141/2; full 6 Degrees cooler than on the 11th of this present July. I am, S I R, Norwich, July 23. 1750. Your most humble Servant, William Arderon. P. S. Several Horses have dropped down dead under their Masters, overcome by this violent Heat.
