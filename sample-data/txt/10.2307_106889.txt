VII. The Latitudes anc tongituEles of several laces in Denmark; calczzlatedfrom the Trigonometrlcal Operations. By Thomas Bugge, F. R. S. Regius Professor of Astronomy al Copenhagen. Read Jalauary 9s 794b ft'll_ HE ' geographical surveying of Dennlark was begun in the rear z76e Tlle foundations-of-geographical maps are the trigonometrical operations, or great trianglesf wllose bases uTere measured svith (Ieal rods. The angles of the triangles were observed w-ith a circular instrument of z foot radius S the divi sions of this instrumerlt are double in go and 96 degreesb With this instrument the angles may be observed to a lesserror than S", alad the sum of all the angles in every triangle very seldom have had a difference of 15" from 180 degrees. For this reason the bases, measllred at several places in Seland and Jutland75 have very well agreed with the corresponding sides, computed through a long series of triatlgles, begurl from theobservatory at CopenhageIl. I believe that a distance, found by those trigonometrical operatiolas, is to lJe dependecl upon to 2 oooolth part of the whole. I beg leave to observe, that the Danish astronomers alld geographers, for gl years, hate been before hand in making use of circular instruments, which now begin to be of a more general use in astrorlozzlical . . . \ ad geographical observations. The royal observatory at Copenhagen has, sitce the year 178zn beerz adorlaed Witll a C; s: 43 3 Mr. BUGGE}S Latitades and Longitubtescircular instrument of 4 feet radius, which at least at that time was the only circular instrument of that size. By the trigonometrical operations, the merldian of=CopenF hagen, and of several other places, and a perpendicular to the rneridian of the observatory, are draw:zl. The special position of villages, farms, and cottages, the situation of the coas-t9 woodsf rivers, ponds, moors, roacls, are laid down by the plain table, orl a scale of 20O0 Danish or Rhenish feet to one decimal inch. After a reduction to Wth part, toa scale of o Danisl mile to : e | inches, we have pulilished g geographical maps, which, as well for the geometrical exactness, as for the beauty of engra^7ing, seem not to be unworthy of the approbation of torelgners. I have described the izastrutnentsn and the methods of our $eometrical surveyillg, and ot the trigonometrical operations, ill a trea-tise published in tile Dalaish lallguage at Copenhagen 177g) and translated into the Gerinan by Major ASTER at Dresden, 1787. II1 this paper I only shall lay before the Royal Society a new method 3f coml?uting the longitude and tlle latitude of places, laid dow by trigonometrical opera tions. Let ESIH (Tab.VIII.) be an ellipsis; EH llalf the less axiss IH half the greater axis X A the observatory at Copenhagen; AV its vertical linethe angle V the complement to the latitude of the observatory. tThen by t1-1e llature of the ellipsis.AV = (il; sln zHv + e; cos; v) I AN is a great circle, perpendicular to tlle meridian of Copenhagen. The tangent to the same meridian AF =AV x tang. V.

For the first series of wiangies may be taken the parallels divided into small parts AB c BC o CD; and for the second series may be talen the merIdlan GD; because the arches of those circles are known by the triangles, and^computed-fiom the trigenometrical operations.
