[ 399 1 XIX. On the Algebraic Expression of the number of Partitions of which a given number is susceptible. By Sir J. F. WV. HiERSCHEL, Bart., K.H., F.R.S. Received April 18,-Read May 16, 1850. (1.) BEFORE entering on the investigation which forms the object of this communication, it will be necessary to recall to recollection some general properties of the differences of the powers of the natural numbers, or of the numbers comprised in the general expression A"' 0", which I have elsewhere demonstrated, as well as to establish certain preliminary theorems by the aid of those properties, which will be useful in the progress of the inquiry. I shall employ throughout the separation of the symbols of operation from those of quantity, as respects A and 0, in the manner followed in my paper "On the Development of Exponential Functions, published in the Philosophical Transactions, vol. cvi. p. 25 (1816), and further extended in its application in my " Collection of Examples of the Applications of the Calculus of Finite Differences," appended to the translation of LACROIX'S Differential and Integral Calculus in 1820*, to which paper and collection the reader is referred for the demonstration of the fundamental properties in question.

Furthermore, it will be necessary to recall in what follows, the notation and conventions of Icirculating functions,' as explained in my paper on that subject, published in the Philosophical Transactions for 1818, vol. cviii. p. 144. Denoting by sx the sum of the xth powers of the sth roots of unity divided by s9, or the function ( +P1 +r'+&c.), where a, fy, &c. are those roots, any function of the form A..s.+B,.Sx-1+....Nx.sx-s+1 will circulate in its successive values as x increases by units from 0: being expressed by Ax when x is a multiple of s; by BI, when xI is such a multiple, and so on. If AZ, Bx, &c. be simply constant, the function may be termed a periodic one, since it assumes in periodic and constantly recurring succession the values A, B, C....N, A, B, &c. ad infnitum. If s be a specified nunmber, as 2, 3, &c., we shall not the less use the notations 2., 3x, &c. to express the respective quantities 2(Mx+Wx),1 (Mx+f3+rX), &c., where a, [3, &c. are the corresponding roots of unity. And we shall accordingly NUMBER OF PARTITIONS OF WHICH A GIVEN NUMBER IS SUSCEPTIBLE. 401 have the following general relations, in which P., and Q, denote any circulating functions, such that QretAx . sx+ Bx .s~ + C~s.x2 + &c...

And the same holds good for any number of indices x, y, z, &c. (8.) If n and s be prime to one another, we shall also have nx+n-8+nx-2s+ ...,fnx_1(8)s=1. .(20.) For if the series of numbers 0, s, 2s, .... (nl)s be divided by n, they will leave s remainders, all different, and all less than n, so that among them will be found, though not in the same order, all the numbers 0, 1, 2, .... (n1), whence, since nxnx-nm-ithe truth of the equation (20.) is apparent. (9.) If n be a multiple of s, or n=ts, then nX+n rs+nx-2s+..i .-_ls =5*s. (21.)

To find the product or other functional combination of circulating or periodic functions having different periods of circulation, they must be [educed to a common period.; Th'us, if m represent the product of s and t dlividled by their greatest coinIMDCCCL.3 402 SIR J.

The readiest way in practice and the surest way to avoid mistakes, which in complex cases are very likely to occur, is to proceed by a much easier process, as in the following example. Suppose we would express the product of the three periodic functions Px=2x+2.2x-j, Qv=3x+2.3x-1+3.3X-21 1R=4x+2.4x-j+3.4x-2+4.4x-3 the product of 2, 3, 4 divided by the greatest common measure of 2 and 4 is 12, which will therefore be the' period of the product. Write then the several coefficients in order as follows: for Pt 1,2;1 2; 1 2; 1, 2; 1, 2; 1 2; &c. Q, 1,2, 3; 1, 2, 3; 1, 2, 3; 1, 2, &c. R. 1,2, 3, 4; 1, 2, 3, 4 ; 1, 2, 3, 4;&c. 1, 8, 9, 8, 2, 12, 3, 16, 3, 4, 6, 24, and we shall have for the product 12x+8.12.l1+9.12.v2+8 .l12.v3+2.12,v4+ . ........ 24.12_1VIf the signs of the coefficients, or any of thern, differ, they must be of course annexed to each, and the proper sign affixed to each product. (12.) If we denote by s the integer part of the quotient of any number x divided by another s, then, universally, =:=:.S&x+ s -.(23.) X1 1 ' S-.sv+ 1 .sx+2 .sx2+. and therefore the remainder, in the same division, is expressed by x -.-s.===0.t sg+l .,+2 *~s~ Jr ....s-1 ~.sx-sel , . . . . .(24.) (13.) If, again, wve would express the integer part of the quotient in the division of NUMBER OF PARTITIONS OF WHICH A GIVEN NUMBER IS SUSCEPTIBLE. 403 by a second integer division t, we have, putting y for so _ t .y +I . tY + * **(-1 ) * tY-tl+1 = 0t{?8X+ I *SX-1 + * ( ('-. I)SX-S+1 tY+.t-I .......(t-i).ttY };*.(25.) and so on as far as we please. (14.) The periodic function O.t+l .t,-,+ &c. depends implicitly on x, because y is dependent on ax. Its value however (as well as that of any other implicit periodical function) is very easily obtained by following out the process explained in (art. 11). Suppose, for example, we had the more general periodic function of y, qy=a.tY ofb.tY-j+....h.tY-t+1. Then we may write down the successive values of x, y, qy in order thus: x 0,1,2, 12... (s-I); 1, sl, .... (2s-) ; 2s,.....; , qy a,a a, a, ... a;b, b, b ..... bc . , a Thus we see that qy is a periodical function of x, having for its period st instead of either s or t separately, the first s coefficients being all alike and each a, the next s all alike and each = b, and so on; or q{=a{(st) 2+ l } +t*_.-s @ +b{(s1 +. t) }.+ tt ++ * ..(sl), ts+l} ...... (26.) (15.) Hence we are enabled to express the value of t explicitly as a periodic funct tion of x; for by equation (25.), if we put st=n, _=--0 *Sew , +I ** I S-1 * S+l t Un{n . . But by equation (21.) we have to =nX+n_-s+f-2s+..,,lx-ns+s so_ -n,,+Zts, ...nls, &c.,; and by the equation (26.) of the foregoing article, ty-I =nx-s+flanx-s-1? + * * n2,+l t2=n72 ,,-2+ n,-2s,-+* .. .J?

As regards s, in every part of the following investigation it will be regarded as a mere given integer number, so that the coefficients in s will come to be calculated in absolute numbers and need give no further concern. It is otherwise with those in x, which mix themselves up with the x contained in p(x+s1) and its differential coefficients in a way requiring special examination, as functions of an independent variable. Let us therefore consider the term multiplied by d p(x+s1) in the development of p(x+sI-s.0).

We shall now proceed to the more immediate object of this paper, viz. the expression of the number of ways in which a given number x is susceptible of partition, the number of parts being given. Let s be the number of parts into which x is to be divided, and let SIJ(x) represent the number of s-partitions of which it is susceptible. It'is evident then that if s=1 there is but one possible, so that in all cases '11(x) = 1 If s=2, the partitions stand thus: lx-1; 2,x-2; 3,x-3;, ... whose number is x. Therefore we have If s=3, the partitions so grouped as that none shall be twice repeated, will stand as follows:ln 1, x-2 2, 2, x-4 3, 3 x-6, &c. 1, 2, x-3 2, 3,X-5 &c. 1, 3, x-4 &c. &c. The first column will consist of all the possible bipartitions of x1, each associated with 1, and their number is therefore IH(1). The second will consist of the bipartitions of x-2, exclusive of (1, x-3), each associated with 2. Their number therefore will be identical with the total number of bipartitions of x-a4, because, so far as the number of cases is concerned, it matters not whether we consider x-4 as parted into (1, X-5), (2, x-6), &c., or x-2 as parted into (2, x-4), (3, x-5), &c., the-reason of which will be obvious Onl trying any particular case. The number of termns therefore in the second column will be 21-1(x-4). In like manner that in the thlir~d will be 211(X-7), the bipartitions of x-3 beginning with (3, x-6), being MDCCCL.3 410 SIR J. F. W. HERSCHEL ON THE ALGEBRAIC EXPRESSION OF THE identical in number with those of x-7, beginning with (1, x-8), and so on. Thus we have '11(x )=2I1(x1)?2TH(x-4) +2(x7) + &c. Next, with respect to the number of terms to which the right-hand member of this equation is to be continued: it will be that of the columns, which will continue without repetition so long as the number x-2m in the first combination (mi, mn, x-2rn) of any one of them. shall be not less than m, or so long as x-3m shall not be negative. Hence we must have m= 3-, since the next greater value of m, viz. M-=?+ 1,will give the tripartition (+1, =+l, x-23--2). Now x cannot exceed 3.x by more than 2, so that x-2 3 -2 cannot exceed x, and must therefore be less than x + 1. Hence 3 3' 3 we conclude that the number of tripartitions is derived from that of bipartitions by the equation 11I(X) =2r1(X -1)+21(X4)+.211(X -7) ....to terms. 3 (27.) Applying a similar reasoning to the higher cases, we shall find as follows s s-1 s_1 s_1 X fl(x) = l(x 1 ) + (x -s-1) + (x2s 1 ) .. .--terms; . . . . (42.) a relation which, with many others of greater generality, has also been arrived at by Mr. WARBURTON. (28.) Suppose now we set out from the equation 1f(x)= 1, and proceed to derive from this value those of 211(X), '11(X), &c. in succession. It will be apparent from the course of the foregoing investigations, and from the nature of circulating functions, that the general expression for I(x) must consist of two portions, the one non-periodical, a function of x, and which may be represented by @(x), the other periodical or circu.lating, which we may denote by Qt, so that we shall have in general to consider the s-1 following form of l1(x), S-1 1l(x) =@(x) + Q fromn which to derive the value of 11(x). When we substitute this in the general expression (equation 42.), we get s 1(x)= ] ) + p(x-s1) +. . . ... (y terms) +QX_1+QXS-1+ ..... (y terms), where y= -. Now with respect to the first portion of this, if @(x) in any one case be a rational integral function of x, it will be so in all subsequent cases, as is evident from the course of the preceding investigations. This part of 11(x) then has been already dealt with, and its complete expression is X?Y of equations (34. 35.), or (38. 39.). NUMBER OF PARTITIONS OF WHICH A GIVEN NUMBER IS SUSCEPTIBLE. 411 (29.) We have therefore now only to consider the remaining portions, which we shall call Z, viz. Z=Q I+Q + Q +. . .y terms, Qx may represent any circulating function. Suppose it to be such that Q-=X (x).m +%1(x).mn +.....X-l(X) MX-M+11 and let any term of this, as y(x)m -i (which for brevity we will write simply z(x).mn,, putting z=x-i), be separately considered. Let R be the portion of Z which originates from this term. Then R=zC ) .m~+X(x-s) .m-8+X(x 2s) .m_ .(y terms). Let ts=n be the first multiple of s, which is also a multiple of m. Then after t terms the value of m, m &s &c. will recur, and therefore R resolves itself into t separate series, as follows: R=m{jX(x)+X(x-n)+X(x-2n)+... Q-t +1+ terms} {(*-s)+x( -n-s) + ...

The problem, "In how many ways can a given number be constructed," is reduced by the author of a short but interesting paper in the Cambridge Mathematical Journal, iv. p. 87*, to the integration of the equations of differences uxy ,uxx+, and u,, -uX-Y Y=UX-l y-ll which last equation corresponds to the case where it is required to find in how many ways x can be composed of numbers none greater and not all less than Y. The analogy of this problem with that here treated is obvious, the function ux, being in effect identical with that which in the above notation would be expressed by 11(x), y corresponding to our s. Accordingly, as far as y=4, to which limit only the inquiry is there extended, the results are identical (the mode of expression excepted) with those of our equations (49.), (50.), (51.)t. The method there pursued (by the successive integration of equations of differences) would of course continue to afford similar results, but without some systematic processes of notation, transformation and reduction, such as those delivered in the foregoing pages, would speedily become too complicated to be followed out, though the sort of form which would ultimately be assumed by the result seems to have been clearly apprehended. Observing that in the cases of y=2, 3, 4, the results express in fact the nearest integers to certain rational fractions, such as 2in the c o3 f=2 , r3+32-9X 12t case o y=3, 2 (x even) and 2 (x odd) when y=4, it is suggested that " probably this simple species of description might be continued." This, on examination of the value above given, when y or s=5, appears to be the case, but for higher values it will be necessary to enlarge the terms of the description, so as to take in circulating functions of higher orders, and with more complicated coefficients. To make this apparent, suppose s=6. Then, without going into the whole calculation (which however would not be materially more complicated than for s=5, and would lead, as in that case, to a final period of 60, only not reducible to the sum * It bears no name, but I have reason to believe it to be the production of Professor DEMORGAN. t Mr. 'WARBURTON has also obtained expressions for the number of partitions as far as 4, and his results, mnulatis mutandis, agree with the above. 422 SIR J. F. W. HERSCHEL ON PARTITIONS. of lower periods), it is easy to see, that besides a non-periodic portion of 5 dimensions in x, and a periodic one with 60 constant coefficients, there will also be a circulating portion of the form ax. 6 t.6~+ b. . .J 6t whose coefficients may rise to the second dimension in x. In fact, if we execute the calculation of this portion by the foregoing processes, we find for the values of the coefficients 4500x2+ 15750x 3209x a 'e2=0; b$=d=-o 172800 172800 With regard to the constant coefficients of the periodic portion, it is easy to see, from the manner of their formation, that they must all fall very far short, in numerical magnitude, of the half of 172800, so that the whole effect of this periodical part does, in effect, go to adjust the final value to the nearest integer of the rational fraction arising from the assemblage of all the terms in x, and a similar reasoning will apply in all cases. (42.) The number of partitions of which a given number x is susceptible, admitting 0 into them as a component part, is the sum of the number of I-partitions, bipart'itions, tripartitions .... up to s-partitions. It may therefore be found, by adding together all the values of H(Z), from s= 1 to s=s inclusive. But it may also be obtained by formulae in all respects similar to those above demonstrated; for if we take HIs(x) to represent this species of partition, we have, if s=Il, 11(x) =I as before. For s=2 the partitions stand 0,x ; 1,x -L 2,-2, ... (-2 + L)terms, that is, 11(x) =I11(x)+111(x-2)+.. . 1 )terms. Similarly, HI(>) =Ha(x) +H,(x-3) + **(+1 ltermsn and so on to 1I1(X) =HX1(x) + 1181(x-s) +*-..
