The Case of Nicolas Reeks, who was born with his Feet turned inwards, which came to rights after being some time used to sit cross-legged. Transmitted from Wm. Milner, Esq; at Poole, to Sir Peter Thompson, Knt. F. R. S. NIcolas Reeks was born in the Town of Poole, 1724. with both his Feet turn'd inwards. His Mother carried him to a Surgeon, who upon Examination gave it as his Opinion that he was incurable. The Boy, as he grew up, was with great Difficulty able to walk, but always on the outward Edge of his Feet and Heels, so that he frequently feel down in walking, one Foot striking against the other. Read Dec. 7. 1749. His Parents being poor, in 1735. the Parish put him Apprentice to Mr. Richard Mocket, of the same Town, Taylor, apprehending it the only Trade he could be fit for as a Cripple. His Shoes were made in a peculiar manner to lace on to his Legs, the Muscles [240] Muscles of which were much smaller than those of Boys of his Age. He lived with his Master, and worked at the Trade, till about 1741. when they began to perceive a manifest Alteration and Turn in both of his Feet; which was brought on without the Assistance of any manner of Art, Application of Plaisters, Oils, or Bandages, till both Feet were turned to their right and natural Situation. He was able to wear his Master's Shoes, the Muscles of his Legs grew larger, his Feet and Legs like other Peoples of his Age; if any Difference, they turned outwards more than others do. In March 1742/3. he ran away from his Master, entered on board a Ship of War as a Marine, and is now living at Portsmouth.
