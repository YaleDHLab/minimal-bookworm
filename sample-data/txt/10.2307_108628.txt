[ 463 ] XXII. On an Element qf Strength in Beams subjected to Transverse Strain, named by the author "1 The Resistance of Flexure."-Second Paper. By WILLIAM HENRY BARLOW, Esp., F.R.S. &c. Received March 12,-Read March 26, 1857. IN my former paper on this subject, I pointed out the existence of an element of strength in beams when subjected to transverse strain, which had been omitted in the generally admitted theory. The forms of beam employed in the experiments described in that paper were only of two kinds, namely, solid rectangular bars, and open beams or girders. In the experiments given in the present paper I have employed other forms, namely, square bars broken on their sides, square bars broken on their angles, round bars, beams of the I section broken with the flanges horizontal, and similar beams broken with the flanges vertical H; the object of these experiments being, to elucidate the general bearing of the subject more clearly, and to determine with greater precision than was attempted in my former paper, the laws which govern this resistance. The following are the results of the experiments in which, for the purpose of more easy reference, I have numbered the several forms of section in continuation of those described in my former paper; and have also included the results of those experiments.

In any bar or beam, supported at the ends and loaded in the centre, Let f represent the ultimate tension*, I the length, W the weight applied in the, centre, d the depth, .and x any variable distance from the neutral axis. Then -d will be the tension at the distance x, and according to the principle of LEIBNITZ, the sum of all these resistances at the moment of rupture will be 5 'dx; * In those materials in which the resistance to compression is less than that of tension, f must be taken to represent the ultimate resistance to compression. 3 P2 468 MR. W. H. BARLOW ON THE RESISTANCE OF FLEXURE and including the equal resistance to compression 2ifd dx, which t;aken between the limits x= 0 and x= , becomes 2fd2 _ _4 In the case of rectangular bars, if the breadth =b, this expression becomes -fid2=I4W.(1.) In girders or bars of other forms, if y= the double ordinate corresponding with the distance x, the general expression will be fyxdx; -and when the form of section is symmetrical above and below the neutral axis, 2 Yfyxd = IW. From this general expression we obtain the following for the several forms experimented upon: In the square bar broken on its angle, if d= half the depth, y= 2(d-x), the complete integral of this between the limits x= and x = d will be f.3 _1W. ..(2.) In like manner, in round bars, if d= half-depth or radius, y=2 V/(d2-x2), z= 3-1416... then the complete integral is .(3.) 4 W. In the open beam, the expression for the resistance is the same as in the rectangular bar, except that here denoting the half-depth by D, and the half-distance between the bars by d, the expression 2Sxdx must be taken between the limits x=d and x=D, which gives 2bf(D3_d) =lW.

This discrepancy and variation will be found to arise from the omission of the resistance consequent on the molecular disturbance accompanying curvature. In my former paper a formula was given by which the difference between the tensile strength and the apparent resistance at the outer fibre could be computed, approximately, in solid rectangular beams and open girders. I now propose to trace the operation of the resistance of flexure, considered as a separate element of strength, and to show its effect in each of the above forms of section. The theory at present acted upon, proceeds on the assumption that there are only two resistances in a beam, namely, tension and compression; but this supposition fails to account, not only for the strength, but also for the visible changes of figure which arise under transverse strain. If abdc (fig. 3) represent the centre portion of a solid rectangular beam before any Fig. 3. Is----*---. ----. _-_3.-;-----------I soh-strain is applied, lcgki is the figure which this portion will assume when subjected to IN BEAMS SUBJECTED TO TRANSVERSE STRAIN. 471 transverse strain, the beam being supposed to be supported at the .centre f, and loaded at its extremities. In this change of figure it will be observed that there are three effects First, an extension of the fibres or particles, commencing at the neutral axis Inmn, and increasing to the upper portion of the beam. Secondly, a compression of the fibres or particles from the neutral axis to the lower portions of the beam; and Thirdly, the planes or surfaces aie and blnd are forced downwards to the distance el, no and f. There are, in fact, two distinct changes of figure z >#at e -, f There is the change produced by the tension and compression, which, if acting alone, would result in the figure efhg; and there is the change produced by curvature, which, if acting alone, would result in the figure lpnorm. The effect produced by the curvature is, to cause the sides or planes bd and ac to descend parallel to themselves; the effect produced by the tension and compression is, to cause these planes to turn about the neutral axis. The combination of these effects is necessary to produce the figure which a beam assumes when placed under transverse strain; and the changes of figure point out distinctly the nature of the resistances. For as it was shown by the measurements taken in the experiments on the neutral axis, that the lines or planes corresponding to ac and ld remained straight, whatever was the amount of their angular motion, it follows that the tensions and compressions will increase in an arithmetical ratio from the neutral axis to the outer portions of the beam. But the effect of flexure causes the planes corresponding to ac and ld to descend an equal extent throughout their surfaces; the resistance to this change of figure will therefore be a force distributed evenly over the whole surface. If abed were a series of horizontal laminag, these two changes of figure might be obtained separately; efhg being the result of the strains applied in the direction of the length, and Inom that of a strain applied at right angles to the length. But if the laminag are all united together, the elastic reaction of the mass causes certain fixed relations to be established between the curvature and the angles formed by the planes which were at right angles to the length, prior to the strain being applied. Of these relations, it is sufficient for the present purpose to point out that which subsists between the degree of extension and compression, and the amount of curvature. 472 MR. W. H. BARLOW ON THE RESISTANCE OF FLE RE Referring again to fig. 3, if b represents any point in the upper surface of a solid beam, before strain is applied, and g the same point when loaded, br* will vary directly as rg. But rg represents the difference between the extension of the fibre, at or nearest the neutral axis, and that at the outer portion of the beam; therefore the resistance to flexure will vary directly as this difference. In the case of the open beam, the resistance to flexure being only due to that of the bar deflected, whereas the ultimate deflection of the beam is equal to that of a solid beam of the same total depth, the resistance of flexure in the open beam will be to that of the solid beam, at the moment of rupture, as the depth of the bar to the half-depth of the beam; and this is also proportional to the difference between the extension of the fibres nearest the neutral axis, and those at the outer portion of the beam. The foregoing consideration of the subject, therefore, points out the following properties as belonging to the resistance of flexure: Ist. That it is a resistance acting in addition to the direct extension and compression. 2nd. That it is evenly distributed over the surface, and consequently (within the limits of its operation) its points of action will be at the centres of gravity of the half-section. 3rd. That this uniform resistance is due to the lateral cohesion of the adjacent surfaces of the fibres or particles, and to the elastic reaction which thus ensues between the portions of a beam unequally strained. 4th. That it is proportional to, and varies with, the inequality of strain between the fibres or particles nearest the neutral axis and those most remote. We are enabled, under the above-mentioned conditions, to arrive at the relation between the straining and resisting forces in any of the forms of section experimented upon, as resulting from the combined effect of the resistances of tension, compression and flexure. Using the same letters as before to represent the tension, weight, length, depth, &c., let p = the resistance of flexure acting as a force evenly spread over the surface of the section. Then, instead of the expression -d, as representing the resistance at the distance x, we shall have, according to the preceding view, the expression and these forces acting as before, the moment will be The sum of these moments, including those above and below the neutral axis, will be 2 d + p xdx, which, taken between the limits x=0 and x=d, becomes 2(3f + l p) d2= I1W. * r, which is not represented in the figure, i4 the intersection of the lines bin, pg. IN BEAMS SUBJECTED TO TRANSVERSE STRAIN. 473 Taking y = the double ordinate corresponding to the distance x, the general expression, when the sections are symmetrical above and below the neutral axis, will be 2SQ +p)yxdx=IIW. From this general expression the following are obtained for the several forms experimented upon:First, in the case of the square or rectangular bar, 2(1f+jp)bd2= 1W.(7.) For the square when broken angleways, (-X + .)d3 .....(8.) For the round bars, (4+ )d3 4w. (9.) For the open bar, since the resistance to flexure depends on the inequality of extension between the part nearest and that most remote from the neutral axis, if d'= the depth of the bar, and D the half-depth of the beam, the resistance to flexure at the moment of rupture will be pD, or multiplied by d'b, d l2 and this resistance acting at the distance D--, we have, for the whole resistance, 26{(D3D 2)f+d (d) p}=4iw.

In the case of section No. 15 (fig. 1), broken with the flanges horizontal, the expression for the centre part will be 2(3sf+ l ) b D'; and for the flanges, 3D +DkD 2) j and consequently for the whole section, 2 (-s3f + Ip)bD 2+2b{ 3 fD(D-2 )@= 1W (1.

It is here used as the measure of the resistance considered as acting evenly over the surface; hence the value of 0, as here employed, will be two-thirds of the difference between the tensile resistance and the apparent resistance at the onter fibre inl the rectangular bar. 3 Q2 476 MR.

And employing the formula used for the section No. 16, we have 2 8631f+42 3476p= 90153; and if p be taken at nine-tenths off, f=15086. The tensile strength thus computed, accords very closely with the quality of metal employed by Mr. HODG:KINSON in that and other experiments made by him at that time on various forms of girders. In the Reports on the ' Strength and other properties of Metals for Cannon,' made by the Officers of the Ordnance Department of the United States Government, some experiments are given upon the transverse strength of square and round bars of cast iron. These experiments were made with very great care by Major WADE, for the purpose of testing various qualities of metals and modes of treatment, by frequent re-casting, and by keeping the metal for various periods of time under fusion. From each experiment, a constant is derived for the purpose of comparing the relative strengths of metal; and in endeavouring to obtain the constant for round iron, Major WADE has employed the usually accepted theory of the transverse strain. He appears, however, to have found that the formula is defective, for he observes at page 21 of the Report,-" A trial was made with cylindrical bars in lieu of square bars. These generally broke at a point distant from that pressed, and the results were so anomalous that the use of them was soon abandoned. The formula by which the strength of the round bars is computed, appears to be not quite correct; for the unit of strength in the round bars is uniformly much higher than in the square bars cast from the same kind of iron." The following are the experiments on the round bars, with those on the square bars from the same metal; and it will be seen, that if the tensile strength of the metal be computed by the formula here given, including the resistance to flexure, the discrepancy pointed out by Major WADE disappears; and the tensile resistance, whether obtained for the round or the square bars, agrees very nearly with that derived ftom the experiments on direct tension under like circumstances. 478 MR.

It will be seen, on referring to the Reports from which the above Tables are taken, that by frequent recasting and keeping the metal under fusion during periods of from three to four hours, an increase of 60 per cent. is obtained; and that the strength of the American iron so treated is more than double that of English under the usual mode of manufacture. The general accordance presented between the value of the tensile resistance, obtained by direct experiment, and that computed by means of the foregoing formulae in so many varieties of form of section, is such as to confirm the view here taken of the laws which govern the action of the resistance of flexure. It remains only to refer to two points connected with it, first, as to the ratio it bears to the tensile resistance. If the metal were homogeneous and the elasticity perfect, it is probable that the resistance of flexure would be precisely equal to the tensile resists ance, instead of bearing the ratio of nine-tenths, as found by experiment. It is evident, however, that it varies in different qualities of metal, and that the tensile resistance does not bear a constant ratio to the transverse strength. The following Table, taken from Major WADE'S valuable Reports, shows, that with the same metal and different modes of casting, an increase of transverse strength is obtained, while a decrease takes place in the tensile resistance.

It is easy to conceive also, that though the resistance of flexure might be supposed to maintain nearly the same proportion to the tensile resistance in bodies similarly consti480 MR. W. H. BARLOW ON THE RESISTANCE OF FLEXURE tuted, as for example crystalline substances, yet great variation may be expected to occur between crystalline and malleable and fibrous substances. The only other point to be referred to is, as to the limit of action of the resistance of flexure. It appears evident that in all the simple solid sections, the points of action of the resistance of flexure are the centres of gravity of the half-section; while in the compound sections it is necessary to compute the centre rib and flanges as for two separate beams in which the resistance of flexure is different, and has its point of action at the centre of gravity of the separate portions. It would appear that the elastic reaction developes this resistance to the full extent, when the section is such that a straight line may be drawn from every point at the outer portion to every point at the neutral axis within the section; but that if the form of section is such that straight lines drawn from the outer fibres, or particles, to the neutral axis fall without the section (as in the case in the compound sections, Nos. 15 and 16), then it must be treated as two separate beams, each having that amount of resistance of flexure due to the depth of the metal contained in it. Resistance of Flexure in Wrought Iron. Although from the fact, that in a cast-iron beam (the section being a solid rectangle) the neutral axis was found to be at the centre of gravity of the section, it might have been inferred that the same would be found in wrought iron; yet it was considered desirable to ascertain it by actual measurement. For this purpose two beams were taken, one of rolled iron, 7 feet 6 inches long, 6 inches in depth, and 14 inch in breadth; the other of hammered iron, 8 feet long, 7inches in depth, and 143 inch in breadth. Holes were drilled at about 6 inches on each side of the centre, or point of application of the strain, for the insertion of the pins of the measuring instrument. The holes were six in number, and placed at equal distances from the upper to the lower side of the beam; and the experiments were conducted in the same manner as those made with the cast-iron beam, and described in my former paper.

The formula 2( If+ )bd2= -, given in the former part of the paper for cast iron, will therefore apply to wrought iron also. The relative values off and p are not so readily ascertained in wrought iron, because the material yields by bending and not by fracture. And another point requires consideration, namely, that the ultimate compressive strain which wrought iron is capable * Previous to these measurements being taken, a weight of 14,093 lbs. was applied on the end, equal to 28,186 lbs. on the centre of the beam, but was reduced to 23,706 lbs. in the centre. The elasticity of the beam had, however, been overcome, as shown by the permanent set and by subsequent experiments on the same beam. MDcccLVII. 3 R 482 MR. W. H. BARLOW ON THE RESISTANCE OF FLEXURE of sustaining is little more than half its ultimate tensile strength. But although there exists this disproportion as regards the ultimate resistances by tension and compression, the force required to overcome the elasticity of the material is nearly the same, whether applied as a compressive or a tensile strain; the difference being, that the force which overcomes the elasticity when applied as a compressive strain, leads to the destruction or distortion of the material; while in the case of the tensile strain, the elasticity may be overcome long before the material yields by absolute rupture. The following experiments, made in Woolwich Dockyard by Professor BARLOW, show the relative weights which overcome the elasticity of the metal when applied transversely, as compared with the weight necessary to produce the same result when applied by direct tension. Three bars, numbered 5, 6 and 7, each 2 inches square, were tested by direct tension; and the strain which was just sufficient to overcome the elasticity of the iron, was found to beTons per square inch of section.

It is, however, desirable that further experiments should be made with this material. Appendix to theforeyoing pages. By PETER BARLOW, Esq., F.R.S. Received March 25,-Read April 2, 1857. Application of the preceding principles to Beams and Girders of non-symnmetrical section. IN beams of symmetrical section the neutral axis corresponds with the centre of gravity, because in that case all the direct forces above and below that point are necessarily equal. But when the section is non-symmetrical, it is requisite, in order to determine the position of the neutral axis, to find that point in the section in which this condition has place, viz. that point below which the sum of all the direct resistances to tension and curvature are equal to all those above that point due to compression and curvature; then to find the sum of the moments of these resistances separately; and finally, to equate them with the straining force. The double-flanged girder with unequal flanges forms a good subject for testing the general application of the principles developed in the preceding pages. In such a girder, let a denote the whole depth of the girder; m the thickness of the middle web; d the depth of the bottom flange; d' the depth of the upper flange; b the breadth of the former, minus m; bI the breadth of the latter, minus m; x the required distance of the neutral axis from the bottom of the girder; X' the distance of the same from the upper face of the girder; t the tensile resistance of the lower fibres; c the corresponding resistance to compression of the upper fibres. Now if we consider the centre rib as carried through the two flanges, the sum of the direct resistances due to the tension of the metal in the middle rib below x will be -smxt, 3nR2 484 MR. W. H. BARLOW ONTHE RESISTANCE OF FLEXURE and the sum of those due to curvature or change of figure, mxep; or calling p=t*, the whole direct resistance of this central web below x will be !mxtb. Again, since the direct tensile resistance of the unsupported flange varies as the distance from the neutral axis, if we consider x as representing a constant quantity, and y any variable distance from the (ydy d neutral axis, bt (taken between Y=x and y=x-d) becomes d+2x bt, the sum of all the direct tensile resistances; the resistance to change of figure being expressed simply by dbt. The total direct resistance below the neutral axis is therefore (+mx+2bd26) t. In like manner, the total direct resistance to compression above the neutral axis is 2mx 2b'd' -T-b 2 )c, which must be made equal to the former expression. But we must here observe, that the compression of the upper fibre c, is to the corresponding tension of the lower fibre t, as x' to x; substituting accordingly, rejecting the common factor t, and observing that x'=a-x, we find 3ma2 + 4d'b'a + d2b-d '2b' x6ma+4(db+ dfb') Having thus determined the position of the neutral axis, we have now to take the moments of these several direct forces both above and below that line, the formula for which are however already given in the preceding pages; that for the lower part of the central web being %mD2t (D now representing x, the distance above found), and that for the unsupported flange being the same as in the open beam, viz. D3-D-d3 d 3D bt+1D(D -1d)dbt. This latter is, however, reducible to a more convenient form for numerical calculation, viz. to (D-dD dbt. We have therefore ~~'2t+ ~ d mD 2t + (Ddbt=R, the resistance below the neutral axis, and 5mD'2c+ (D' 6D') d'1bc=R', the resistance above the neutral axis. * In the preceding paper, Mr. W. H. BARLOW, by obtaining from experiments a mean value of t, has, by means of his original equation for rectangular bars, i. e. (*2t+ -)D2= lw, and his other equations for beams of other forms when broken transversely, endeavoured to find a mean value of 0, and he finds the latter to be to the former as about 9: 10; but from the difficulty of obtaining the mean value of t ~within certain wide limits, I have not hesitated in assuming t and q equal to each other in the case of cast iron. IN BEAMS SUBJECTED TO TRANSVERSE STRAIN. 485 But c: t:: D': D. We have, therefore, for the whole resistance above and below the neutral axis, (R+D R) t. If now we represent by w the breaking weight in any experiment of a beam of given dimensions, and by I the length, or rather the distance between the props, there is obtained the expression (R+ _ ' t4 1Jp an equation from which, when w and l are given, t may be determined. Or if t be previously experimentally determined, w may be found. In order to submit these equations to the test of experience, we have selected from the valuable and extensive series of experiments, by EATON HODGKINSON, Esq., published in vol. v. of the Memoirs of the Literary and Philosophical Society of Manchester, Second Series, a few experiments in which the girders differ most from each other in section, dimensions, and bearing distance; and the results we obtain from the foregoing formula are given in the following pages, with the form of section and linear dimensions. It will be seen that the value of t, or the direct tensile strength of cast iron, thus obtained, falls generally between the limits of t=14,000 and t=16,000. In the Reports of the Commissioners for inquiry into the 'Application of Iron to Railway Structures' (page 9, &c.), there are given the results of about fifty experiments on the direct tensile resistance of one-inch square cast-iron bars, under the direction of Mr. HODGKINSON; these consisted of seventeen different kinds of iron, each set of three bars being of the like quality and manufacture, and in several of these sets, which one might have expected to yield very nearly the same results, the difference is full as great as in the following Table, exhibiting in fact very nearly like numbers. This circumstance will, it is presumed, be considered satisfactory evidence of the general applicability of the principles developed in the preceding pages to cast-iron beams and girders of every variety of section.

In the case of small beams, of the kind employed in the foregoing experiments, a sufficiently near approximation, it will be seen, may be obtained by assuming t14,500 or 15,000, except in peculiar kinds and mixtures of iron; these will generally require a higher number, which must be previously determined. But it appears from the results of experiments by Mr. HODGKINSON, given at page 111 of the ' Appendix to the Report of the Commissioners on Railway Structures,' and others by Lieut.-Colonel JAMES, R.E., page 251, &c., that a much lower value of t must be taken when the thickness of the casting becomes 2, 2-1 or 3 inches, as in large railway girders. Mr. HODGKINSON found, that bars of 1, 2 and 3 inches square, broken on props having the same relative distances, manifested a decrease of strength in the proportion of 1, '780, '756; and Colonel JAMES'S experiments gave a still greater decrease, viz. of 1, '794, '624, and which, by other experiments, he traces to an imperfect crystallization of the interior particles, in consequence probably of the more rapid cooling of the exterior parts. It appears, therefore, that in those large castings commonly employed for railway bridges, it would not be safe to assume t at more than 10,000 lbs. The large girder broken and reported at page 94 by Mr. HODGKINSON, treated as in the preceding cases, gives t=10,533 lbs. Its length was 45 feet; depth, 29 1 inches; the thickness of the lower flange, 2-9 inches; and its weight, 18,000 lbs.
