Part of a Letter from Dr. Nath. Vincent. F. of the R. S. concerning Dr Papin's way of Raising Water. I Have inquired into Dr Papins Problematic Engine for raising Water, in the Transaction of July 1685, and do conclude it may be solved after this manner. Within his Rock C C (see Phil. Trans. Num. 173, Fig. 18th.) there may be a Vessel placed, which shall be made like the Body of a pair of Bellows, or those Puffs heretofore used by Barbers, which being filled with water, a piece of Clock-work put under it may produce the Jetto's; the water being received into the Shell H H, and running thence into the hollow of the Coral E E; may be thereby conveyed into the follicular cavity, in the same quantity it is ejected from the two Emerging [1239] Emerging Tubes; and it shall circulate a hundred or more then a thousand times, according to the going of the Clock-work. If some such account as this will unriddle the Engine, the contrivance of it is owing to a Theory communicated by my self, &c.
