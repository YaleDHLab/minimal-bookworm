(118) An Account of the Extraordinary Cure of a Horse that was Staked into his Stomach; communicated by the Reverend Dr. John Wallis, D. D. R. S. Soc. T H I S is to give you an account of a late Ac` cident, which seems to me very considera` ble, and worth observing. My Son (Mr. ` John Wallis, of Soundess by Nettle-bed in Oxfordshire) ` had a Horse, which this last Summer 1695 (sometime ` after Midsummer, in Harvest-time) leaping over a ` Hedge, chanced to stake himself; and so dangerously ` that the Stake entred far into his Body, and (as ap` peared afterwards) into the Cavity of his Maw or ` Ventricle. What time of the day this happened, we ` know not; but a Boy being sent to fetch home the ` Horse, rode home upon him about four of the Clock ` in the Afternoon, without discerning the hurt, till ` (upon his alighting) he found his own Legs bloody, ` and then discerned the Wound, somewhat behind the ` Fore-legs, a little inclining to one side; and the Stake ` which hurt him, was since found bloody. A Farrier was ` then sent for, (Thomas Bishop the Younger of Wal` lingford, about five miles off,) who chanced not to ` be at home, but was gone to a place more than five ` mile farther; so that he came not to Soundess till after ` ten of the Clock at Night. When he came, he search` ed the Wound; with his Finger, as far as he could ` reach; and brought out with it some Grass, newly ` chewed; whereby he found plainly that it had pierced ` the Coats of the Ventricle,into the Cavity of the Maw; ` and was giving it over as desperate,and that it was to no ` purpose to proceed further. But then considering that ` the Horse could but dye, he resolved to try what might (119) ` might be done. He first (having the Horse on his ` Back) inlarged the Wound in the outer Skin, and ` Rimb of the Belly, (by cutting it wider) that he ` might come at the Maw; where he found the Wound ` to be at least three inches long; he then removed the ` Maw outward,and (while he was preparing his Needle ` and Thred) he ordered one of the Servants (Robert ` Watmore) to cleanse the Maw from what was in it, as ` being less likely to gangrene when empty; who thrust` ing in three Fingers and his Thumb (the Wound there ` being large enough to receive them) pulled out the ` chewed Grass, and what he found there. The Maw ` being thus cleansed, the Farrier sewed up the Wound ` therein, and then thrust the Maw back into the Body; ` and then sewed up the Wound in the Rimb of the Belly: ` The Wound in the outward Skin he did not sow up, ` but only tacked it loosly together about the Middle, ` leaving room on both sides to put in Tints and Medi` cines for the healing of it. The Horse after this con` tinued for some time much indisposed, but in a Month ` or six Weeks time (with careful attendance) the wounds ` were closed and perfectly cured: And the Horse work` ed at the Plow and other Services as before; and hath ` ever since continued sound and well, and was now late` ly sold, (to an Horse-courser) for double the price that ` he cost. I thought fit to give you these particular cir` cumstances, from the Mouth of my Son, and of the ` forementioned Servant, who was concerned in the ` whole process. ` This seems to me a good confirmation of a story we ` had many Years agoe (de Prusso Cultrivoro) of a Prus` sian, who was said (I know not by what chance) to have ` swallowed a Knife into his Stomach; whereupon, his ` side was opened, an incision made in the Stomach, the ` Knife thence taken out, the Wound then sewed up, and ` the Man recovered. Which hath been looked upon as ` a story (120) ` a story very strange and hardly credible; but is ren` dred more credible by this parallel Operation. John Wallis.
