[927] A further list of the Specific Gravitys of bodys, being in proportion as the following numbers. PUmp water. 1000. Fir dry 546. Elm dry 600 Cedar dry 613 Wallnut tree dry 631 Crab tree meanly dry 765 Ash meanly dry, and of the outside lax part of the tree 734 Ash more dry, but about the heart 845 Maple dry 755 Yew of a Knot or root 16 years old 760 Beech meanly dry 854~ Oak very dry, almost worm eaten 753 Oak of the outside sappy part, felld a year since 870 Oak dry,but of a very sound close texture 929 The same tryed another time932 Logwood 913 Claret 993 Moil cider not clear 1017 Sea-water setled clear 1028 College plain Ale the same 1028 Urine 1030 Milk 1031 Box the same 1031 Redwood the same 1031 Sack 1033 Beer Vinegar 1034 Pitch 1150 Pit-Coal of Staffordsh, 1240 Speckled wood of Virginia 1313 P Lignum [928] Lignum Vitae 1327 Stone bottle 1777 Ivory 1826 Alabaster 1872 Brick 1979 Heddington stone, the soft lax kind 2029 Burford stone, an old dry piece 2049 Paving stone a hard sort from about Blaidon 2460 Flint 2542 Glass of a quart bottle 2666 Black Italian marble 2704 White Italian marble tryed twice 2707 White Italian marble of another sort of a visibly 2718 closer texture Block tin 7321 Copper 8843 Lead 11345 Quicksilver 14019 Quicksilver 13593 The last Experiment was tryd with another quantity of quicksilver, which had been used in water in the preceding experiment: however I rather trust the last, for that I found a small mistake (tho'here in the calculation allowed for,) in the weight of the glass containig the Quicksilver in the tryal before. The solids here mentioned, were examined Hydrostatically by weighing them in air and water; but the fluids, by weighing an equal portion of each in a glass holding about a quart. The numbers shew the proportion of gravity of equal portions of these bodys: but if of these bodys we take portions equally heavy, their magnitudes will [929] will be reciprocally proportional to their correspondent numbers. e. g. a cubic foot of water is to a cubic foot of Alabaster in gravity as 1000 to 1872; but a pound weight of water, is to a pound weight Alabaster in magnitude, as 1872 to 1000. So that knowing by the former table, the weight of a cubic foot of water, and by this, the proportion in gravity betwixt water and Alabaster; we may by the rule of 3 find the weight of a cubic foot of Alabaster, and so of any other of these bodys; or we may know their magnitude by knowing their gravity. So that an irregular piece or quantity of these bodys being offered, 'tis but weighing them, and we may know their just magnitude without farther trouble. P 2 A Let
