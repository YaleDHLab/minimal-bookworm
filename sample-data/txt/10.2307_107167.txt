i86 3 X. Concerning the Differences in the magnetic Needle, on Board the Investigator, arising from an Alteration in the Direction of the Shi p's Head. By Matthew Flinders, Esq. Commander of his Majesty's Ship Investigator. In a Letter to the Right Hon. Sir Joseph Banks, K. B. P. R. S. Read March 28, 1805. XVHILST surveying along the south coast of New Holland, in i8oi and 1802, I observed a considerable difference in the direction of the magnetic needle, when there was no other apparent cause for it than that of the ship's head being in a diffrent direction. This occasioned much perplexity in laying down the bearings, and in allowing a proper variation upon them, and put me under the necessity of endeavouring to find out some method of correcting or allowing for these differences; for unless this could be done, many errors must unavoidably get admission into the chart. I first removed two guns into the hold, which had stood near the compasses, and afterwards fixed the surveying compass exactly amidships upon the binnacle, for at first it was occasionally shifted to the weather side as the ship went about; but neither of these two arrangements produced any material effect in remedying the disagreements. * The following Table contains the observations for the 'variation of the compass in which the differences are most remarkable, and from which I shall beg to point out such inferences as I think may be drawn from them.

B bb2 Sr. Mr. -FLINDERS on certain Dfferences It is apparent that some of the observed variations. in. the above, Table are e-j less and others; e greater than the truth; and it may beremarked, that when this error is westward, the! ship's head was east, or nearly so, and when it was eastward the head was in. the opposite direction. When the observations agree nearest with what was taken on shore, or with what may be deemed the true variation, the ship's head was nearly north or south; and a minute inspection of the Table will, favour the opinion, that the excess or diminution of the variation was generally inproportion as the ship's head inclined on either side from the magnetic. meridian. After I hadwell ascertained the certainty of a difference in the compasses, arising from an alteration in the point steered, I judged it necessary, when I wanted a set of bearings from a point where we tacked the ship, to take one set just before and another immediately after that operation: some specimens of these here follow.

Even in the Table of azimuths and amplitudes greater accuracy than one degree must not be looked for; and in ship-bearings 2 or even 3 degrees is not, I believe, too great an allowance for error, unless in very favourable circumstances. Without attending to small differences, it is evident that the bearings correspond with the observations in requiring a less east variation to be applied when the ship's head was easterly, and a greater when it was to the westward, in order to get at the true direction of the object.* When examining the north As a specimen of the plan I followed in protracting such bearings as the above, take the set of April 15, AM, when the true variation appears. to have been 4? E. On the first bearings the ship's head was sic points on one side of the meridian, and on the second it was three points on the other side, the mean is one point and an half on the east side ; now for this one point and an, half I allow il of error, which, as it is on the east side of the meridian, and the variation is easterly, must be subtracted: the variation then to be allowed upon the. mean between the bearings before and after tacking will be 30 E, from which the true bearings will stand as follows April i5th, AM n western part N i s0E 1I1h ls' A peaked hummock N zo E Furthqst extreme from deck S 54 E Centre Qf a naked sandy patch E ol S. In the. same manner upon single sets of bearings I was obliged to allow a variatio n different from what I supposed the true to be, unless the ship's head was nearly north or south: but, that I might proceed as little upon conjecture as possible, I always 190 Mr. FLINDERS on certain D~ffeences and east coasts of New Holland, I always endeavoured to take the angles on shore with a TROUGHTON'S portable theodolite, and to observe for the variation in the same places, that all the errors might be done away or corrected; and as I was frequently fortunate enough to carry on mysurveys in this manner for weeks together, instances that might corroborate or contradict the preceding remarks are neither very numerous or pointed; the following are the most remarkable.

The perplexity arising from, disagreements in bearings was by these means much alleviated, and happy agreements were frequently produced, wheni, without such corrections, there was nothing but, discord. Of the magn etc Needle. 19 In the latter of these observations, the differences arising from a change in the direction of the ship's head is less considerable than in the higher latitudes; indeed, on approaching the line of no variation upon the south coast, the differences in the variation were smaller than before and afterwards; but that these differences shall be greater in a large variation and smaller in a less, both places being equally distant from the magnetic pole, I will not venture to assert. The inferences that I think may be safely drawn from the above observations are as foblows 1 ist. That there was a difference in the direction of the magnetic needle on board the Investigator when the ship's head pointed to the east and when it was directed westward. 2d. That this difference was easterly when the ship's head was west, and westerly when it was east. 3d. That when the ship's headwas north or south the needle took the same direction or nearly so that it would on shore; and shewed a variation from thetrue meridian, vhich was nearly themedium between what it showed when east and when west. 4th. That the error in variation was nearly proportionate to the number of points which the ship's head was from the north, or south. Constant employment upon practice has not allowed me to become much acquainted with theories, but the little information I have upon the subject of magnetism has led me to form some notion cowncerning the cause of these differences and although most probably vague and unscientific, I trust for the candour of the learned in submitting it, as well as theinferences above drawn, to their judgment. Ist. I suppose the attractive power of the different bodies in a ship, which are capable of affecting the compass, to be collected iinto something like a focal pointor center of gravity, 192 Mr. FLINDERS on certain Dfferences and that this -point is nearly in the center of the ship where the shot are deposited, for here the greatest quantity of iron is collected together. 2d. I suppose this point to be endued with the same kind of attraction as the pole of the hemisphere where the ship is; consequently, in New Holland 'the south -end of the needle -would be attracted by it and the north end repelled. 3d. That the attractive power of this point is sufficiently strong in a ship of war to interfere with the action of the magnetic -poles upon a compass placed upon or in the binnacle. If these suppositions are consistent with the laws of magnetism, established by experiments, I judge that they will account for all the differences above noticed; for the interference will necessarily be most perceptible upon a compass when the attractive point is at right angles to the magnetic meridian, that is, when the ship's head is east or west, and will altogether vanish or become imperceptible when the attractive point and meridian coincide, or when the ship's head is north or, south. That the power of this point should become less as the ship increases her distance from the magnetic pole has not indeed entered into myssuppositions; but it may probably be true, and is indeed almost -a necessary consequence of the second supposition. If the above hypothesis, so to call it, be true, it must follow, that the differences in the variation of the magnetic needle, arising from a change in the ship's head, ought to be directly contrary to those before recited, when tile ship is on the north side of the magnetic equator, for the north point of the needle should then be attracted, and the south end repelled. I have no observations which are very decisive upon this head, but those that were taken on board of the magnetic Needle, 193 the Investigator seem to bespeak that it is So; they are as follows.

Thistle These observationss, particularly those of July 28, seem to be decisive in showing that the variation is more westerly when taken upon the binnacle of a ship whose head is westward in north latitude, than when observed in the center of the ship, which is a strong confirmation of the suppositions before given; but the observations on the change of the ship's head are too few to be satisfactory. Almost every sea officer can tell whether he has observed the variation of the compass to be greater when going down the English Channel than when coming up it: and indeed it would be very easy for a ship lying in harbour to ascertain the point beyond controversy. Should this point be well established, I think it would follow, that from, a high south latitude where the differences are great on one side, they are most likely to decrease gradually to the equator, and to increase in the same way to a high north lati.. tude, where they are great on the other side; thus the smaller IDCCCV. C c 194 Mr. FLINDERS on certain Differences differences on the north coast of New Holland will be accounted for. I shall leave it to the learned on the subject of magnetism to compare the observations here given with those made by others in different parts of the earth, and to form from them an hypothesis that may embrace the whole of the phenomena: the opinion I have ventured to offer is merely thevague conjecture of one who does not profess to understand the subject. Some account of the magnetism of Pier Head, upon the east coast of New Holland, may not perhaps be thought an unappropriate conclusion to this Paper. I was insduced to attend to this from the following passage in HAWKESWORTH, Vol. III. p. 12 6. "'At sun-rise I went ashore, says Captain COOK, "and "climbing a considerable hill," Pier Head," I took a view of "the coast and the islands that lie off it, with their bearings "having an azimuth compass with me for that purpose; but I "observed that the needle differed very considerably in its "c position, even to thirty degrees, in some places more, in " others less ; and once I found it differ from itself no less c" than two points in the distance of fourteen feet.* I took up "some of the loose stones that lay upon the ground, and "applied them to the needle, but they produced no effhct; In a set of angles taken near the head of Arnhem north bay, on the west side of the guiph of Carpentaria, I found the needle of the theodolite had been drawn S-o from Its proper direction. The shore consisted of grains of iron ore caked into a stony Lass; and a piece of it, when applied to the needle, drew it 6 or 8 degrees from its direction, but it then swung back to its error of 500 where it was stationary. In Arnhem south bay a small piece of similar store drew the needle of the theodolite entirely round, yet the bearings taken in this place did not show any disagreement from the varnation and bearings taken in th2 ne ghbouring places, where the stone did not produce any sucth ef etc. IL most pl ces Ont shore, where I had occasion to take angles, it w13 my practcf to try 4hIe eff et of a piece of the stone upon the theodolite, ;n order to dtetct the presence of iron ore, as well as on account of my survey. It Of the magnetic Needle. 195 "and I therefore concluded that there was iron ore in the hills, "of which I had remarked other indications, both here and "in the neighbouring parts." On landing at Pier Head I found the stones lying on the surface to be porphyry, of a dark bluish colour; but although I understand thisspecies is usually found to possess some magnetic power, a piece did not produceany sensible effect upon the needle of the theodolite when applied to it.. In the following observations the theodolite always stood about four feet from the ground, that being nearly the lengt of is legs. I first took an extensive set of bearings from the top of the hill, amongst which were two stations whence Pier Head had been before set. The first, called Extensive Mount, distant 81 miles, differed from its back bearing 40 35' to the right, and the second island a, distant 29i miles, differedf 4 ' the same way. I now moved the theodolite three yards to the westward, and the same two objects bore 2? 10t to the right of their back bearing; on moving it three yards to the south-eastward from the first place, they differed 2? to the left ; and on moving the theodolite four yards to the northward, the same two objects bore i? to' to the right of their back bearings. On the folb lowing morning I determined to try the magnetism more particularly. Taking the theodolite and dipping-needle, I landed upon the shore of the Head, whence the top of the hill bore N 500 W, about one-third of a mile. The variation of the theodolite in this place I observed to be 8?' A E, and the commonly happened that no effect was apparent, but yet I could not trust implicitly to the angles, (particularly on the main land,) unless observations for the variation were taken before the instrument was moved, or I had a back bearing of some station where such observations had been made. C c 2196; Mr. FLANDERS on certain Dfferences inclination of the south end of the dipping needle 5e 50', the needle stood vertical when the face of the instrument was S ? E. I then took the follo ving bearings :Extensive Mount 1o80 3o', the same exactly as by back bearing. Double Peak 143 0o'; from hence I rowed round the Head, and landed on a rock, whence the top of the hill bore SSW one-sixth of a mile; Extensive Mount bore 1100 14', the inclination of the dbping-needle o 29', and the needle stood vertical when the instrument faced S S E. Thus the difference was 1-? ifnthe horizontal, and -LO in the vertical direction of the needle. Ascending the hill, I made the following observations on the top: Extensive Mount Iiit so', a island i33' 52', Double Peak 1480 B'; the inclination of the -needle was 5' 20', and it stood vertical at S 3? E. The differences here are ? lo' in the horizontal, and a? R3o' in the vertical direction, from what the needle stood at in the first morning's place. On moving ten yards SSE, the bearings were, Extensive Mount 1080 44P, Double Peak 143i 25'; the inclination was 52' 18', and the needle was vertical when the instrument faced S ,5 W. In this 4th set of observations, the horizontal direction of the needle is only a few minutes different from the first place, but the vertical direction is 1o 28'. From the top of the hill I now moved twenty yards to the north-eastward, when Extensive Mount bore 1 o0, Double Peak i4? ~42'; the inclination of the dipping needle was now 5co 35', and it stood vertical at S so W. Thus it appears that tOle polarity of the magnetic needle is most interrupted at the top of the hill, both according to the tlhodolite and dipping-needle. Whether this may arise fromn sonre particular mamgnetic substance lodged in the heart of the hill, or from the attractive powers of all the substances of the magnetic Needle. which compose Pier Head being centered in a similar point to what I have supposed to take place with all the ferruginous bodies lodged within a ship, I shall not attempt to decide. The greater differences in the horizontal direction of the needle observed by Captain CooK, might have arisen from his using a common azimuth compass, which was probably not further elevated from the ground than to be placed on a stone.
