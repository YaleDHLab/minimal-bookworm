[46] XIII. A Representation of the Parhelia seen in Kent, Dec. 19. 1741. communicated in a Letter from the Revd Mr. H. Miles, to John Eames, F. R. S. and an Account of the same, as seen by Mrs. Tennison at Canterbury. S I R, I Had Yesterday the Favour of yours of the 23d Instant, for which I return you my very hearty Thanks; particularly for the Honour you put on my brief Acount of the Height of the Liquors in my Thermometers, * in communicating it to the R O Y A L S O C I E T Y. Read Feb. 25. 1741-2. As no one wishes the Prosperity of that illustrious Body more truly than I do, I should think myself happy, were I able to do any thing to promote the Design of it, or to gratify any of its worthy Members. I have inclos'd a Draught of the Parhelia seen in Kent the 19th of December last, as I took it from a private Letter sent from thence to a Gentleman in this Town: The Writer of the Letter is not so particular in his Account of it as could be wish'd: His Words were to this Purpose: `` As to the Appearance `` of the Mock-Suns on the 19th of December, I have `` inclos'd a Scheme, such as I could draw, in which `` you may observe S is the Sun, Z the Zenith ~ ~ `` an inverted Rainbow of the most lively Colours; `` the Mock-Suns d d were sometimes almost too `` bright to look upon, and then they seem'd round, * Sec above, p. 20. `` but [47] `` but often were fring'd (as drawn) with the pris`` matic Colours; the Arch b b was but faint, and a `` whitish Light in the inner Part described at c. `` The Appearance ended about Noon, or rather a `` little before Twelve; how early the Whole was `` to be seen, I do not know.'' The two largest Semicircles, I find no Notice taken of.Z ~ ~ C b b d d S On Tuesday the 19th Instant, at 10 at Night, being the Time I generally register the Account of the Barometer and Thermometer, I found the Mercurial Thermometer abroad, at 20 Degrees above 0, or freezing Point: This I thought Extraordinary, and for that Reason I consulted my Register of last Year, and found 16 Mornings and 13 Evenings in May colder Air. And in April there were two Mornings and three Evenings only, a warmer Air. I am Your most obliged and most humble Servant, Wind was West all Day 19th, and H. Miles. began to rise when I made the Observation, at going to Bed. ` Dr. [48] ` Dr. Stukeley likewise gave in a Scheme of the same ` Appearance, as it was seen at Canterbury 10 h. 12 m. ` Dec. 19. 1741. in which the Light at c. was not ` taken Notice of. He copied it from a Drawing ` made by Mrs. Tennison, who sent it in a Letter to his ` Grace the Archbishop of Canterbury.' C. M.
