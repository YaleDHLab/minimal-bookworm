Philos=Transact=no=307 Tab: i. Fig: 1 Fig = IIIFig = II A B C D D (2304) IV. Of Hydatides inclosed with a Stony Crust in the Kidny of a Sheep. By Mr W. Cowper, F. R. S. IN the Sheeps Kidny, which was ordered at a late Meeting of the Society, to be set aside for me to examine, I found a large whitish body,inclining to yellow, and ting'd with red, as it lay under the Membrane of the Kidney, vid. Tab. I. Fig. 1.A. This was very hard,as is usual in Animal Petrifactions, 2 thirds of it lay hid within the substance of the Kidney: It was inclosed with a thick hard Membrane, thatcould not easily be separated from it, even with a Needle fixt in the end of a Stick. The Branches of the Emulgent Veins and Arteries, lay between it and the Pelvis of the Kidney; all which Vessels were somewhat prest by this petrified Body. As I was picking off its thick strong Membranous Inclosures, I found the Needle slip into a cavity at an Aperture Fig. II. By this I was inform'd (of what I must confess, before I had no suspicion of) that this hard and heavy Petrifyed Body was hollow, whereupon I thought of dividing it with a Saw, but finding a Membranous Interstice in it, Fig 2. B. I pull'd it asunder, as exprest Fig. III. and found its inside divided by many Petrifyed Cells C.of irregular Figures,and fill'd with Hydatides, some of which are represented at D. This uncommon appearance (at least to me) of a Petrifyed Crust inclosing Hydatides, I thought deserv'd the Figures annext. Tab. I. Fig. I. The external Surface of the Kidney of a Sheep. A.
