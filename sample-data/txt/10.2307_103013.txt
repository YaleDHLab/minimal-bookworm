(2127) III. Part of a Letter from Mr Ralph Thoresby, F. R. S. to Dr Hans Sloane, S. R. S. concerning some Norman Coyns found at York. I Had several weeks ago given you an account of some old Coyns lately found at York, but that I forbore, in hopes to make the account more perfect; which is as follows: Mr Samuel Buxton, late Sheriff of that Ancient City, designing to Build upon a Piece of Ground he had bought in High Ousegate, had Labourers to remove the ~ of a former House; which, with about 30 more, was burnt down April 3. 1694. In digging below the Foundations of the former House, at a considerable depth they discovered the more Ancient Foundations of an older Fabrick; very probably unknown to the Builders of the later House. These lower Foundations were very well supported at several Angles with good Oak Piles, some of which were so firm and sound, that they were good again for the same purpose; besides these Piles, there were several great Timber-tree, that lay ~, to make the stronger Foundation: Betwixt the head of two Piles in this lower Foundation, the Work men found a little decayed Oak-box, wherein had been hoarded about 200 or 250 pieces of the Norman Coyns; but age and the moisture of the place had so ~ them, that not much above 100 of them could be preserved: Through the Gentlemans kindness (who presented me with some of them) I had the ~ of about half that number, (the rest being given away before I heard of them) which proved the noblest frock that ever I saw, or indeed, heard of, of ~ the Conqueror's Coyns; not above 2 or 3 in the whole Cargo that I saw being of any other Prince: Those, tho later in B b b b b b b b b b b b b <inferred>a</inferred> time (2128) time, are more rare in value than many of the Roman and Saxon Coyns: these lower foundations also very well answer the account we have of the Timber-buildings in those Ages. The Coyns are very much alike; the King is represented full-faced, with a Crown and Labels, but neither Scepter, Cross or Star, as in other Moneys of his that I had before; most of them are inscibed W I L L E M V R E X, which some have mistaken for William the 2d; but by the declining of the strokes, it appears to be design'd for V, as I have one with the S after the V and before REX. By this accident there appears greater Variety, than ever was known before, of the Conqueror's Money, thro the kindness of Mr Buxton and others. I have of these sorts, W I L L E M V R E X. W I L L E M V S R E X. W I L L E M V R E X. I. (which is not to be reckoned a Numeral Letter, it being improper to pretend a distinction, when there was none of the Name before, but for part of the Letter A) W I L E M R E X A. (Angliae.)
