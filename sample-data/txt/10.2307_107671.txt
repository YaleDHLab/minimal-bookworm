L So J VIL. Elements off Captain HALL'S Comet. By J. BRINKLEY, D. D. F. R. S. and M. RX I. A. and Andrew's Professor of Astronomy in the University of Dublin. It a Letter addressed to W. H. WOLLASTON, M. D. V. P. R. S. Read, January 1o, 1822. Observatory, Trinity College, Dublin, MY DEAR SIR, October I5, l82I. I SEND YOU the elements of the comet observed at Valpa. raiso, the observations of which you were so kind as to send to me. We are indebted to the science of Captain HALL, for adding -this comet to our catalogue. The observations appear to have been as exact as could have been made even in an established observatory, on a comet only visible so near the horizon, and so far from the meridian, and of which the light was probably faint both from its actual distance from us, and its apparent proximity to the sun. The comet on the 8th of April was distant nearly 1,41 from the earth, the sun's distance from the earth being unity, and on the 3d of May, when last seen, about 2,64. This comet is interesting to astronomers on account of its small perihelion distance. In the Catalogue of M. DELAMBRE, out of ii6 comets, the orbits of which have been computed, there are only three that pass nearer the sun. It is interesting also, from the probability that it is the same comet that was observed in i593, which agrees with this in Dr. BRINKLEY'S elements, &c. 51 its small perihelion distance and great inclination. The incliination was computed by LACAILLE to be 880 nearly. The inclination of this is 1060 4,V, The perihelion distance of that = ,o89, of this ,093. This comet would probably have been a very remarkable one by its appearance, had the earth been in a favourable situation. It may, at first, cause some surprize, that it escaped the watchful observers of Europe when on the north side of the ecliptic, in February and March last, before it passed its peri-. helion; but on examination it will be found, that in March it was only a few degrees from the sun, and must have been rendered invisible by the superior lustre thereof. It passed from the north to the south side of the plane of the earth's orbit, March z1st, 13h 3om, a few hours after it had passed its perihelion; and its elongation from the sun then was only about 4. The observations having been made so long after its passage through perihelion, the smallness of its perihelion distance, and some other circumstances, have involved the computation in difficulties not often met with. This induces me to request you will lay before the Royal Society, the method by which I proceeded. The unusual circumstances relative to this comet, will also appear by referring to a passage in the Preface of M. BURCKHARDT's new table of the Parabolic Movements, &c. in the Coni. des Temps, i818. It relates to the interval of his table from iooo to 10,000 days, of which hle says," comme il est probable que, cette partie ne servirajamais dans la pray tique, &c." Now, in the observations after the i8th of April, -Dr. BRINKLEY's elements of the anomalies of this comet exceeded that of iooo days in the tabular comet. Besides the elements (B) deduced by the method of which the explanation is given, I had previously deduced another set (A) by a process less certain in its operations. The latter set (A) however, may be thought not much inferior to the other set (B). I remain, my dear Sir, your's most truly, Dr. Wo1as8on, ec. 4c. 8Sc. J. BRINKLEY. Elements (B.) Elements (A.)

The method used for the first approximation was that of M. LAPLACE.* The observations chosen were those of April 8, ii, and 14. It considerably diminishes the length of the calculation to use only three observations, where it can be done. In the present instance it is not likely, had a greater number of observations been used, that the superior accuracy derived would have compensated for the additional trouble. The result from the three observations is as exact as would be necessary on common occasions. Here, on account of the small perihelion distance and small motion of the comet in heliocentric longitude between the first and last observations, the method of M. LAPLACE,f C' Determination exacte des elemens de l'orbite &c. &c." is inapplicable; the errors of . the motion in heliocentric longitude being greater than the motion itself. The extension however of that method, as indicated by M. DELAMBRE, t might succeed in this instance, but the formidable calculations necessary are sufficient to deter one from the attempt. The method which I gave in Vol. XIII. p. 189, of the Transactions of the Royal Irish Academy, also, in this case, requires to be extended. It will be necessary to introduce the squares of the variation of the perihelion distance, and of the correction of the time from perihelion. The manner in which my method is extended to this case will be easily understood from the following detail; and also the change I have made in deriving on common* Mec. Celes.

Therefore the coefficients of the differentials dp and dt in dH will be quite incorrect, if the differential of H be computed in the common way. It is the smallness of f-j3' and i3'-f3" in this case that renders M. LAPLACE'S method of computing V, V' inconvenient, in consequence of its being necessary to use the tangent of an angle nearly =9go'. But the variations of V and V' may be obtained with suffix. cient accuracy in the following manner.

Hence, substituting the values of 2, (3', 3"t, Ire, XI-* E &c. &C. we obtain dV =-344*+,3446xI-4390X+N (268o-,4672x+,2188x') dV'--7o3 + ,2954X"-4390x+N(4845-,4672x+ ,io6x"7) where log N = 5.63801 and log N'-=5.47328 and finally, equations (8) and (9) give N (2680-2534dt+63l 5odpY-,364dt-15o649dp=2428 (12) N'(4845-3166dt+83572dp)2-452dt-2276i9dp=321 ( 2 3i) From these equations the values of dp and dt may be derived. The indirect solution seems to be the shortest, as we know the value of dp within narrow limits. The first error of p as deduced fromn the approximation of LAPLACE, rarely indeed will amount to + ,01. 1. Let us suppose dp=-,05. Then equation (io) gives dt=+4 294 and-,94. The positive value is too great to be admitted, taking t= 1,194, the result from equation (13) is 0 -468. * This number 344!=60 i6'444.".,6O InS should be strictly 3671-6' W44" V6? 37 "; but the accidental omission of 37" is not of the smallest conseqtence in the result.

Therefore we may now make po86s + ,oo= i9l, and t 19,9 18 1,838 8,0738. With these values we obtain, having corrected the sun's places and comet's observed places for aberration, and made the computations-to seven places of figures, I. 1~~ 10 /i April I36 53 5JI29 47 32=6 50 5i I667JM 21 4 50 48=,' 2459 14=3' 43 38 4=%' May 23 1+ 48 45=gz3" ' =l39 56 29=,z V-70 5' 6"V'=/ I1' 33I". On account of the great changes that have taken place in some of these quantities, particularly in the longitudes it will be better to re-compute dy, dr, d1, &c. &c.

For this purpose it is very convenient and sufficiently exact* to compute, in, the spherical triangle formed by the sides * We are enabled to use this short process for finding the inclination, in consequence of being able to compute so readily the new values of dV, and dV as well as of d,, df3, &c. &c. by substituting in the values above given, the last values of dp, do. This may be considered as another advantage of this method of correcting the approximate elements of a comet's orbit.

These angles are ixS 88' g", which gives the inclination 730 19' 50" i,52 i 56, which gives the inclination 73 II 47 Now, if the orbit were an exact parabola, and the observations perfectly accurate, the above quantities ought, in consequence of the exactness that has been used in the computation, to agree to a second. Hence is seen the unavoidable errors arising fromn these two causes jointly. It is probable, that the deviation from a parabola has no sensible effect in the present case. With the mean value 152 45' 3" we get the place of the node 48 4 41', and the place of perihelion-7 2906' 471' There evidently appears an irregularity in the three last right ascensions observed April 29, May I and 3. It is possible, that this happened in consequence of the difficulty of observing the comet from its faintness : if so, each of the observations may partake of that irregularity, and the inaccuracy of the observation of May 3, may have affected the elements. This might have been avoided, by combining a greater number of observations in correcting the approximate elements, but the advantage would not, probably, have repaid the additional labour. The remark on these latter observations, must not be understood to imply, in the smallest degree, a defect in observing; on the contrary, the general exactness of the observations appears highly creditable to the observers, and requires no 62 Dr. BRINKLEYs -elemens f aliowance for the un avoidable difficulties-under which they must have observed. Note.-The computations relative to the comet observed by Captain HALL, were finished in the middle of October last, and the results immediately sent to London for the purpose of being laid before the Royal Society. The second part of the Transactions for 1821, did not reach me till after the communication had been read at the Royal Society. In that second part, I was much surprised to find the elements of the same comet computed by Mr. RUMKER, from the observations made by Dr. OLBERS, before the passage through perihelion. Subsequently, the", Conn. des Tems," for i824 reached me, which contains Observations made at Paris and Elements by M. NICOLLET; also a notice of the comet having been observed in several places of Europe. It certainly is highly creditable to those observers who discovered, under very difficult circumstances, the comet in its approach to the sun. By the addition of Captain HALL'S observations after the passage through perihelion, we are enabled to obtain very exact elements. The errors of my Elements, when applied to observations before perihelion, and the errors of Mr. RuMKER'S and of M. NICOLLET's Elements, when applied to Captain HALL'S observations after perihelion are considerable: Therefore, I have farther corrected my Elements, by using Dr. OLBERS' observations of January So, with those of Captain HALL of April 8, and May 3.
