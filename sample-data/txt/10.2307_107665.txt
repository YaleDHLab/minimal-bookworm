PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS. I. The Bakerian Lecture, An Account of Experiments to de*termine the amount of the Dip of the Magnetic Needle in London, in August 1821 ; with Remarks on the Instruments which are usually employed in such determinations. By Captain EDWARD SABINE of the Royal Regiment of Artillery, F. R. S. Read November 2A, 1821. IHE increased attention which has been given of late years by several philosophers to the subject of magnetism, and the consequent advance which has been made in this branch of natural knowledge, render it desirable, that a greater degree of accuracy should be obtained in all respects, in observing its various terrestrial phenomnena, than hitherto. This remark applies especially toobservations on the dip of the needle ; the instruments in general use for this purpose have received little or no improvement during the last fifty years, and produce results which can only be considered as approximate, even when the observer has made himself well acquainted with the various sources of inaccuracy in the instru-. ment, and has adopted precautions to guard against, or remedy them. MDCCCXXII. B 2 Captain SABINE'S experiments to determine the Many of these, indeed, are not difficult of detection, and admit of compensation by certain known methods of observing; such are those which are caused by incorrect graduation, by the eccentricity of the needle with respect to the divided circle, by the agate planes which support the axis of the needle not being truly horizontal,-or -by their --n-on--coincidence with the right line joining the zeros of the circle. The errors to which even the most careful determinations are subject, are to be referred chiefly to faults in the construction of the needle itself; ist, to imperfection in the axis, whereby the needle, on being made to oscillate, will not return with certainty in repeated trials to the same division of the limb; and, 2ndly, to the difficulty which even the most skilful artists experience, in the endeavour to make the axis of motion pass through the centre of gravity; a condition which is essential to accuracy in the usual mode of observation, but of which it may be safely said, that its accomplishment admits of no very certain proof, and that it is rarely or never succeeded in. It is obvious that a needle, of which the balance is not thus correctly adjusted, will not assume, on being suspended freely in the plane of the meridian, the direction which magnetism alone would have imparted to it, and that it will, in consequence, err sensibly from the true dip ; the remedy which has been recommended for this inconvenience, and which has become the usual practice, is to reverse the poles of the needle, and to take the arithmetical mean of the arcs indicated in four positions, as the true magnetic dip. The sanction of this method by persons who are regarded as authorities, is a sufficient indication, that observations of the dip amount of the dip of the magnetic needle, in London, &c. s were considered by them merely as approximations; since it could not have--been otherwise overlooked, that the arithmetical mean is in no case the result which is strictly deduciblei from the arcs, and that, in many instances, it must differ considerably from the more correct deduction; whilst the adoption of this method in general practice, has charged the results with an error, which might have been avoided; the amount of which can only now be known, when the details of the observation have been given, and furnish the means of re-computation. The perfect balancing of the needle is sometimes attempted by a cross of wires affixed to the axis, as described in the Philosophical Transactions for 1772, Article 3; but this contrivance is more ingenious than useful in practice, and introduces a liability to errors, of far more importance than the inconveniencies which it was designed to obviate. The adjustment of the balance, after the needle is magnetised, is in itself a troublesome, tedious, and uncertain operation, and is far too subject to derangement to be confided in, when the instrument has been removed from station to station; moreover, the inaccuracies occasioned by friction, are augmented by the additional weight of the mechanism on the one arm of the axis, and of a counterweight on the other. The errors of an-imperfect balance are reducible by calculation, but those of friction are not so; whether they may arise -from the axis not being truly cylindrical, or from the inequalities of its surface producing a resistance on the planes, which the moving force of the needle is not fully adequate to overcome. It may be, therefore, justly remarked, that the true and unimpeded motion of the axis, and the consequent 4 Captain SABINE'S experiments to determine the return of a needle in successive trials to the same division of the limb, is one of the principal qualifications of a good dipping needle. Having been convinced by the trial of several needles, that the disagreement in their results was chiefly to be attributed to the various causes of inaccuracy in the motion of the axis, I requested Mr. DOLLOND to make a needle on a construction suggested, from similar experience, by Professor J. TOBIAS MEYER, in his treatise " de usu accuratiori acuis inclinatoriae Magneticae," published in the Transactions of the Royal Society of Sciences at Gottingen for 1814. The experiments which are now submitted to the Royal Society were made with this needle, which, for simplicity of construction, convenience in use, and consistency of results, appears to deserve a preference over those which have been hitherto employed. As the needle which Mr. DOLLOND made, differed in some few particulars from the construction recommended by Professor MEYER, it may be proper to prefix a short description of it, as well as of the mode of observation. The needle is a parallelopipedon of eleven inches and a half in length, four tenths in breadth, and one twentieth in thickness; the ends are rounded; and a line marked on the face of the needle passing through the centre to the extremities, answers the purpose of an index. The cylindrical axis on which the needle revolves, is of bell metal, terminated, where it rests on the agate planes, by cylinders of less diameter; the finer these terminations are made, so long as they do not bend with theweight of the needle, the more accurate will be the oscillations; small amount of the dii of the magnetic needle, in London, &c5 grooves in the thicker part of the axis receive the Y's, which raise and lower the needle on its supports, and ensure that the same -parts of the axis rest in each observation on the planes. A small brass sphere traverses on a steel screw, inserted in the lower edge of the needle, as nearly as possible in the perpendicular to the index line passing through the axis of motion; by this mechanism, the centre of gravity of the needle, with the screw and sphere, may be made to fall more or less below the axis of motion, according as the sphere is screwed nearer or more distant from the needle, and according as spheres of greater or less diameter are employed. The object proposed in thus separating the centres of motion and gravity, is to give to the needle a force arising from its own -weight to assist that of magnetism in overcoming the inequalities of the axis, and -thus to cause the needle to return, after oscillation, with more certainty to the same point of the divided limb, than it would do were the centres strictly coincident. The centres of motion and of gravity not coinciding, the position which the needle assumes, when placed in the magnetic meridian is not that of the dip: but the dip is deducible by an easy calculation, from observations made with such a needle, according to the following directions. If the needle has been carefully made, and the screw inserted truly as described, the centres of motion and of gravity will be disposed as in the lever of a balance, when a right line joining them will be a perpendicular to the horizontal passing through the extremities (or to the index line); this 6 Captain SABlNE'S experiments to determine the condition 'is not indeed -a necessary one, but it is desirable to be accomplished because it shortens the observations, as well as the calculation, from whence the dip is deduced; its'fulfilment may be ascertained with great precision by placing the needle on the agate planes before magnetism is imparted to it, and observing whether it returns to a horizontal direction, after oscillation in each position of the axis ; if it does not, it may be made to do so at this time with no great trouble. With a needle in which this adjustment can be relied on, two observations made in the magnetic meridian are sufficient for the determination of the dip, the two faces of the needle being successively towards the observer, reversing the position of the axis on its supports in such manner that the edge of the needle which is uppermost in the one observation becomes lowermost in the other; the angles which the needle makes with the verticals in these two positions being read, the mean of the tangents of those -angles is the co-tangent of the dip. But when needles are used in which this adjustment has not been made, or where its accuracy cannot be relied on, four observations are required; two being those which are already directed; the two others are similar to them, but with the poles of the needle reversed; calling then the first arcs F and p and those with the poles reversed G and g, and taking tang F + tanf = A tang F tanfB tang G +tang = C tang G-tang-D A.D B.C B + D+B+ D twice the co-tangent of the dip. amount of the dip of the magnetic needle, in London, &ac. 7 The demonstration of this formula is given in the, treatise which has been referred to; the investigation is simple. In reversing the poles, it is not necessary that the magnetic force imparted to the needle should be the same in amount as it possessed previously to the operation. By adopting the precaution of placing the needle in a groove to prevent its lateral motion, and by confining the sides of the magnet by parallel strips of wood, so that in. moving along the needle they may preserve its direction, the poles may always be ensured to coincide with the extremities of the longitudinal axis. It is desirable to be furnished with several spheres of different diameters, to possess the means of proportioning the force, arising from the eccentricity, to the force of magnetism, as the latter is doubled between the equator and the poles; it may be expedient that the force of magnetism should always predominate,bthough no such inference appears to result from the present experiments, in which eight spheres were used, numbered according to size, No. 1 being the largest. If the distance between the centres of motion and of gravity be considerable, the arcs in the alternate observations will be on different sides of the vertical, especially where the dip is great; in such cases the arcs to the south of the vertical are read negatively. The instrument in which the needle was tried is already described in the Philosophical Transactions for i8 i9, page 132, and several improvements which have been since added, in the Appendix to Captain PARRY'S Voyage of Discovery, pages cvii. cxxxix., &c.; the perfect horizontality of the 8 Captain SABINE'Sexperiments to determine--the agate planes, and the -adjustments of the zeros of the circle were verified in every change of position of the instrument by the double cone apparatus described in page cxl., which proves very convenient in use, and is highly conducive to accuracy; the circle is divided into spaces of twenty minutes, but by means of a moveable lens, the arcs to which the needle settles can be read off, with tolerable correctness, to minutes; the arcs, in each of the four positions forming the elements from whence the dip is deduced, are the arithmeticalmean of (usually) six observations, half of which are with the face of the circle towards the east, and half with the face towards the west; the needle being lifted by the Y's and lowered gently on its supports between each observation; the arcs indicated by both ends of the needle are also read, to correct the errors arising from inequality in the divisions, or from the axis of the needle not passing correctly through the centre of the circle. The experiments were made in the nursery garden in the Regent's Park, by permission of Mr. JENKINS, the proprietor. The situation is in all respects an eligible one, being far removed from the neighbourhood of iron. The two first experiments are given in detail, that the method of observation may be more fully exemplified. amount of the di' of the magnetic needle, in London, &c. 9 Experiment i.

The screw on which the spheres traversed was made, in the first instance, half an inch in lenpgth but was shortened one half after the third experiment; being found still longer than necessary, it was again shortened after the eighth experiment, until its length just equalled the diameter of the largest sphere. Being desirous to confirm the correctness of the result obtained with MEYER's needle, Imade the following expe-. riments for the purpose of -deducing at least an approxi'mation of the dip by a method suggested, I believe, originally by LAPLACE, of observing the times in which a certain number of oscillations are made by a dipping needle, in the magnetic meridian, and in the plane perpendicular to it, 12 Capta i SABINE'S experiments to determine the The force acting on the needle in the latter case is reduced, according to the principles of the resolution of forces, in the ratio of the radius to the sine of the dip ; whence calling M the time in which a certain number of vibrations are made in the meridian, P the corresponding time in the perpendicular plane, and D the dip, z =sine D. In all the subsequent experiments, the needles were retained and released at an angle of 400 with the meridian, by an apparatus for that purpose fitted to the instrument, and were suffered to oscillate until the arc of vibration was reduced to So0 before the account was taken up, and the observation commenced.

As this method, which is highly deserving of adoption in the lower magnetic latitudes, must become far less certain in parallels so high as 700, when a very small alteration in either of the observed times will produce a wide difference iin the conclusion: unless, therefore the oscillation of a needle in suitable arcs can be continued through a number of seconds, much exceeding those of the preceding experiments, the result may be liable, without great care and frequent repetition, to considerable error. I am not aware that a method of deducing the dip on a similar principle, but possessing the same advantages in the high latitudes as the former does between the magnetic equator and 45 (nearly), has been heretofore suggested: it is by observing the times in which a certain number of oscillations are inade by the same needle in the following positions; first, when used as a dipping needle, vibrating in the plane of the meridian; and, secondly, when suspended horizontally by a silk thread attached to either end of the axis, the needle being limited thereby to a horizontal motion. The square of the times of horizontal vibration being ins creased, as the radius to the cosine of the dip, it is obvious, that, as in the former method, the effect of errors of observation on the result increases with the angle of the dip, amount of the d~ P of the magnetic needle, in London, &cA i according as the differences of the sines progressively diminish ; so in this method, on the contrary, the influence of such errors will be lessened in the same ratio: thus in dipls of 650 and upwards, the determination may be made with very consiL' derable accuracy, with instruments generally of good con-e struction and with needles of which the terminations of the axis are very slender. The horizontal vibrations should be made under a cover of glass, or of wood with glass windows; the silk suspension should be several inches in length, and perfectly free from twist. The following experiment was made with the needle numbered 3 in the preceding; the silk line was tS inches in length, and was fastened in a groove near the end of the axis; the oscillations were made in arcs under 250.

In referring to the observations which are recorded to hav been made for the purpose of determining the dip in London in former years, those of Mr. NAIRNr,,gin X772, of Mr. CAVENDISH, In 1 776, and of Mr. GILPTW, in 1805, appear to have received, and to be deserving of, principal consideration; the errors by which these severaldeterminations may have been affected, in conisequence of the imperfections of the irnstruments, may be believed to have been cotifinedd within limits of no great etert, by the method of the observers and by the precautions which they adopted; -as, however th, observations were made -in houses in close built parts of the metropolis, they were all subject to the influence of local attraction, fromwhence may have originated errors of-greater consequence possibly than Ithose of the instruments; nor can the application of a correction found by observing the difference of the dip, on the outside of the house, be considered an effectual remedy, inasmuch as sthe needle may still have been attracted by iron in the adjoining houses, or in the neighbourhood. It needs only to try needles in different situations in a city, to be convinced how little .dependance should be placed in the accuracy of such results; it may, no doubt, be principally owing to this cause, rather than to instrumental error, that the dip at the Apartments of the Royal Society is stated in the Philosophical Transactions for the present year (182 1), to be 7t0 6k or 710 42'. As the observations of Mr. NAIRNE, in 1772, and of Mr. C AVENDISH, in 1776, do not difier very widely from each amount of the dip of the magnetik needle, in Londohn, &c. 19 other, either in the date; or in the amount of the dip., their mean, 72? 25 , inm 774, may be considered as the best approxi mation which can now be made to a knowledge of the amount of the dip in London at an early period. By comparing this amount with the dip in the present year as above determined, we obtain 3',o2 as a mean annual rate of diminution between 1-774 and 1821; which is less by two. fifths than the mean annual diminution at Paris between the years 1798 and i814, as deduced froin the observations of Messrs. HUMBOLDT, GAY LUSSAc, and ARAGO; whence it might be inferred, if sufficient dependance could be placed on the accuracy of the observations, that the annual variation of the dip in this part of the world, is greater now than it was 8o or 40 years since. It is, however, worthy of notice, as being at least a curious coincidence, that if we take Mr. VHiSTON's determination of the dip in 1720, 75 1 (of Which Mr. CAVENDISH remarked in the Philosophical Transactions for 1776, Art. 21,) that bhe believed it to have been pretty accurate, as Mr. WHISTON observed in many parts of the kingdom, and his obser.. vations agreed well together," we obtain between the years 1720 and 1774, an annual diminution of 5 which differs only three hundredths of a minute from the rate which has been now found for the succeeding 47 years. It may not be useless, briefly to examine how far the knowledge of the amount of change, by direct observation, is capable of receiving confirmation by the effect which a diai-. nution of dip must produce on the vibrations of a needle suspended horizontally. If the intensity of the magnetic force be considered to vary 20 Captain SABINJ&'s experiments to determine the in -the ratio suggested by Dr. YOUNG, inversely as the square root of four diminished by three times the square of the sine of the dip, which ratio has been remarkably confirmed in dips from 70 to go degrees, by the experiments made during the late Arctic voyage; the force acting on the horizontal needle, being reduced as the radius to the cosine, becomes inversely as, VTs + 3; s being the sine of the dip; whence, in London, the duration of any number of horizontal vibrations would be increased by about 3-0!0 part, on a reduction of one minute in the dip. The needle No. . of the preceding experiments, Susa pended in the manner therein described, and released at an arc of 4Q0 from the meridian, will continue to vibrate more than forty minutes, making upwards of 400 vibrations, before the arcs become so small as to render the completion of each vibration indistinct. If the times of commencement and conclusion are observed in the method exemplified in the experiment with this needle, page 17; the duration of any number of vibrations may be readily and accurately determined to a part of a second ; if, therefore, 400 be taken as the experimental number, and the duration be supposed 42 minutes, or 2520 seconds, the reduction of 3 minutes of dip, which is presumed to take place annually, would cause an increase of two seconds and two-tenths in the time of vibration ; which difference may, perhaps, be considered sufficient to encourage the experiment, especially if a mean be taken of many observations in each year; in which case it may be advisable to compare together observations made at the same season in successive years; and perhaps, also, at the samehour of the day; although the experiments of Messrs. HUMBOLDT and amount of the di of the magnetic needle, in London, &c. 21 GAY LuSSAC have shown, that if any hourly variation of tiw force does obtain, it is not sufficient to produce a perceptible effect in a time of vibration amounting to i 234 seconds, repeated at different hours of the day and night. In conclusion, there appears reason to presume from the preceding experiments, that the dip itself may be determined by MEYER's needle within a much 7smaller limit of uncertainty, than has hitherto been the case by needles of the usual construction; as' the results are subject only to those errors, which are reducible by repetition; for in the ten exit periments which have been submitted to the Society, the, greatest difference of any one from the mean does not exceed three minutes; the direct observation may, therefore, be considered as capable of sufficient precision, to justify infe, rences -from repetition, at intervals of short duration both of the amount, and also of the uniformity, of the changes to which the dip is subject.
