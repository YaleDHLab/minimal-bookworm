An Account of a remarkable Marine Production: In a Letter to the Reverend Thomas Birch, D. D. Secretary to the Royal Society, from Alexander Russell, M. D. Physician to St. Thomas's Hospital, and F. R. S. S I R, MY ingenious friend Dr. James Nasmyth, having been so kind as to send me a marine production, which appears to be singular, I thought some account of it would not be unacceptable to the Royal Society. I have therefore troubled you with the inclosed papers, containing an extract of Dr. Nasmyth's letter; a description of the body, as it appeared upon the joint examination of Dr. Solander, Messieurs Peter Collinson, John Ellis, and Read June 24, 1762. Philos. Trans. Vol. LIII. TAB. XVII. p. 555. I.Mynde sc. [555] and <inferred>myself</inferred>, several months after I received it; together ith two drawings by Mr. Edwards; [Vide Tab. VII.] one of which represents it entire, nearly of <inferred>itsnatural</inferred> size and colour; the other after it was opene. I am, S I R, Your most obedient humble servant, W brook, June 0, 1762. Alexander Russell. Extract from Dr. Nasmyth's Letter. AT my return from North America, in November 1759, I sent you two or three articles picked up in hat country. One of these, from its singular apperance, and from its being a perfect stranger to <inferred>every</inferred> body (both French and English) that saw it, I <inferred>must</inferred> now recommend to your attention. The desire of keeping it entire, and as it was found, prvented any other investigation, than that of viewing it particularly, when I first got it, and at times afterwards, to be assured of its safety, as well as to <inferred>observe</inferred> the changes it might undergo, while it con<inferred>tinued</inferred> in spirits. From you, Sir, at your leisure, I <inferred>shall</inferred> be extremely glad to receive farther information. It the mean time, I shall give you the circumstances atending its acquisition. In [556] In the month of June 1759, the squadron ~ against Quebec, arrived in the river St. Larence, when, being in the latitude 49. 50. north, anabout ten leagues to the eastward of Anticosti, (an ~ in the mouth of the river) we sounded, and truck ground in 42 fathoms; the soundings white sad and black specks. Having, at the same time, thrownoverboard a fishing-line, the hook was found <inferred>strongly</inferred> attached at the bottom; and, after some ~, brought up a piece of rock into the surface of which was inserted a strong tendinous substance, of alight brown colour, in length about seven inches; ~ was round, and nearly of the thickness of a common goose-quill; the other end formed a sack, or ~, of the size and shape of a pigeon's egg. The whole of this substance was elastic; and, pon pressing the bag, I plainly discovered a contained ubstance, and imagined, that it was attended with notion. These, Sir, are all the particulars I have go to offer upon this unknown subject: whether <inferred>animal</inferred>, zoophite, or submarine plant, I leave to your ~mination. [Thus far Dr. Nasmyth.] Upon our examination, it appeared to us to cone nearest to what has been, by naturalists, called <inferred>pria-</inferred> pus; give us leave, therefore, to name it <inferred>priapus</inferred> pendunculo filiformi corpore ovato. The body <inferred>was</inferred> oval, and in size between a pigeon and pullet's ~, smooth, membranous, and of a silver ash colour. What appeared to be the mouth, was situated a litte below the apex, and was quadrivalvular, in the form of [557] of a (~) cross. The anus was on the same side, a little above the base, or insertion of the stalk, and also quadrivalvular. Towards the aperture of the mouth and anus, the body felt more callous. From this body issued a peduncle, or stalk, of ten inches in length, the extreme end of which was fixed to a piece of rock. This stalk was of a light brown colour, about the thickness of a large hen's quill, round, hollow, rough, and of a membranous, leather-like substance. When the body was opened, the internal coat appeared to be composed of reticular fibres. The interior orifice of the mouth was surrounded by a radiated substance, about the size of a silver penny, thicker and more callous than the coats of any other part. The internal aperture of the anus was composed of fibres interwoven with one another. From the apex to the base, on each side, descended obliquely, and winding, a smooth solid body~ in width about one fifth part of an inch, part of which separated in the examining; so that it is but imperfectly represented in the drawing. We cannot give a clearer idea of this body, than by saying, that it had greatly the appearance (excepting in size) of one of the small intestines, and was attached to the interior surface of the main body, much in the way as they are to the~ mesentery.
