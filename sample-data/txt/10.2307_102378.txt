By Mr. Ab. De Moivre. 'T I S about two Years since, that considering Mr. Newton's Theorem for Raising a Binomial to any given Power, or Extracting any Root of the same; I enquired, whether what he had done for a Binomial, could not be done for an infinite Multinomial. I soon found the thing was possible, and effected it, as you may see in the following Paper; I design in a little time to shew the Uses it may be applied to: In the mean while, those that are already vers'd in the Doctrine of Infinite Series, and have seen what Applications Mr. Newton has made of his Theorem, may of themselves derive several Uses from this. I suppose that the Infinite Number Multinomial is az+bzz+cz3+dz4+ez5 &c. m is the Index of the Power, to which this Multinomial ought to be Rais'd, or is you will, 'tis the Index of the Root which is to be Extracted: I say that this Power or Root of the Multinomial, is such a Series as I have exprest. For the Understanding of it, it is only necessary to consider all the Terms by which the same Power of z is Multiplied; in order thereto I distinguish two things in each of these Terms; 1~ The Product of certain Powers (620) Powers of the quantities, a, b, c, d, &c. 2~ the Unciae (as Oughtred calls 'em) prefixt to these Products. To find all the Products belonging to the same Power of z, to that Product, for instance, whose Index is m+r (where r may denote any integer Number) I divide these Products into several Classes; those which immediately after some certain Power of a (by which all these Products begin) have b, I call Products of the 1rst Classis; For Example am-4b3e is a Product of the 1rst Classis, because b immediately follows am-4; those which immediately after some Power of a have c, I call Products of the 2d Classis, so am-3ccd is a Product of the 2d Classis; Those which immediately after some Power of a have d, I call Products of the 3d Classis, and so of the rest. This being done, I Multiply all the Products belonging to zm+r-1 (which precedes immediately zm+r) by b and Divide 'em all by a; 2~ I Multiply by c and Divide by a, all the Products belonging to zm+r-2, Except those of the 1rst Classis; 3~ I Multiply by d and Divide by a all the Products belonging to zm+r-3, Except those of the 1rst and 2d Classis, 4~ I Multiply by e and Divide by a all the Terms belonging to zm+r-4, Except those of the 1rst, 2d and 3d Classis, and so on, till I meet twice with the same term. Lastly, I add to all these Terms the Product of am-1 into the Letter whose Exponent is r+1. Here I must take notice that by the Exponent of a Letter, I mean the number which expresses what Place the Letter has in the Alphabet, so 3 is the Exponent of the Letter c because the Letter c is the 3d in the Alphabet. It is evident that by this Rule, you may easily find all the Products belonging to the several Powers of z, if you have but the Product belonging to zm, viz. am. To (621) To find the Unciae which ought to be prefixt to every Product, I consider the Sum of Units contained in the Indices of the Letters which compose it (the Index of a excepted) I write as many Terms of the Series m~m-1~m-2~m-3,&c. as there are Units in the Sum of these Indices, this Series is to be the Numerator of a Fraction, whose Denominator is the Product of the several Series 1 ~ 2 ~ 3 ~ 4 ~ 5, &c. 1 ~ 2 ~ 3 ~ 4 ~ 5, &c. 1 ~ 2 ~ 3 ~ 4 ~ 5 ~ 6, &c. the 1rst of which contains as many Terms as there are Units in the Index of b, the 2d~ as many as there are Units in the Index of c, the 3d as many as there are Units in the Index of d, the 4th as many as there are Units in the Index of e, &c. Demonstration. To raise the Series az+bzz+cz3 + dz4, &c. to any Power whatsoever, write so many Series equal to it as these are Units in the Index of the Power demanded. Now it is evident that when these Series are so Multiplied, there are several Products in which there is the same Power of z, thus if the Series az+bzz+cz3 +dz4 &c. is rais'd to its Cube, you have the Products b3z6, abcz6, aadz6, in which you find the same Power z 6 Therefore let us consider what is the Condition that can make some Products to contain the same Power of z, the first thing that will appear in relation to it, is that in any Product whatsoever, the Index of z is the Sum of the particular Indices of z in the Multiplying Terms (this follows from the the nature of Indices) thus b3z6 is the Product of bz2, bz2, b z2, and the Sum of the Indices in the Multiplying Terms, is 2+2+2= 6; abcz6 in the Product of az, bzz, cz3, and the Sumof them Indices of z in the Multiplying Terms is 1+2+3=6 aadz6 is the Product of az, az, dz4, and the Sum of the Z z z z Indices (622) Indices of z in the Multiplying Terms is 1+1+4=6; the next thing that appears is, that the Index of z in the Multiplying Terms is the same with the Exponent of the Letter to which z is joyn'd, from which two Considerations it follows that, To have all the Products belonging to a certain Power of z, you must find all the Products where the Sum of the Exponents of the Letters which compose 'em shall always be the same with the Index of that Power. Now this is the method I use to find easily all the Products belonging to the same Power of z, Let m+r be the Index of that Power, I consider that the Sum of the Exponents of the Letters which compose these Products must exceed by 1 those which belong to mm+r-1, now because the excess of the Exponent of the Letter b above the Exponent of the Letter a, is 1, it follows that if each of the Products belonging to zm+r-1 is Multipli'd by b, and Diuided by a, you will have Products the Sum of whose Exponents will be m+r; Likewise the Sum of the Exponents of the Letters which compose the Products belonging to zm+r exceeds by 2 the Sum of the Exponents of the Letters which compose the Products belonging to zm+r-2; Now because the Exponent of the Letter a is less by 2 than the Exponent of the letter c, it follows, that if each Product belonging to zm+r-2 is Multipli'd by c and Divided by a, you will have other Products the Sum of whose Exponents is still m+r; Now if all the Products belonging to zm+r-2 were Multiplied by c and Divided by a, you would have some Products that would be the same as some of those found before, therefore you must except out of 'em those that I have call'd Products of the 1rst Classis; what I have said shows why all the Products belonging to zm+r-3, except those of the 1rst and 2d Classis must be Multipli'd by d and Divided by a: Lastly, you see the Reason why to all these Products is added (623) added the Product of am 1 by the Letter whose Exponent is r+1; 'Tis because the Sum of the Exponents is still m+r. As for what relates to the Unciae; observe that when you Multiply az+bzz+cz3+dz4, &c. by az+bzz+cz3 dz4, &c, each Letter a, b, c, d, &c. of the 2d Series is Multipli'd by each of the Letters a, b, c, d, &c. of the 1rst Series; Thus the Letter a of the 2d Series is Multipli'd by the letter b of the 1rst, and the letter b of he 2d Series is Multipli'd by the Letter a of the 1rst; therefore you have the 2 Planes, ab, ab or 2ab; for the same reason you have 2ac, 2ad, &c. Therefore you must prefix to each Plane of those that compose the Square of the Infinite Series az+bzz+cz3, &c. the Number which expresses how many ways the Letters of each Plane may be changed; Likewise if you Multiply the Product of the two preceeding Series by az+bzz+cz3, &c. each Letter a, b, c, d, of the 3d Series is Multiplied by each of the Planes form'd by the Product of the 1rst and 2d Series; Thus the Letter a is Multiplied by the Planes bc and cb; the Letter b is Multiplied by ac and ca; the Letter c is Multiplied by ab and ba; theresore you have the 6 Solids, abc, acb, bac, bca, cab, cba, or 6abc; Therefore you must prefix to each Solid whereof the Cube of the Infinite Series is compos'd, the Number which expresses how many ways the Letters of each Solid may be Changed. And generally, You must prefix to any Product whereof any Power of the Infinite Series az+bzz+cz3, &c. is compos'd the Number which expresses how many ways the Letter of each Product may be changed. Now to find how many ways the Letters of any Product, for instances am-n bh cp dr may be changed; this is the Rule which is commonly given: write as many terms of the Series 1 ~ 2 ~ 3 ~ 4 ~ 5, &c. as there are Units in the Sum of the Indices,viz. m-n+h+p+r, let this Series Z z z z 2 be (624) be the Numerator of a Fraction whose Denominator shall be the Product of the Series, 1 ~ 2 ~ 3 ~ 4 ~ 5, &c. 1 ~ 2 ~ 3 ~ 4 ~ 5, &c. 1 ~ 2 ~ 3 ~ 4 ~ 5 ~ 6, &c 1 ~ 2 ~ 3 ~ 4 ~ 5, &c. whereof the 1rst is to contain as many Terms, as there Units in the 1rst Index m-n; the 2d as many as there are Units in the 2d Index h; the 3d as many as there are Units in the 3d Index p; the 4th as many as there are Units in the 4th Index r. But the Numerator and Denominator of this Fraction have a common Divisor, viz. the Series 1 ~ 2 ~ 3 ~ 4 ~ 5, &c. continued to so many Terms as there are Units in the 1rst Index m-n; therefore let both this Numerator and Denominator be Divided by this common Divisior, then this new Numerator will begin with m-n+1, whereas t'other began with 1, and will contain so many Terms as there are Units in h+p+r, that is so many as there are Units in the Sum of all the Indices, excepting the 1rst; as for the new Denominator, it will be the Product of 3 Series only, that is of so many as there Indices, excepting the 1rst. But if it happens withal, that n be equal to h+p+r as it always happens in our Theorem, then the Numerator beginning by m-n+1, and being continued to so many Terms as there are Units in h+p+r or n, the last Term will be m necessarily, so if you invert the Series and make that the first Term which was the Last,theNumerator will be m ~ m-1 ~ m-2 ~ m-3, &c. conntinued to so many Terms as there are Units in the Sum of the Indices of each Product, excepting the 1rst Index. There remains but one thing to demonstrate which is, that, what I have said of Powers whose Index is an Integer, may be adapted to Roots, or Powers whose Index is a Fraction; but it appears at first sight why it should be so: for, the same Reason which makes me consider Roots under the Notion of Powers, will make me conclude, that (625) that whatever is said of one may be said of t'other. However I think to give sometime a more formal Demonstration of it. See the Theorem Fig. 5.
