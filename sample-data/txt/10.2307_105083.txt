An Account of Aphyllon and Dentaria heptaphyllos of Clusius, omitted by Mr. Ray: by Mr. William Watson, F. R. S. MR. Watson presented to the Society some specimens of two plants, now in flower, which he said were not frequently found in England. One of them was the Anblatum of Cordus, or Aphyllon of John Bauhin. This plant is denominated Squamaria by Rivinus, and Dentaria crocodylia by Tabernamontanus. Linnaeus, in the Flora Suecica, calls it Lathraea caule simplicissimo, corollis nutantibus, labio inferiore trisido. Mr. Ray, in his Synopsis plantarum Angliae, takes notice of its being found near Darking in Surrey, but the plant now presented was collected near Harefield in Middlesex. The other plant offered was the Dentaria heptaphyllos baccifera of Caspar Bauhin, or Dentaria tertia baccifera of Clusius. This plant is treated of by Linnaeus, in the Hortus Cliffortianus, and by Van Royen, in the Florae Leydensis prodromus, under the appellation of Dentaria foliis inferioribus palmatis, summis simplicibus. Read April 16, 1752. This [429] This plant, which is frequently met with upon the continent of the northerly parts of Europe, has been but lately discover'd to grow in England, and that only in one place; viz. in a wood not far from Harefield in Middlesex, where it was first discover'd by Mr. Blackstone, an ingenious apothecary in Fleetstreet. This is one of those few plants omitted by the late Mr. Ray in his excellent Synopsis, which are found to be natives here; and, from their great scarcity, it is not wonderful, that they were unobserved by that great naturalist.
