An Advertisement. HEaring of great complaints of the Rot of Sheep in many parts of England; we thought,it would not be unwelcome to the Reader, to be, on such an occasion, directed, for a good and cheap way of preventing the disease,to what the Honourable Robert Boyle hath publisht in his second Tome of the Usefulness of Natural Philosophy,printed at Oxford A.1671. p. 15. The short whereof is; That a great Sheepmaster lately preserv'd his Flocks in a moist Country, when most of his neighbours lost theirs; and that he did it by the bare use of (Spanish) Salt, of which each Sheep, being first made to bleed a little under the Eye, was made to take down a small handful, two or three times (with some days of interval,) without being suffer'd for some hours to drink any thing after it. L O N D O N, Printed for John Martyn, Printer to the Royal Society.1674.
