Part of a Letter from Sir Robert Sibbald, to the Publisher, giving an account of some Stones and Plants found lately in Scotland, and of some Books now Printing there. MR Lluyde met with several curious figured Stones here, and with some Inscriptions upon the Roman Wall, and in Icolms Kill, and other places, of which it is like you may have an account from him. Of late, Mr Suherland hath discovered all our Gold Coins very well, from King James the First the beginning of his Reign, till King Charles the Second, he gives their Size, their Value, their Weight and their Face and Reverse, with the Inscriptions upon them. He found last Summer several curious Plants growing Wild in Ana andale, some he had not seen before. I am told Dr Pitcairn his Writings with Additions, are to be published in one Volume in Quarto, in Holland. We are about the Christian Poet Sedulius (694) us Scotus de Mirabilibus Dei, with Notes, from a Manuscript of 700 years antiquity ~ we have here in the Lawyers Library, and if it be well received, Arator another Christian Poet will be reprinted from an old Manuscript I have Printed by Sam. Smith and Benj. Walford, Printers to the Royal Society,at the Princes Arms in St Paul's Church-yard. 1700.
