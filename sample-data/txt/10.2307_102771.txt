The Dimension of the Solids generated by the Conversion of Hippocrates's Lunula, and of its Parts about several Axes, with the Surfaces generated by that Conversion, by Ab. De Moivre, F. R. S. L Et B C A (Fig. 1.) be an Isoscelles Triangle right angled at C. with the Center C, and distance CB, describe the Quadrant B F A; on B A, as a Diameter, describe a Semicircle B K A; the Space comprehended between the Quadrantal arc B F A, and the Semicircumference B K A, is call'd Hippocrates's Lunula. If upon B C you take my two Points D, E,and draw the Perpendiculars D H,E M, meeting B A in I & L,and cutting a Portion F G M H of the Lunula; the Solid generated by the conversion of this Portion about the Axis B C, is equal to a Prism where Base is I L M H,and height the Circumference of a Circle whose Diameter is B C; and the Solid generated by the Semicircle B K A, is equal to a Prism or Semicylinder, whose base is the Semicircle B K A, and height the Circumference of a Circle whose Diameter is B C. Having bisected B A in R, and B C in P, the Surface generated by the conversion of the Arc H M about the Axis BC,is equal to crx B P x H M ~ B R x D E (supposing the ratio of the radius to the Circumference to (625) to be as r to c) and the Surface generated by the Semicircumference B K A is equal to a Rectangle whose base is the summ of that Semicircumference and Diameter B A, and height the Circumference of a Circle whose Diameter is B C. As for the Surface generated by the arc G F, 'tis well known, that it is equal to a Rectangle whose base is the Circumference of a Circle whose Radius is B C, and height D E; Therefore the Surface generated by the Conversion of the Portion M H F G is known. If upon B A (Fig. 2.) you take any two Points I, L, and draw I N, L V perpendicular to it, cutting the Quadrant in O and T, and the Circumference in N and V, the Solid generated by the conversion of the Portion O N U T about theAxis B A,is equal to a Prism whose Base is I O T L, and height the Circumference of a Circle whose Diameter is B A. Having bisected B A in R, and drawn C R meeting the Quadrant in G, the Surface generated by the Conversion of the Arc O T about B A is equal to crx CGx IL CRxOT. Bisect D E in Y (Fig. 1.) through the Center R draw S Q parallel to B C, meeting the Circumference B K A in S, B K parallel to A C in V,and the Lines D H, E M in N and O; the Solid generated by the Conversion of the Portion F G M H about the Axis A C, is crx 1/3MO3--1/3NH~ ~ PCx NOMH ~ CY x DNOE--1/3 EG3 ~ 1/3 ~, and the Solid generated by the Segment KBS is crx ~ VK 3 ~ PC x BUKS. Therefore the Solid generated by the semicircle B K A about A C is crx PC ~ VQAK ~ ~ x BCQV--1/3 AC3 ~ 2/3 VK3 ~ PC x BVKS. which by due reduction will be found equal to the <inferred>Solid</inferred> generated by the Conversion of the same Semicircle about the Axis BC. The (626) The Solid generated by the Portion O N V T about the Axis C D, is equal to cr x 1/3 LV3 1/3 IN3 1/3 QT~ ~ 1/3 PO3 ~ CS x PQIL. From the Points M, H, drop the two perpendiculars MZ, HW, upon CA prolong'd if need be; the Surface generated by the Conversion of the Arc HM about the Axis CA is equal to cr x PC x HM RA x WZ, when the point Z is next to C,or cr x PC x H~MRA x WZ when the point W is next to it. Those that will think it worth their while to bestow some little pains to find the Demonstration of this, may solve the following Problem. Any two Conic Sections being given, forming a Lunula by their Intersection, and a right line being given by position, about which, as an Axis, this Lunula is imagined to turn, to find the Solids generated by the Conversion of any of its parts, cut off by lines perpendicular to that axis, or parallel to it, or making any given Angle with it, as also the Surfaces made by that Conversion.
