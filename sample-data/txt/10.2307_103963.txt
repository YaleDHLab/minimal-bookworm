F E L L O W of the R O Y A L S O C I E T Y of L O N D O N, A N D M E M B E R of the R O Y A L A C A D E M Y of S C I E N C E S at P A R I S, &c. Honoured S I R, A N Address to You in English needs no Apology, Since it is well known to all, who have the Happiness of an intimate Acquaintance with You, that not only the * English, D E D I C A T I O N. English, but likewise all the other European Languages, in which any Pieces valuable for the Improvement of Learning have been published, are alike familiar to You. The Honour You have done me in communicating to the R O Y A L S O C I E T Y through my Hands those curious and elaborate Experiments you made upon Quicksilver, cannot be acknowledged by me in a fitter Manner, than by dedicating to You this Thirtyninth Volume of Philosophical Transactions: which likewise gives me an Opportunity of publickly thanking You for the many Marks of Friendship and Esteem I have received at your Hands, for the Civilities You have always shewn my Friends, and the Honour You have done me in continuing an Epistolatory Correspondence ever since I left Leyden. I reckon it a great Happiness, the having been near five Years one of your Pupils, during which Time You were so kind as to direct D E D I C A T I O N. direct and advise me in all my Studies; and I gratefully own, that it was You who first led me into those Philosophical Researches, which have since procured me the particular Favour of our Worthy President, and the great Honour conferred upon me by Him, the Council and Fellows of the R O Y A L S O C I E T Y, in chusing me One of their Secretaries. Were these Volumes published in the Name of the R O Y A L S O C I E T Y, they would not require the Patronage of any Particular Person; a Sanction from that Illustrious Body, which hath all along so justly been in the highest Esteem among the Learned, would be a sufficient Protection for the Publisher: But, as they contain only some of the Papers which have been read at their Assemblies, the publication of which is left to the Discretion of the Secretaries, the Editor becomes answerable for what he communicates to the Publick; therefore, as to the Share I have had in collecting and publishing these Memoirs, I beg Leave to apply to You for Protection, who are a thorough D E D I C A T I O N. thorough Judge of their Usefulness, and who have, by your universal Knowledge, deservedly obtain'd a Place in the first Rank of Learned Men. I hope You will accept this as a Token of the most sincere Respect and highest Regard, which I shall ever retain for You, being, S I R, Your most obliged, L O N D O N, Aug. 1. 1738. and most devoted, humble Servant, C R O M W E L L M O R T I M E R, M.
