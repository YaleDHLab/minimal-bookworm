C 161 ] XI. Analysis of the Roots of Equations. By the Rev. R. MURPHY, MA., Fellow of a aus College, Honorary Member of various Philosophical Societies. Communicated by J. W. LUBBOCK, Esq. FR.S. Received April 6,-Read April 27, 1837. 1. THE object of this memoir is to show how the constituent parts of the roots of algebraical equations may be determined, by considering the conditions under which they vanish, and conversely to show the signification of each such constituent part. 2. In equations of degrees higher than the second the same constituent part of the root is found in several places governed by the same radical sign, but affected with the different corresponding roots of unity as multipliers. 3. The root of every equation, of which the coefficients are rational, contains a rational part, for the sum of the roots could not otherwise be rational. This rational part, as such, is insusceptible of change in the different roots of the same equation, consequently its value is the coefficient of the second term (with a changed sign) divided by the number of roots, or index of the first term. 4. The supposed evanescence of any of the other constituent parts implies that a relation exists between the roots; if such a relation be expressed by equating a function of the roots to zero, that constituent part will be the product of all such functions, and a numerical factor. 5. The joint evanescence of various constituent parts implies the co-existence of various relations between the roots, and thus an interpretation may be given to each of the constituent parts, riveting the expression of the root in the memory, and beautifully converting the solution of a problem into a condensed enunciation of various theorems. For simplicity these principles are first applied to equations of lower degrees. 6. Let us take for example the general quadratic equation x2 + ax + b, the two roots. of which are represented by XI) x2 in the formule, 1i--g + Va a a = 2 4 To find a suppose 06 0, a relation is then established between the quantities xl and a2, viz. to^= 0, MnCccxxxvII. 162 MR. MURPHY ON THE ANALYSIS OF THE ROOTS OF EQUATIONS. xx2 vanishing with M is a factor of it; and since the roots must be symmetricaQy involved in a., the other factor is x2x1, whence k (xI2)2where k is simply a number. a Put for its expression in terms of the roots, and we thus have XI = 2 X+ xi 2 4 A xk5m Xl + X2 XlA XiX2 _ V4k, whence x1i-X2 =(V1 X2) V 4 k, or k-= then _ 2 (XI4 (1 2 which is a symmetrical function, and therefore easily expressed by the coefficientsse 7. From this it follows that a = 0 is the condition that the equation may have two equal roots; but if the proposed quadratic be represented by p = 0, and its derived equation by p' Q)9 which is the same as 2 x + a = 0, the condition for two equal roots is obtained by eliminating x between these equations, which by the theory of elimination gives as the sought condition P1 (xI) . (X2) = 0 we have thus a ka' lp' (XI) P' (X2) k' being numerical. Now p (x) = (x x) (x -X2), therefore I' (v) = (x ) + (X x2), whence 1 ' (X1) = X1-X e (X2)=X2X1 consequently k' -; and converting the sum and product of XI, x2 into the coefficients, we obtain TV=-g + 7 4 -b 2 = e (4 b8. The constituent parts in the roots which have been the objects of investigatiout a were and o, and with respect to their evanescence we have the following theorem. The vanishing of that part of the root of a quadratic which is under the radicalJ sign implies the existence of two equal roots. The vanishing of the other part which is unaffected by that sign signifies that the roots are equal, but with contrary signs. By the aid of this theorem we shall be able to find two of the three constituent parts of the roots of a cubic equation. MR. MURPHY ON THE ANALYSIS OF THE ROOTS OF EQUATIONS. 163 9. Let us now extend the same views to equations of the third degree, and let X 2x3bethethreerootsofthecubicx3+a 2+bx+c=O. Put -a + +07 X' = -+V+Y3 a e= + 02/ + Air-. The numbers 4, 4 are the imaginary cube roots of unity, and we may observe that the formula for x3, rv differ only from that for x2 in having 42, 43 respectively instead of 4. 10. The quantities a, j3, which are obviously similarly involved, are the roots of a quadratic, and of the forms M=d+ Val' al = a/ all; the three quantities 4, a' and a!l are the constituent parts of the roots of the cubic 3 ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ X in the sense in which those words have been used; the first is the same as 3 and the other two can be found from the conditions of their evanescence as follows. 1 1. Suppose a!" = 0, the theorem of art. 8. gives us a = 3, whence we find x2 = X3 now x2 x3 vanishing with a!' is a factor of it; and the other symmetrical factors are x3 x2, X1 -x3, x3 xI, x x2, x2 -a, k being a number, we must therefore have a't = k (xI X2)2 (X1 X3)2 (X2 -3)2* 12. To find ac' in like manner, suppose a!' A the theorem of art. 8 before referred to, in this case makes a& =-( and the three roots of the cubic accordingly are changed to the following: a X1 = a 02) whence we readily find that 2 XI = sx + x3, therefore 2 X 2x3 is a factor of a!, and the other symmetrical factors are 2 x2 a-, and 2 x3 -2 hence if k' be a numerical factor M =(2 x, xx3) (2 x2 x3) (2 X3 -^ ); these symmetrical functions can be expressed by the given coefficients of the equation.

The constants k, k' may be easily found in various ways, perhaps the simplest means is to sueppose a' 0 O to find k, and " = 0 to find k'. If we put x3= 0 and x, = 2 x1, we have a' O., and ac" = 4 kX16, henceo = 2 X13 V/ *, = -2 x3 V/ k, and substituting in the formula for x2, we have (since a XI) 2xi=xl+x,0V12 V/k-x, 024/2 Vk 1 =@(1 .-0) /2 V k, therefore 2 V k (0)3 -3 (02 0) and 4 k (= 9 (O -2 + 0) but 1 + G + 02 = 0; therefore 14. In like manner to find k' suppose X2 = = 0, which makes ce" = 0. and cz' + 2 k' .x13, andc = a o', therefore = y + 2 x1 i/ 2 k' or -V=21c', whence 15. The preceding analysis furnishes the following formula, 3 x1= (X1 + X2 + X3) + /{ + (2 Z-, x3) (2 x2 x3) (23 x 2) ++V 3A 3 (Xi. 2)2,(x-3)2 (X2X3)2} +1 {+(2xi1-X2-X3) (2X2-xi-x3) (2x3-XI-X2) -~ 3 (x1 -x)2 (XI x)2 ( 22 2 /-(1 X2)2(I X3)(X2 X3)2 the corresponding formule for 3 x2, 3 x3 being obtained by writing 0 and 02 before the cubic radical signs. In consequence of the negative multiplier 3 under the sign of square root it is visible that this formula is not arithmetically applicable when the three roots are real and unequal, which is usually termed the irreducible case. 16. The cubic surds in the formula above given are actually extractible, which ver ifies the solution. MR. MURPHY ON THE ANALYSIS OF THE ROOTS OF EQUATIONS. 165 To this end let 2 xi X23 = A, and x2 -X=3 B, then 1 2 x2 1-XI-x3 = Gz(3 A) 2 x3 = XI(23 B A) therefore 2 (2x1 -x2-x3) (2 X2-XI 3) (2 --x X2) = 8 (A3-9 A B2). Again Xi -2 =4. (A B) xi =3 + (A + B) therefore 2 * (x1X2) (X1 X3) (X2 X3) = 8-(A2 -B3) the total quantity under the first cubic surd thus becomes 4. {A3 + 3 A2. (B V 3) + 3 A. (B V 3)2 + (B V -3)3 the cube root of which is I {A + B V 3}, and the actual root of the second surd is similarly 4 {A B V 3}. But 2.(A + B -3) X1-x2 2-4/-3 e= X1 + x2 02 + X3 0. And (A-B V-3) =xj+x2d+X3d; the formulav of this solution become then those of VAUDERMONDE, viz. 3 x1 = (X1 + X2 + X3) + (X1 + X2 02 + X3 0) + (X1 + X2 0 + x3 02) 3 x2 = (X1 + X2 + X3) + (X1 D + X2 + X3 02) + (X 02 + x2 + X3 0) 3 x3 = (X1 + x2 + X3) + (X1 02 + X2 0 + X3) + (X1 0 + X2 02 + X3), which contain a complete verification. 17. The two constituent parts a' a&" of the roots of a cubic equation have been rek solved into factors by observing the relations established between the roots by their evanescence; another mode exists for forming the same quantities by elimination between the proposed equation and its first and second derived equations. Let the given equation x3 + a X2 + b x + c = 0 be represented by p (x) = 0, and the first derived, viz. 3 X2 + 2 a x + b = 0 by I' (x) = 0, the second derived 6x + 2a = 0 by@ " (x) 0. 166 MR. MURPHY ON THE ANALYSIS OF THE ROOTS OF EQUATIONS. 18. When d' = 0 we have seen that the equation p (x) = 0 has two equal roots But when p (x) = ( has equal roots, is expressed by making the result of eliminating x between p (x) = 0 and q' (x) = 0 to vanish, and by the theory of elimination this result is p' ('x1) . p' (x2) . f' (x3) hence we have (h being a number), all = h p't(xl) p # (2) * pt (3). 19. Suppose now the joint evanescence of cg and d', the equation has then three equal roots xl = x23= 3, the system of equations a! = 0 a' 0, the first of three dimensions relative to the roots, the second of six, are therefore the two conditions necessary for the existence of three equal roots. The results of the elimination of x between p (x) = 0 p" (x) = 0 and P (x) O if ()0, give also the two conditions for three equal roots of the same dimensions as the above, with which this system is identical, we have thus, h' being numerical ast =t At p"(XI) . Art (x2) . t(X3). 20. Since P>(X = (X XI) ( X2) (X 3) ' (x) = (X X2) (XX3) + (x -x) (x -x3) + (X X) (X X2) p"(x) =2 (x-x3) + 2 (x2) + 2 (x-x1 )I therefore P' (XI) . Pt (X2) P t (X3) = (XX2)2 (X1 X3)2 (X2 X3)2 $" (X1) . it (X2) . p" (X3) = 8 (2 XIX2x3) (2 X2 -X3) (2 x3 2) the values of a' a' are therefore conformable to those before found, and t _ _ rBt' _L ___ 2. 3' 8 = . 33 21. In the elimination of a quantity between two equations into which that quantity enters rationally, it is in general indifferent which of the two equations is selected that its roots may be substituted for such quantity, for the dimensions of the product is the same whether we substitute the n roots of an equation of n dimensions in one of m, or the m roots of the latter in the former of n dimensions, and take the products; these products are not only of the same dimensions but imply the coexistence of the same system of equations, and can only differ from each other by numerical multipliers, when the numerical coefficient in the one differs from that of the other. In the present instance, if t MS be the roots of the equation qV = 0, and X that of t= 0, the values of d all may also be expressed in the following form, all -H v (it) . p (it) allK . p (X) the factors H, K being numbers. 22. Now if we observe that by the equation pt (t) = 0, t: 2 2 a . b 1=as * 1MR.

Expressions for ae', ca" having been found by various methods, we have also the following properties with respect to their evanescence, ai 13 + V (a'+ Va" s) +V/(oa'Va"~t). When the quantity (a") under the quadratic and cubic radicals vanishes, the proposed equation has two equal roots. When the quantity (a') under the cubic but not under the quadratic surd vanishes, two of the three differences of the roots are equal, or one root is one half the sum of the other two. When both these quantities (a', a") vanish conjointly, the given equation has three equal roots. Conversely when the proposed has two equal roots the equation of condition is a" = 0, vhen it has three equal roots the two equations of condition are az' = 0, az" = o0 168 MR. MURPHY ON THE ANALYSIS OF THE ROOTS OF EQUATIONS. When the quantity () in the expression for the root which is unaffected by surds vanishes, one root is equal to the sum of the other two with changed signs. When-and or" vanish conjointly, two of the roots are each one half of the third with a changed sign. a When and a' vanish jointly, the equation has two roots equal, but with con, trary signs, and the third root is zero. Whena', all vanish simultaneously, the three roots are equal to each other and to zero. 24. Biquadratic Equations.-Let x1 X2, TX31 xbe the four roots of the equation x4 + ax3 + bx2 + cx + d, the number 4 being composite allows the subdivision of the sumns of the roots taken two and two into three pairs, which have rational suns, thus XI+t o,2=-(3+ + + X) t 3+c ) (X2 + X4t + ) XI +X4+ 2 -(2?x3?+ ) therefore the equation, of which the roots are a a X 4+a l 4+a X1 + 2+ 1+X 3+ + X, 1 + X4 + -t (3+ + &c) is one of six dimensions, but without terms involving the odd powers of the unknOWr' quantity, and therefore these quantities are the square roots of the roots of a cuhicY equation.

Suppose oi" O., then by art. 23 two of the roots of the cubic are equal, or ( 3= ry from whence we have X3 = x4, therefore x3 x4 is a factor of a"', and forming all the other symmetrical factors, we have a"' = k (x1 -x2)2 (X1 X3)2 (XI X4)2 (X2 x3)2 (X2 X4)2 (X3 -x4)2 k being a numerical multiplier. 26. Next suppose c' = 0, then by the properties of the roots of the cubic already demonstrated we have 2 o = (3 + r, or o ( 3 y v, whence (V/o+ VO3) (V V) (y+ VCM ('yVa) therefore (X X4) (X2 -3) (XI Xx3) (X4 X2) one factor of a"' is found thus to be (xI x4) (X2 X3) + (XI x3) (X2 X4) The two remaining symmetrical factors are (xI X2) (X3 X4) + (XI X4) (X3 X2) (X1 -X3) (X4 -X2) + (X -X2) (X4 x3) and ac" is the product of all three multiplied by a numerical factor k'. 27, Again, suppose C' = 0, then by the article above referred to a + ( + y 0; but (3+ r (X X2)2 + (Xa3 )2 + = (X1 X3)2 + (X2-X4)2 + = (X _ X4)2 + (x2 X)2 the sum of which being per se symmetrical, shows that ca' has no other but a numerical factor; therefore Mc' = ic" {(x1 _2)j (X(.: ) (.,p r (X'2-x4)2 + X_42 MDCCCXXXVII. z 170 MR.

But since x + r(x1 v) + (X2 -4) and (+? = (XI X4)2 + (x29) therefore = 2 (xI x4 X1 x3 + X2 x3 2 X4) -2 (x1 X2) (X4 X3) Similarly a oy and (-y are expressed, and comparing the expression for a"' thus arising with that found before, we have MIII 24 -22 . 33 a&'t' 26 .

When v,"' = 0. the proposed equation which it will be convenient to express by p (x) = 0 has two equal roots, the condition for which is also obtained bv eliminating x between p (x) = 0 and the first derived A' (x) = 0, the function of the coefficients arising from this elimination is of the same dimensions, and expresses the same condition as the constituent quantity v,"', and therefore only differs from it by a numerical multiplier. This quantity in a symmetrical form relative to the roots is therefore MM = h . PI (a"I 3 . @ (X2) o PI (X3) e P) (X4) and since PI (XI) = (X1 X2) (X1 -X3) (X1 X4) we have the same result as by the former method and h = k. 30. When I'" vanishes jointly with sc/"', then since tx= (3y we have also MR. MURPHY ON THE ANALYSIS OF THE ROOTS OF EQUATIONS. 171 n-T'2_X3= X4, therefore the equation p (x) = 0 has three equal roots, and since a"' = 0 denotes the existence of two equal roots, therefore ac" = 0 is the additional condition for a third, or the system of equations ae" = 0, al"l = 0 are equivalent to the system (x) = 0, I' (x) = 0, P" (x) = 0. Now =( )= 6 x2 + 3 ax + 6 = z + b for abridgment, we shall next form an equation in z indicative of two equal roots, and eliminating z by the equation z + b 0 we shall obtain &a". When x1=2' then 6 XI2 +3 ax1 6x2-3x,(2x1x3 +x4) 3 (x1 x3 + X1 x4) 3 (X1I X3 + X2 X4) the equation z + 3 (X1 X3 + X2 X4) = 0 expresses that x1= and forming a cubic equation by taking all the symmetrical simple equations, a condition in % for the existence of any pair of equal roots is obtained, viz. F(z)={z+3(xl3+x2x4)}.{z+3(X1 X2 + X3X4)}.{z+3(14+2x3)} 0 F (z) = Z3 + 3 b z2 + 9 (a c 4 d) z + 27 {d (a2 4 b) + e2} = 0; and if z be eliminated between this equation, and z + b = 0, the result multiplied by a constant will be ad or cl-l h'F (-b). Now one factor of F(b) = 2 (X x3 + x2x4) (x x2+xx4+x23+x3x4) = (X1 X2) (X3 X4) + (X1 X4) (X3 X2) ; the other two being symmetrical with it gives the same value of a" as before, and h'= k'. 31. If ol = 0 = a"0,' d 0 simultaneously, then x2 = X2 X3 =4A Nowa' 'is a function of two dimensions, as is that arising by eliminating x between p" (x) = 07 (x) = 0, and gives the same condition, but 'p"' (x) = 6 (4 x + a), therefore a" (-i) is the result of this elimination, therefore a h' = h" p" (--4-). Now P" (x) = 2 (6 X2 + 3 a x + b) therefore p" (a) 2 b 3 a, 4 4~~~ a and our former value of a' is k" { 3 x122 x1 x2} = i" (3 a2 8 b) hence It" = -4 ic". z 2 172 MR.

The condition '"= 0 denotes the following relation of the roots (x1 X4) (X2 T3) + (X1 X3) (x2 x4) = 0. The system of coexisting conditions a" = 0, a"' 0 are necessary and sufficient for the existence of three equal roots. The condition oa' = 0 denotes the following relation of the roots, I (X1 -x2)2 = 0. The simultaneous system of conditions os' = 0, osf = 0, a"= 0 essentially and suffix ciently express the coexistence of four equal roots. a The rational part of the root -4 only vanishes with the sum of the roots. 34. We now proceed to determine the constituent parts of the roots of equations of the fifth degree by the conditions of their evanescence. 4, 42 represent the imaginary cube roots of unity. & 2 W3, w4 the imaginary fifth roots of unity.

Suppose aIv = 0. then by art. 33 two roots of the biquadratic must be equal. First let y = 6, which can only happen under the five following relations, V/ 7t = V n V r = V 2 V 7 / V M V r = W4 V , V r ; V , whfich furnish five factors, linear functions of the differences of the roots, and since 174 MR. MURPHY ON THE ANALYSIS OF THE ROOTS OF EQUATIONS. these differences may be taken either way, we have also from the same equations five other factors equal to the former and with contrary signs. In this manner ten factors of a=v may be found by equating any pair of the four quantities a, P, ry ~, and the number of pairs being six, the whole number of factors of al is sixty, these factors are very easily formed, and here we present the first thirty factors, the remaining thirty being formed merely by changing the signs of these, or, vhich is the same, inverting the order of the differences of the roots in each factor. 37. For greater clearness we shall subdivide these thirty factors into five groups, from the first of which xi is excluded, from the second x2, and so on; each subdivi. sion contains six factors, four of which are of one form, and two of a different form they are as follow: (x2 X4) +~ (X3 -X4) + 0 (X3-X5) o (1oV (X3 -X2) +w (X5-X2) + 2(5_4) * * * * (2.)

The factors in the group A of the preceding article denote for abridgment by their number placed as a subindex to A, and so for all the others, thus by B3 is neant the third factor in the group B. The quantity a"' is composed of the three factors of ten dimensions each. Every such factor is the sumi of two parts, each decomposable into ten simple factors. In the first pair of these simple factors x1 does not enter, in the second pair xa :s excluded, and so on.

It remains to give the value of the constants k, k VI, k"', which may be easily found by comparison of the above values with the constituent parts of the roots of a biquadratic; they are as follows: k{c(o 1 60 Q4 k= -V -J \(w 5) / Q24. 33 k"' 1 X1 X2 + X3 + X4 + XS and the term uninfluenced by surds is X' 43. All the constituent parts except the last-mentioned vanish when all the roots ale equal, but for their separate evanescence the condition for the equality of roots is insufficient, the requisite conditions are easily seen from the factors of such parts already given; they are of two classes, arising from the different relations of the couples { (a, W2), (om, a3), (,3, G4), (w3, w4) }, and of the two couples {(W2, W3), (S, W4)}, each member of which contains the same imaginary part with the other, which is not the case with the former couples. 44. 1 cannot at present, from thepressure of other engagements, pursue these investigations further; if any additional light to the analyst is furnished by the preceding imperfect reflections on a subject so often treated, the author's object will in a great measure be attained; they at least tend to show the imperfection of our MDcccxxxVHT 2 A 178 MR.
