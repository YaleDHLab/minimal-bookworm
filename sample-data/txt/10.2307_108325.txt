[ 449 I XXI. Contributions to the Chemistry of the Urine. PART II.-On the Variations in the Alkaline and Earthy Phosphates in Disease. By HENRY BENCE JONES, M.A., Fellow of the Royal College of Physicians. Communicated by THOMAS GRAHAM Esq., F.R.S., 8c. Received January 22,-Read April 2, 1846. On the Variations in the Earthy and Alkaline Phosphates in Disease. THE object of the following experi'ments was to show to what extent the amount of phosphatic salts was increased in disease. Unexpectedly, during the investigation the diminution of the amount became of equal interest. I have found no analyses undertaken for the solution of these questions, some of Sir C. SCUDAMORE's alone being excepted; and these are so made that it is impossible to compare them with those which will here be given. Though Dr. PROUT long since remarked that excess of phosphates accompanied some affections of nervous structures, yet no analytical results were stated, and the observation seems to have referred to the earthy phosphates alone. I have in vain as yet sought for some immediate method for approximately determining the total amount of phosphatic salts in the urine. An analysis, requiring five or six hours to perform, is at present the only satisfactory process which can be recommended. . Most of the following experiments were made on the water first passed in the morning, and before food: occasionally this could not be obtained, and then the night or afternoon water was taken. Almost all the cases were in St. George's iHospital, and therefore under nearly the same circumstances, as far as exercise was concerned. The diet usually varied with the state of the patient. The details of the cases would extend beyond the limits of the present paper. Had it been possible, I should have much preferred to make mv experiments on the total quantity of urine passed during the twenty-four hours, by which means, measuring the quantity, the total amount of phosphates thrown out of the body would have been known; but I found it utterly impossible to obtain any approach to accuracy in regard to the quantity of water passed in the twenty-four hours. The results would have been so valuable, that it was only when I found by experience how uncertain and inaccurate they must be, that I gave up the plan I had formed. Instead of giving the quantity of phosphatic salts in 1000 parts of urine, of certain specific gravity, it may be thought that a comparative view would have been better taken by calculating the solid residue in each case, from some of the various tales which give the amount iMDcCCCxLv1. 3 N 450 DR. BENCE JONES ON THE VARIATIONS IN of solid residue in 1000 parts of urine of all specific gravities. But no tables admit of this calculation. They may perhaps be true for the total quantity of water in twenty-four hours; but they are not so for the water made at any one period of the day. The water made before and after dinner, for instance, may have the same specific gravity, but the total quantity of solid residue in each may be entirely different. If the urine was a solution of any single substance such tables would be useful., but where there are many substances present in varying quantities at different periods, these formula are inapplicable. In my previous paper I have shown, that in the healthy state the amount of earthy phosphates precipitable by ammonia depends chiefly on the amount of earthy matter taken into the body; the amount varying from A40 per 1000 urine, specific gravity 1027'9, to 1*49 per 1000 urine, specific gravity 1030. I have also shown that the alkaline phosphates vary from 7-56 per 1000 urine, specific gravity 1027w9, to 5.77 per 1000 urine, specific gravity 1030. In the following paper I shall attempt to show that the earthy phosphates are subject to suich great variations, depending on the water, the food, and the medicine even, that from their estimation alone no result can be arrived at. I shall then give the total amount of earthy and alkaline phosphates in diseases, in which the nervous tissues, or their neighbouring tissues, are affected. 1. In, diseases of the spine ; from accidents, caries, paraplegia. .2. In diseases of the membranes and chronic diseases of the brain. 3. In fractures of the bones of the skull. 4. In acute diseases of the brain. 5. In functional diseases of the brain as violent delirium and delirium tremens. .6. In insane patients. I shall lastly, for comparison, give the amount of earthy and alkaline. phosphates in some diseases in which the nervous tissues may be considered as unaffected. 1. In acute diseases as acute rheumatism, gout, fever. 2. In chronic diseases, as Bright's disease; diseases in which very small quantities of water are secreted ; scrofulous diseases, exostosis and mollities ossium.

Case 2 has been mentioned in the previous paper as showing the effect of sulphate of magnesia. From the other cases the amount of earthy phosphates seenied to be about the healthy standard. The general conclusion is, that the variations in the earthy phosphates are independent of the nature of the disease; and this conclusion will be found to be confirmed by the subsequent experiments.

In Case 2 also, on the 4th, 5th and 6th days, whene the head symptoms were urgent, the total amount of phosphates was considerably above the average; on the 9th day, when erysipelas camie on, no increase was seen. In this case the earthy phosphates are worthy of note. Cases 3 and 4 were severe fractures, but without acute symptoms. 454 DR.

Case 4 was most remarkable: the violent symptoms abated on the 5th day; but the post-mortem examination on the 26th day showed no positive marks of inflammatory action. On this account I have placed it in the class of functional diseases: further experiments may ultimately show, that the great increase in alkaline phosphates alone is sufficient to indicate the nature of the disease. In Cases 5 and 6 no excess of phosphates is observable. The 5th and 6th days of Case 8 are particularly remarkable. The 6S of water on the 6th morning were strongly acid to test-paper, and remained so for eight days in June. Case 9; the 5th day was most remarkable, as no alkaline phosphate was present: the urine was acid to test-paper. In the other cases of delirium treinens, when food could -be taken, the phosphates did not appear to be much affected. 456 DR.

'46 10165| 4'70 5*16 The first seven cases of diseased kidney showed no increase, even when acute inflammation was present. In Cases 8, 9 and 10, a very small quantity of urine was secreted, and there is a slight apparent increase in the amount of phosphates. The cases of scrofula were dispensary patients of Mr. TOYNBEE'S, and no increase of phosphates is observable in them. The case of exostosis was a very extreme case, and the phosphates are in about the healthy proportion. The first case of mollities was a still more severe one: there is a decided increase inl the earthy phosphates; and the alkaMDcccxtvI. 3 o 458 DR. BENCE JONES ON THE VARIATIONS IN line phosphates at the last were also in excess, though there was no symptom whatever of affection of the nervous structures. The conclusions I have drawn may be thus enumerated:Table I.-The variations in the earthy phosphates in one case, during ten successive days, appear to follow no rule. In the other cases the amount of earthy phosphates seemed to be about the healthy standard. The general conclusion was, that the variations in the earthy phosphates were independent of the nature of the disease; and this conclusion is borne out by all the other tables.. Table 1I.-In fractures of the spine and. paraplegia, the total amount of phosphatic salts was slightly above the healthy standard at the early period, when inflammatory action mnight be present; when chronic, or free from inflammation, the total quantity of phosphatic salts was lower than natural., Table 11.-In chronic diseases of the brain, and in chronic, and even acute diseases of the membranes, there was no increase of phosphates. Table IV.-In fractures of the bones of the skull, when any inflammation of the brain appeared, there was a slight increase in the total amount of phosphates. When there were no head symptoms no increase of phosphates was observed, even though otheracute inflammations supervened. Table V.-In acute inflammation of the brain there was an excessive amount of phosphates secreted: when the acute inflammation became chronic no excess was observable. Table VI.-In some functional diseases of the brain an excessive amount of phosphates was secreted; this ceased with the delirium. In other functional cases, as in fevers, no'excess was observed. Delirium tremens showed no excess or deficiency when food could be taken; but in the most violent cases, when no food was taken, the phosphates were diminished in a most remarkable degree. In one case in which, at this period, there was no alkaline phosphate, the urine was acid to test-paper. In another, in which the total quantity of phosphatic salts = 06 per 1000 urine, there was a strong acid reaction: the urine remained acid for eight days in June. Table VLI.-In the general paralysis of the insane no increase of phosphates was observed. One case of acute paroxysm of mania showed a small increase during the paroxystn. In two other cases of mania there appeared a diminution of phosphates approaching to that in delirium tremens. Table VIII.-Acute inflammations and fevers showed no increase.Table IX.-Briglht's disease, even with acute inflammation, showed no increase. Where only a few ounces of urine were secreted, as in dropsy, there was a slight apparent increase. In scrofulous diseases no increase was observed, nor in a very -ex. treme case of exostosis. In the acute case of mollities ossium there was a decided ins crease in the earthy phosphates, and, the alkaline phosphates at last were also in excess, though, there was no symptom whatever of afection ofthe ner vous structures THE EARTHY AND ALKALINE PHOSPHATES. 459 The general conclusions are:1. That acute affections of nervous substance, organic and functional, are the only diseases in which an excess of phosphatic salts appeals in the urine. In acute inflammation of the brain, the amount of phosphates seems to be proportional to the intensity of the inflammation. In some states of violent delirium the amount of phosphates may also be proportional to the delirium. 2. Thatin a large class of functional diseases of the brain, of which delirium ttemens presents the most marked examples, the amount of phosphates is most remarkably diminished. 3. That no chronic diseases whatever show any marked excess in the total quantity of phosphatic salts secreted, at least as far as this mode of analysis is conclusive. One case of mollities ossiumn formed the only exception to these rules. 30o2
