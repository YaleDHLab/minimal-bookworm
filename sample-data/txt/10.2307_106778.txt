E 99 z VI. Part of a Letter from Mr. Micllael Toppillg, to Mr. Tiberius Cavallo, F. R. Ss Read February i6, 1792. DEAR SIR, M(zdras, l;eDezlary4, I78g. I INCLOSE YOU all accoullt of a base lilae I have meastlred for a series of triangles I am carryillg dosvn the coast of Col^oX mandel. I have already extellded tllem to about goo lniles frotn Madras, arld am upon returning back to prosecute tlle work qtlite down to Cape Comorila. l'he angles are all takell with my Hadley's sextant, made by STANCLIFFE, by mealls of three ta11 signa]s I 1lave constrtlcted of baluboos, 80 feet laigll, 60 of svllicll I mount upon steps, so as to see (over all trees, &c. ) very distinctly my two other signals, at the distallce of from 8 to 13 luiles. It is, I believe, tlle filst time t:lle Hadley was ever made use of for a purpose of such magnitude; but it is fully equal to it-nay, it does more the SU11'S bearing, or oblique distance, from my signals is also takell by it; by which, and his azimutll (computed) I obtain the allgles luade by them nvith the meridiall ; and by coznbinillg the whole, the difference Of latitude, alld meridional distance of every otle of tllenz ill English fatlloms. This is fotllld so llicely, that a mean of my astronolllical observatiolls for the latitudes, 1lever differs more than a few secollds from those given by the geometrical mensuration.

(Sig,rled) M.troPPING S?a Xccount of tbe SIeasurement Qf a Base Lille upon tbe Sea Beach, near Porto NONTON on tbe Coast of Coromandel, ig Mayn 1y88y by Mr. Michael Toppiilg. As a-necessary fbuncition for tlle chain of triangles nosr carrying on, I llave, for some time past, had Iny thoughts ben-t towards measuring, with a11 possible accuracy, a base lineo lthisbase line, could I havechoWs-en its situation,$hould havebeen determinect as near the middle of the line of coast I am surveying as possible; but circumstances llave llot permitted me to xnake unrestrained choice-of its place. 0l1 toy arrival a-t Cuddalore, I was told that? as I proceecled southsrard, I shoulcl meet with firequent rivers, and otEler water courses, that would certainly obs--truct me in the desigtl I had formed of measuring it on the sea beach, farther soutla ; and, soon after my removal from that place, I:found, witla much satisfactioll, that the coast, between :Cudclalore rlver and Porto Novo, wotlld serve rny pu:rpose extremely verell. The iach hereabouts is flat, broad, and remarkably smooth; tlle only speciovis objection that can be made to it, is itsnot being straight, but forming a cur6red-line, concave tovards the sea. This, however, I kncur to be, i-ureality, ofs nobad consequence,since ,several right of a B-ase Line on the Coast of CoromandeI. O1 litles of sufficient length might, I perceived, be laleasured UpOll it; the angles they might interchangeably malie, be taken ; and tlle whole aftervslards be reduced to one dWirect line by calculation. These considerations, and an accident tlaat, about the same time, befel one of my signals, and delayed my trigonometrical progress, finally determined ne to measure my base at this opportunity; and I accordingly begall that work by placing two of my large signals, at the distance (as nearly as I could Judge) of seven miles asullder, for the terlus or extremities of it. In traversing the coust between theLsignals, I found that, in order to continue rey operations throughout upon the tnost advantageotls part of the beach I lMUSt di-vide the wl-lole distance into six distinct portiotls, each portiorl forming a large angl@ with the next portion to it: alld this I immediately did, by placing-five lesser flags, at illtervals conveni@nt for that purr pose. I now began my measurement, in prosecuting whicEl I spared neither pains rlor care. Tlle two rods, of 25 feet eaclly hich I had provided for this use had teen strictly exaluirled while I was at Cuddalore, and their lerlgths ascertairled, as exactly as the conveniences this couAltry affords wtotlld admit ofs They had been left purposely a li-ttile tcro lorlx, as I fouzd it easier to detertnine, alld allow br such excess, than to reduce then to sufficient exactness. In settling their respective lengths, a capital two-feet brass sector by ADAMS was rnade use of, as a standard: this instrument svas llOt only the best au-thority I could procure; but, being my owm property, would.> I considered, be ready for an examitlatioIln should al; opportusMr. TOPPING9S Account of tbe Measurement1.OBnity arise of comparing it, in future with any lneasure of more acknvwledged creditz The thermometer stood at X70 when the rods were adjusted by it. 7Mbe stands which I had prepared for levelling the rodss were also brollght out; and it was with much regret that I fiound I could not profit by them, as I had hoped to do, assisted as I was by none but black people, in whotn, I perceived, it would have been impossible, svithout incurring great loss of time, to have ilupressed a necessary idea of tlleir nature ancl managetment. I therefore resolved to dispense witll the stands, and to 1ay tlle rods, erld to end, upon the ground. 1t was in a similar way that the base line for a series of triangles, continued throughout France) was measured The French rodss which e7ere nearly of the same length and construction with mine, svere disposedj in the very salale rnanner upon the rug ged pavement of a highway near Paris; so that I have every reasotl to believe tlle opportullity here afforded me of a peculiarly level and sarldy beacla, to be the best of the two. The mode of conducting the measllrement was thIS:-Staves were first set up, in a direct line, between the flags ; from every two of these staves a rope was occasionally stretched, as tight as possible, on the groundv and the rods were laid by the side of the ropew The first rod being properly placed, the second was laid nedr its end, and then very carefiully adjusted, so as to touch the ferrule of the other, by a lnan, >tho hal no other employment to engage his attelltion; and in the performance of this ofEce he was closely watched by myself. The ferrulesj which were of thick brass, had been rollnded, not only to tnake tlle contact more visible, but because the length of each rod svas determined, by their having the spherical figure, lllore of a Base L-ine on the Coast of Coromandel.103easilyG At the placing of every second rod, which was painte(l white to dlistinguish it ft om the other, I registered its number myself in a book, ruled purposely writh colutulas, each column containing ten ntltnbers: my writer did the sarne in another book: besides which, an attendarlt, who was -furnished svith ten small sticksS gave tlle Tindal, who also assisted ila keeping the reckoning, one of thetn every tilue the white rocl was laid down; and each tnarl lnade his separate report to me every teIath number. By these precautiorls, almost all possibility of a mis-reckoning was prevented; and we accordingly found no disagreement throughout. The whole distarlce was afterwards re-measured, and gave correctly the same number of rous At the conclusion of each several measurement, that I might krlow exactly where to resume it, a stake, three or four feet long, was driven into the ground, till its head lvecame even with the surface. 0n the top of this stake the but of the last rod was laid; and a line drawn across it utith a pointed irlstrument, shewed precisely where to re-comluerlce the work. The heads of these stakes served likewise as fixed marks on whichg at any time, to place the five slnaller flags, or the instrutnent-for taking the requisite angles. The sum of the six measured lines amounted, by the first trial, to seven bundred double rods, twenty feet szx inches and a half; and by the second, to seren hundred double rabls, twentytwo feet elezoen inches and a hcllf; their diffierence being two feet, four inc1pes and a balf) by which the second measulement exceeded the first. The shortest of these lneasures is made use of, as operations of this nattlre ha^Ze always a terldency to excess, rather than deficiency. Mr. tOPPING'S Sscoant of th-e Mevsurementto4Besides this linear measurement seven esserltial angles were taken-(each angle several times over, for security) with an excellent theodolite by RAMSDEN. These were the angles formed, at each extretnity of the base, by the nearest intermediate flag, and the relllote sigllal; and those formed at each intermediate flag, by the nearest flag to it, on each halld. The nature and purport of a11 this will be easily understood-, by inspecting the accompanying figures Tab III. fig. . arld attending to tlze follosving explanation alld :DE1M0NST 1<AT ION e Le-t N alad S represent the llorthern allcl southern signals3 placed at each extretnity of the base line J.

These things being prenlised to filld the allgles the otlz-er bur lines make svith the base linen proceed in the following manner: Produce the line WA to 1(; also the line BA to H ; and, tllrough tlle pOillt A, draw FG parallel to NS, the base line. IXrom the poillts ABCDE let fall pelpendiculars UpOll the base line, leetillg it at OPQR and T of vBase Line on the Covst of Coromandel;tosThe angles SNA, NA1R, GAK,are all equal ; for SNA and NAF are alternate-angles, formed by a right line falling u-two paralleis (Euclid, 2gth, ost) : arld NAFn GAK, are equal angles, formed by the mutual intersection of two right lines :(Euclid tSthgg lst). l?or the same reason, the angle NAH is equal to KAB, alld HAF to GAB. Now, tlle obtuse Â«angle NAB, beirlg known (frotn obseraratioll), its supplemelat is equal to BAK mZhich, being subtracted from GAK, leaves the angle GAB require-d; bymeans of whichs and the hypothenuse AB ;(given by mensuration)) we obtaill the si(le AG oÂ£ the rightangled triangle GAB, by plane trigonometry ; for as racl.: cosine LGAB: : side AB: side AG. Tllis computed side is equal to the opposite sidexOP ofthe rectangular parallelograln DPAG, which being added to the side NO of the right-angled triangle ONA (found by the like analogy from the observed angle N) and the neasured hypvthenuse NA) gives the dis tallce EI9P orl the base lineae Proceeding irl like Illanner, Wltll the last foulld allgles to find the angles ofthe remaillillg triangles and thence their respec tive bases, we shall have the sides of the correspon(lilg rect bangles ; the sum ;of iwhich sicles, taken together, M ill be the -true measure of the base line NS. : Supposing no imperfectiorl in the instrument vitil svhcl the angles harre been taken, and no error (however small) committed in taking the sis preceding alagles, tllell the angle XES, obtained by this method, wlll prove exactly equal to the allgle NSE, wllich may be had by observation.

In tllepresent case, in order to obtain as great precision as possible, the intermediate angles have heela deduced from both ends; those at A and B, from the observation at N ; and the remaining ones at C D and E, from that at S. Had, however, this precaution beell neglected, the error induced, by deriving the four required angles frorn either primitive, at N or S, would not have a-Sected the true length of the whole base line more than ,27 of a footv or not quite so much as three itlches and a qtlarter. This xuethod of obtaining the measureEof an inaccessible line, where tlle measured lines every where make small angles M ith it, is a very accurate olle ; for though, in oblique triallglesl slnall angles, from the difficulty o-f taking atagles per-fectly, are likely to prodtlce considerable errors, in right-angled triangles it is the very reverse; as in thetn the smaller the angle taken the more accurate svill be the result.

The tablen page 1 loX gieres the results of these obseraratiotls, and the data from which tlley vere cotnputed. Nothing need be said of the two preceding tables, which sufficiently explai -thetmselsres. The last tabIe contains meridional observations of stars for determning the latitude of each respective terluinatioil of tlle base line. No observatiorls were obtained at the 1lorthern extremity the weaJcIler proving uncommoraly cloudy while I svas there; and only three latitudes were observed at the south end The others were taken at my next southern -station and reducel to 1;he terms of the base by the adjacent triangles. The diffierence of latitude between that station and the south end of thve base I found loy tneasurement to be 8201 yards, or +' 't; and the difference of latitudebetween the terms of the base St 42t.
