THe Worthy Signor Malpighi in a late Letter of his to the Publisher, of the 9th of March, takes notice, that one Signor Zagonius had a way of making out of the Bononian Stone calcined, Statues and Pictures variously shining in the dark. But he adds (to our sorrow) that that person lately died, without discovering to any body his method of preparing the said Stone.
