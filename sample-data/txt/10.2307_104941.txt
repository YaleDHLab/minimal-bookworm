An Account of the Impression on a Stone dug up in the Island of Antigua, and the Quantity of Rain fallen there for Four Years: In a Letter from the Reverend Mr. Francis Byam to William Fauquier, Esq; F. R. S. Dear Brother, Antigua, March 31, 1755. AS you have the honour to be a member of the Royal Society, I have sent you, by Captain Barrett, in a box directed for you, what I esteem to be a great curiosity. It is a stone, that was brought from a quarry, for a building in the town: the quarry is in the side of a mountain, and is about three hundred yards higher than high-water mark, and about two miles from the sea. When the mason struck it with his hammer, it split in two, and discovered the exact portraiture of a fish (on each stone) which we call an old wife. (PLATE IX.) I have likewise sent you an account of the quantity of rain, that has fallen in this place for four years last past. Read Dec. 11, 1755. [296] past. Had I had such an instrument, as Mr. Derham had, to measure the hundredth part of an inch, it would have increased the quantity greatly; but I have only taken notice of it when it amounted to the tenth part of an inch. My instrument is very simple and plain; it is a tin vessel about thirteen inches high, the aperture at top is four inches and an half square, the bottom the same; the opposite sides parallel to each other. It stands in my garden, free from the drippings of any trees or houses, and raised upon a pedestal,about two feet from the ground. You will observe a x in September 51, and September 54. In these months we had hurricanes. If any thing of this kind would be agreeable to you, or the Society, I shall take great pleasure in communicating them, when in my power. I am, dear brother, Your affectionate brother, March 31, 1755. F. Byam. A TABLE of the Rain, which has fallen in Antigua, from 1751 to 1754. 1751 Inch. Tenths 1752 Inch. Tenths 1753 Inch.
