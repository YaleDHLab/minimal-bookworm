1. 335 2 XXV. On the fuents of irrational functions. By Edward Ffrench Bromhead, Esq. M. A. Communicated by J. F. 'W. Herschel, Esq. F. R. S. Read June 4, 18i6. H E efforts of analysts in determining the fluents of rational functions, have been completely successful, and their labours form one of the most perfect and beautiful branches of the fluxionary calculus. In the irrational functions however, we find but little effected. With the exception of WARING, modern analysts have not added any thing important, to the forms given by NEWTON, CRAIG, COTES, and BERNOULLI. No attempt has been made to generalize the known forms, and the last eminent writer on the subject, LA CRoIX, seems to consider them as independent results, not deducible from any common principles, and refers us to the Petersburgh Acts, and other miscellaneous Collections. In the following pages, it is attempted to generalize and systematize our knowledge on this subject; and to show that all the known forms result from other forms of the greatest extent, not depending on particular functions, but upon the properties of all rational functions whatever. R, R, R, R, denote rational functions of any kind; R:-', R'7 X Z n X R1Ad, R` their inverse functions, Thus if x R (v) any rational function of (v), then v,= RII (x) the inverse function. Mr. BROMHEAD On thefluents of It is thought unnecessary to prove, that the fluxions of all rational functions, and all rational functions of them, are themselves rational. PROP. 1. dx .

The cases are very few, in which the difficulty can be overcome, and perhaps the following Propositions will be found to include all the instances, in which analysts have effected the reduction.

Should all the artifices in the -foregoing propositions fail, Ye must attempt to resilve thre fluxion itml) a series o-f terms, such that each term may be separately rationalized. This is irrationalfu nctions. 345 often possible, when the original function does not admit a rational expression, and can be effected sometimes directly, and sometimes by introducing a new variable. But it will first be necessary to reduce all irrational functions whatever to a definite form. LEMMA. To reduce all irrational functions to a definite form. 1. By successively multiplying numerators and denominators into the same expressions, every irrational function may at last be reduced to a series of terms, whose numerators and denominators do not contain any fraction or negative index. Thu (c+ jnm~ Thus + . (acW 4 b)and if a, N. y, a, b, c, are ( a + bc-n)m t a 4. b )m functions involving fractions or negative indices, themselves, the reduction is Continued in the same manner. 2. Now multiply both the numerators and denominators of the expressions so reduced, by s uch multipliers, as will render the denominators rational. This factor is the product of all the different values of the denominator, with the exception of the denominator itself. The new numerators will still consist of a series of terms not involving any fraction r 0 negative index. 3. If R, R, R) &c. denote functions of the form cxg + c . tmv + .. , the irrational takes the form, R (x) R(x) a c R (x) a R)+ R )* (X) b P (X) d...+ R() X(X) ... -I 3 5 4. By reducing the fractional indices of the factors to the 046 Mr. BROMHEAD on thefluents of common denominator (n), the whole will consist of a series ot R (x) terms R e ( (x)p.9((X)q... 3 5. By expanding all the integer powers under the index and again reducing the indices of the sums and products, which are under it, to a common denominator n'; we shall by continuing the same operations, ultimately reduce the whole expression, to a series of terms of the form R R(x) .f R (X) v S1i/ Sas/ * e S R (x/ m S denoting the sum of any number of terms such as follow it, wherein R (x) may be different in each term, but always of the form CXm + c +m-I e*6. If every value of R (x) contains a factor (ax r + bxr-I +A..) X* n ". *X, it may be taken entirely out of the radical; and conversely the rational coefficient may be introduced entirely under the radical. 7. When the surd is so reduced, that no rational factor can be withdrawn from the radical, it is said to be in its lowest terns; and is said to be an irrational of the ill, 2d, or vt order, according to the number of the indicesI, ? n no, .'...L Thus the general expression for a surd of the first 71 order R (x) t is a series of terms, , V CXMn + CXm-I + 8. A more convenient general form for all irrationals, than irrationalfunctzions. 347 the series of terms above exhibited, may readily be found; by introducing all the rational parts entirely under the radicals; by reducing the indices of all the terms to a common denominator A; by expanding all integer powers; and by again reducing all the products and sums contained under K to indices with a common denominator a'. These operations continued, will ultimately lead to the expression S V'S V ~~~ ~ (x) R (4) S 8/S s/...S w/X ,whereR )may be of any different values in the different sums, but always of the form ax + ax + . bx1 + bxg X R (x) is said to be of Mdimensions ; and if a-2 be dimensions of that rational part, whose dimensionsare greatest; then the dimensions of the whole irrational are io.

Should the above processes for rendering the fluxioe rational fail Lus,7 we must attempt the fluxion at once in its irrational state, for which purpose I shall add a few miscellaneous observations, 1. If @ (x), q (x) be any algebraic functions, d q (x) then djq (x) + log. 5 (x)} = dp (x) + -~-) i an algebraic expression. Whenever, therefore, we meet with an 350 WMr. BROMHEAD on thefluetWs of algebraic fluxion, we may legitimately try P (X) + log. p (x) as a form to which the fluent may possibly belong%* 9. It presents three cases: ist. where the fluent is wholly algebraic, for which we assume some expression so general, that its fluxion will include the given fluxion, if it admit an algebraic fluent;y or we find the fluent implicitly by an equation: 2dly. where the fluent is mixed, when we attempt to separate the algebraic part: 3dly. where the fluent is purely logarithmic, when we assume, as in the first case, some expression with indeterminate constants, sufficiently general to include the given fluxion. A. In assuming for an algebraic fluxion, it must be observed, that the fluent will always be a surd of the same order as the fluxion. On this principle WARING gives some assumptions for surds of the second order, but nothing has been attempted generally for surds of all orders, for want of some definite form which should include them all. In irrationals of the first order, the fluxion may always be reduced to series of terms, such as dx.(x + a x + a * + a where the factors are all different, and where the indices are positive, negative, fractions, integers, or unity. Then let R (x) be any expression cx -I + cxam + e e with indeterminate coefficients. Assume for the fluent (x ) +1) ( R (x) n-i * It is obvious, that the fluent of an algebraic fluxion cannot be of the form dp (x) 9 (T) + P (x) . log. p (4), for its fluxion do (X) + do (x) . log. 0 XJ + 2X x q (Xi is a transcetdent, irrationa/iunclions 1 Its fluxion will be DR (x).

By equating the terms in this equation, the indeterminates c, c, c, &c. may be found; but the reduction will I 2 often be impossible, as there are more equations to be satisfied than there are indeterminates. 4. If any index ae, jy = -i, the expression fails, and there is no algebraic fluent; also WARING says, that if the dimensions of a fluxional coefficient be= i, the fluent cannot be algebraic. 5. If (x) be an irrational function, let z =fdx . @ (x) -f dx. v; then since R x, v } o, there are cases, where we can determine, R x, z} = * 6. If o (x), w (x) be irrational functions of ., we have Jdxo (x) dx . q5 (t) + 7r (X)} ' (') Now let i (x) be so assumed, thatSee 1hil.

If therefore 7P (X) be a simpler expression than m (x), the fluxion will be reduced to a simpler form. In order to find vr (X); (x) is assumed with Indeterminate coefficients, so that its fluxion may be of the same form as dxG. P (x). Now equate the similar terms in the two expressions, and the indeterminates may be found. But as there may be more equations than indeterminates, we add X (x) a function of the same form, and containing indeterminates of sufficient number, to satisfy all the deficient equations. We shall thus have Dp (x) = q (x) + x (x and ..(x)f dx. { (x) + X (x)} by which the difficulty may be reduced to findingfdx . X (x). Reductions of particular kinds were discovered by SIMPSON and others, but this is universally applicable. 7. It mnay be of advantage to reduce the index of the variable under the radical, which may sometimes be effected. In dx . 1,m+ +I}zl assume xm+n +1 =v ; Then we have m~nnVX I m dx . {a + i } -m dv . v 1) And in the same manner surds of one order may be transformed into another. 8.

(x+ c)7f. 4 irrationai fincdior$ S 9.I shall conclude by observing that the fluxion may ab ways be made rational, if the fluent be wholly algebraic or wholly logarithmic. Thlus, if p (x) be any algebraic function, take X ,-1 R (v), Thend(x) =d(qqpF R(v)) dR (v) and dd (log. (x) =d log. Ad R (v) = R (v) are both rational. If the fluent be of. the mixed form P\ (x) + log. q7 (iv), its fluxion may be made rational, if RI 1, I~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ can be so assumed that p-I R (x) =R (x); and it may x X always be effected by introducing two new variables. First let x p-x R (v), and the fluxion becomes d( 9-rR (7.) dR (v) 4 -,( , now let v = Rpc-' R (z), an -IR~~~~~~~~~~~~~~v)~~~~~~ d R(z) we get d R (v) 4 -2(a which is wholly rational. EDWARD FFRENCH BROMHEAD. Note.-A modern analysts have in general confounded the fluxions, either with the increments or the derived functions, it may not be superfluous to state precisely, what is meant by the symbols d and D. If it be possible, (which must be shown 'in each particular case) to expand p (x + v) in the form 9 (x) + 9 (x). + 9 (X) . v + .. then 9 (x) is called the derived function of v (x), and its relation to (x) is thus expressed, 9 (x) =Do (x). Hence, if X be considered a function of itself, we have (x + v) (x) + D () . v, and D (x)4 1. Now to avoid a constant reference to the variable x, of which other variables are considered as functions, we introduce fluxions.
