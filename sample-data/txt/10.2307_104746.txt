[688] XXXIX. The Postscript of a Letter from Mr. Nath. Downe to the Hon. Mr. Greenville, concerning an Earthquake felt at Bridport, on March 18. 1749-50. S I R, Bridport, March 19. 1749. Y E S T E R D A Y Morning the Sun shone very bright; which, between 11 and 12, was with thick dark Clouds so obscured, as render'd it darker than common. Soon after, a violent Clap of Thunder, and a heavy Shower of Hail, succeeded: After which it grew again serene; and in the Evening about 6, a Shock of an Earthquake was felt in this Town, and the neighbouring Villages, with (thro' Mercy) no other Damage than a great Surprize to all who felt it. I am, S I R, Your most obedient, and very humble Servant, Nath. Downe. XL. Read May 10. 1750.
