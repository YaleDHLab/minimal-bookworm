A Receit for the Curing of Castorium, according to the method us'd in Russia. TAke the Beaver Stones and get the Milk out of them as clear as you can, then set upon the Fire a Skillet or Kettle with water, big enough to contain the quantity of Stones you have to cure: let the water Boil, and put into it half a shovel full of clean Wood Ashes, then tie the Stones together in couples and put them into the water, and let them Boil therein for half a quarter of an Hour. Then take some Birch-Bark and lay it on G 2 the (502) the Fire, and let the Stones be well smoaked over it for the space of an hour, until they are well dried in the smoak; then hang them up in a Kitchen or in the Air for a week or more, until they are perfectly dry and hard, after which they may be pack'd up in a Cask or otherwise for Transportation. If there be more Stones than will conveniently go into the Skillet or Kettle, you may make another boiling of them, and add a proportion of fresh Ashes and order them as before.
