147J VII, The Application of a Method of Differences to the Species of Series whose Sums are obtained by Mr. Landen, by the Help of impossible Quantities. By Mr., Benjamin Gompertz. Communicated by the Rev. Nevil Maskelyne, D. D. Astronomer Royal, F. R. S. Read February 13, 18o6. HAVING some years back, when reading the learned Mr. LANDEN'S fifth Memoir, discovered the manner of applying a method of differences, to-the species of series whose sums are there obtained by the help of impossible quantities, and having since extended that application, I now venture to offer it to the consideration of others. The practice of this method, in most cases, appears to me extremely simple; and on that account, I am almost induced to imagine, that they have already been considered by mathematicians; indeed since the greatest part of this Paper was written, I met with EULER'S Institutiones Calculi integralis two simple series are in that work summed by multiplications similar to those employed in the investigation of the principal theorems contained in this Paper ; but whether that learned mathematician has farther pursued the method, in that or in any other work, I have not as yet been able to ascertain. I have purposely considered some of the series summed by Mr. LANDEN, to afford an opportunity of comparing both theresults and methods; and because the series may have parti.s U 2 i48 Mr, GoMPERTZ on Series which may be summed ocular cases in which both Mr. LANDEN'S means and my own fail: I have added towards the end a general scholium concerning the cause, circumstances, and consequences of such failure in my method. The foundation of the theorems depends on the following Well known lemmas. No. I. 2 sine of vz. sine of tz, is equal to cos. of t v e z Cos. of t + v . Z. No. II. e sine of vz . cos. of tz, is equal to sineof t + v. z sine oft v . z, or sine of t + v . z + sine of v-t z. No. III. 2 Cos. of vz. Cos. of tz, is equal to cos. of t-V .z + cos. oft + v . z.

It is evident from Cor. ii. and ui. Tleorein I. that if the coefficients of the sines (a, b, c, &c.) or of the cosines (a, a', bP, ct, &c. ) be such that any order of differences taken according to the common method becomes =0o, we shall then have the corresponding value, of the successive values of s, s', -s, &c. expressed 'in finite terms, and we shall consequently get the value of the series sought expressed in finite terms, and likewise all the intermediate values of s', s", s , &c. contained between s and the said corresponding successive value of s, expressed in finite terms; hence if the values of a, b, c, &c. or of a, a', b', c', &c. be respectively equal r r r+b r. r+b. r+2b i togg t. * &c. r, z, t, being all affirmative values, and r-t a multiple of h, we may obtain the stum of the series. In order to prove this, I shall put r, r, r, &c. to represent r+h, r+2h, r+3J, &c. t, t, t, &c. for t+h, t+2h, t+3h, &c. -I t 3 rrr r rr ...... r then will the increment of +I l tt t ..t a 6+16+7ZE+V r r (v being supposed the only variable quantity) r-r r.r rr. r...r u4I F+ . 1 2 1+Y I r-t--b I v X t b X It Is uIlket t t.i , +...... 1+1 wise evident that the v+ ith term of the series proposed may r rr r.r... r be expressed by t. g, (v being a whole positive 1 23 number,) this term we will call T, therefore we have, from MDCCcvI.

Hitherto we have been considering a series of sines and cosines, whose terms have all the same signs; but if the terms of a series proposed were alternately positive and negative, it would be necessary to divide them into two series, the one of the positive term and the other of the negaby a Method of DIfferences. 157 tive , in order to get the sum by Theoren I. But the sum of a series whose terms are alternately positive and negative, may be obtained from the sum of a similar series, whose terms are all positive by a mere substitution; thus if the sum of the series, a sine of rz.b sine of r + s. z + c sine of r+2s. Z-&c. were required, put rz--180'-pz, and szz 18o -qz, therefore the sine of rz sine of 18o0-pz=sine of pz, sine of r+s.zsine of 36o0p+q.z=sine ofp+q~z sine of r+2s.

If there be a series, a. sine ofpz-b. sine ofp q . z4.c. sine. of.p+2q e z-d. sine ofp+3q . z &c.-s, then shall a. sine of pz-a'. sine of p'+q.z+b'. sine of p'+2q.z &c.=s' a sine of p"z-a" sine of p? q.z+b" sine of p"Jr2q.z &c.=s" a sine of p"'z-a"' sine of p"' q.z+b sine of pl"+2q.z &c,-=sI# &C. &C'i &Cc &&o. 1,8 Mr. GOMPERTZ On Ser es wlhich may be summed And if the series be, a cos. ofpz-b Cos. of p+q . t+c g 0tof P+2q*. z &C.-s, then shall a cos. of p'z-a' cos. of p'+q z+b' cos. of p'+2q .z &c.=s' a cos. of.p"z-a cos. ofp"+q.z+b" cos. ofp"+2q.z &c. s" &c . &c, &6c. &cc. a, all, a", &c. b', bil, &cc.

Though we have given two theorems, the one for a series whose terms are all positive, and the other for a series whose terms are alternately positive and negative; they are both true whatever the signs of the terms be, provided, that proper signs be used in the operation; that is, if any term should have a contrary sign, to the sign of that term contained in the enunciation of the theorem used, then a con, trary sign must likewise be prefixed to it in the operation; thus, for instance, if for a series whose terms are all positive. we should use Theorem I. or for a series whose terms are alternately positive and negative we should use Theorem I., for a, b, c, d, &c. we must write a, -b, c, -d, &c. and therefore a, a, d, b &c.=a,_a~b, c+b, -d+c, &c.-(suppose) a, -a,, b,-, c,, &c.. as a, " &c.=a.,-a,+a,,+a, c,+b,, &c.= a,, _-a,,, b,,t _c,,7 &c., a, aO bU"., &c.=a,-a.+a, b,+a,,,_c,,+b,,,&c.-&c. &ac &c. &c. &c. &c. &C. &c. &C. &C. &C. Rio Mr. GOMPERTZ On Series which may be summed and consequently we shall get new series, the coefficients, of whose terms are formed from the coefficients in the preceding series, by addition instead of subtraction; and may be of good purpose on some occasions. And if we alternately use these theorems the operation will be performed by alternately taking sums and differences and this will amount to the same as taking the differences of the alternate terms, beginning always with two noughts.: but, for the more readily comprehending this, we shall offer a theorem which moreover is the first of these theorems I discovered, but previously thereto shall propose Example 2.

Now if xve can prove that the same expressions, derived from the comparison of the coefficients of the homologous powers of z, give the sum of the series p' l-r. r/2 r + +r . '-.p+ 2? q &c. n hether r be a whlole positivre nlumber Yt 164 Mr. GOMPERTZ on Series which mci be siontn~ed or not, it will followv that the series, sine of pz-r sine of r+I *ine of p-'qr~z p+q.z+r. -, sine of p+, q.z &c. will be equal to .~~~~~~~~~~~~~Cs ofI and the series, cos. of pz -r cos. of p+q.z+r. r cos. of ~~~~COS. of pq-!~r 2+2q.z &c. c f r whether r be a whole positive ~~~~~2 cos. ot ,nuimber or not.

This being proved, it follows, because the sum of the series pm-r.p+qjm"+r. p+.2qfrn &c. when mn is equal to o, is equal to 1-r+ r. &c.=, by the binomial theorem, ,whatever r may be, that the sum of the seriesp-r.Tq+r. P 4-j2FF &c. namely, the said series when in is equal to i, may be expressed by I x a series of pure powers of r of a finite number of terms whatever r may be, and comes out by the bye X pqr, the same as above, and consequently by writing I, 2, 3, 4i, 5,, &c. one after the other for, ng, we shall find that the sum of the series pi4rppqlll+r. 2q p+qm &c. may always be ex-i pressed by ^1 multiplied by a series of finite terms in the form A+Br+Cri &c. A, B, C, &c. p, q, rn, &c. being indepen dent of r; and mz a whole positive number. And these will, we shall prove without running through all the infinite cases, be the very same expressions as those given above, by comparing the coefficients of the homologous powers of z. In order to this we observe, since we have just proved that the sum of the said series, whatever r may be, may be expressed by L' x series A+-Br+Cr2 &c. of a finite liumber of ternms, and from the comparison of the homologous powers, that when r is a whole number it may be expressed by + x value a+br+ cr2 &c. of a finite number of terms it follows that whenr is any 166 Mr. GOMPERTZ on Series wzhizch may be sumnmed whole number, that these two values must then be equal to each other, and .-. that A+Br2+Crz &c. containing a finite number of terms must be then equal to a+br+cre &c. containing a finite number of terms, and consequently the highest power of r and its coefficient must be the same in both series, otherwise by increasing r by the same in both, one side of the equation would become greater than the other, which is absurd; consequently the highest power of r and its coefficient is. the same in both, and will destroy each other, and consefluently the next highest powers of r and likewise their coefficients must be the same with each other, and will therefore be destroyed, &c. Hence the powers of r and their respective coefficients being the same in both, the expressions themselves must be the same in every respect, whether r be a whole number or not. Hence we have not only given two different means of sum_ning the series pm-r n &C. (m being a whole positive mumber) whatever r may be, which indeed was not our chief object, but we have likewise proved that the series sine of pr-r sine of p+q.z &c.= _ _f P -7, and the series cos. of X cos, of aqz pz-r cos. ofp+q.z &c.= cOS. of p-.?qr.z whatever r may be, the PI-,,-r~~~~~~~ cos. ofqz c= .CSOf Iqz~r same as LANDEN finds.

As the two first theorems depend on the differences of the coefficients of the immediate terms or emitting none, the two last on the differences of the coefficients of the alternate terms or omitting one term; so we may give theorems for the differences of the coefficients of 172 Mrb. oPERTZ OX Seres zv Wch may be summed the terms, omitting 2, g, &c terms; in fact, if r be amwhole number, and the tLrms of the series be all positive, or any how positive and negative by sets, provided the same signs return in the same order after every set, consisting of r number of terms; by continually multiplying by 2 sine of J qz, xwe shall get new series by taking the differences of th coefficients of every term and the rth succeeding term begins fling with r number of noughts; except indeed that the coefficients of the terms will sometimes have the order of signs interrupted, namely, when a greater value is to be subtracted from a less. But if every set should have the same order to signs contrary to those in the set immediately preceding, and consequently every set omitting one set continually, have the same order of signs, then by continually multiplying by 2 Cos. of j-qz, we shall get new series by taking the differences of the coefficients of any term and the rth term from it.

If we have the sum of the series, a sine of pz+b sine of pJ.z+c sine of p+2q. z+d sine of p+Sq.z &c. expressed generally in terms of p5, q, and z, we may find the sum of the series, a cos. of pz+b cos. of p+q.z+ccos. of p+2q.z+d cos. of p+3q .z &c. expressed generally in terms of p, q, and Z, and the contrary. For if we put g9?+pz for pz in the series, and in the expression for its sum, we shall have instead of the sum of the Series, a sine of pz+b sine of p+q.z+c sine of p+2q.z &c., the sumn of the series, a. sine of go0+pz+b. sine of 9go-p +q.z Sc sine of 900+p+2q . z &c. or because the sine of an arc is equal to the sine of 18o?that arc, we shall have the sum of the series a. sine of 90?-pz+b. sine of 90e-p+q.z &c. or its equal, a. cos. of pz+b. cos. of p+q.z+c. cos. of p-+ x2q.z &c, which is the first part of the theorem; and by following the 176 Mr. GOMPERTZ On Series which may b)e -smmed steps backwards, and substituting pz-go' -for pz throughout we get the second part Q. E. D. This theorem evidently supposes that the functional values of pz are distinct in the general expression for the sum of the series, before the substitution takes place, which may not be the case if p has any particular value, or even if p, q, and z have any relation to each other. Theorem VI. Given the sum of the series a sine of 7z+,b sine of '+4sz +c sine of ar + 2x.Z+d sine of w-+3G. z4+ &c. and likewise of a cos. of rz+b cos. of x+x.z+c cos. of x+2cz+ &c. ex-i pressed generally and distinctly in terms of z for any particular values of x and a, except s -oo v and x having the same value in both series; there will likewise be given the sum of the series, a sine of pzrefb sine of p+q.z+c sine of p+2qz &c. and likewise of, a cos. of pz+b cos. of p+q.z+c cos. of p+2q.z &c. generally and distinctly in terms of p, q, and z. For, calling the first series A and the second B, and putting z= q, we have by substitution, a sine of 2x+b.sine of q +q . x+c .sine of + 2q .x+d. sine of +3q. xr &c.=A, and a*cos. of -x+b. cos. of q, + q.x+c. cos. ofX +2q. x+d. cos. of +3q. x+ &c. = B. A and B being now expressed in general terms of q and x, and particular values; multiply the first by, 2 Cos. of p. X by a Methlod of Dferences. 177 and the second by !f sine of p. x by means of lemma No. 11. and we get, a sine of px-a sine of p2-Zi--.x+b sine ofp q.x-b sine ofp-. 2 -q.. x+c sine of p+2q.x-csine ofp_. 2q-2q. x &C. 2A cos. of p-. x, and a sine of px 'C~_ +a sine of p-. . x b sine of p +q.x+b sine ofp_ e +c sine ofp+2q .x+c sine of p_ _2q. x &c.-2B sine of p x consequently, adding these two together, we have by dividing by 2, a sine of px+b sine of p-fq.x+c sine of p+2q. &c.-A cos. of p. x+B sine ofp p -. x, expressed generally and distinctly in terms of p, q, and x, the equation will therefore remain if we put z in the place of x throughout, and therefore the sum of the series, a sine of pz+b sine of p+q.z &c. is given expressed generally in terms p, q, and of z, which is the first part of the theorem. Again, by multiplying the series, a sine of x+b sine of K Zq. x &c.-A, by 2 sine of p-qj x, by means of lemma No, I. and the series, a cos. of X cos. of q.x &c.=3Bby a cos. ofpx by means of lemma No. IIL we shall have a cos. ofp-.-0 x-a cos. ofpx+b Cos. ofp-q. x b cos. of p+q x+ cos. of p O-q *x-c cos. of xf2q x + &C.= 2A cos. of-p-E x, and a cos. ofp_ . xla cos. of pr b os. of q q.x+b cos. of pq.x~c cos. of q.

Q. E. D. Cor. i. It is evident that p and q may be taken any numbers either positive or negative, but X ought not to be equal to o, for we could not then effect the substitution z . Cor. ii. Putting, a cos. of pz+b cos. of p+q.z &c.=P, and a sine of pz+b sine ofp q . z &c.=Q, and also B and A' for the values that B and A become, by writing z for x in those values, that is, z for " in the given expressions B and A we shall have P=B' cos. of p-.

Hence we may again prove, that if we have the sum of the series, a sine of pz+b sine of p+qrzt &c. expressed generally in terms of p, q, and z, we may find the series, a cos. of pz+b. cos. ofp+q.z+ &c. expressed generally in terms of p, q, and z, and the contrary. For having the sum of the first by writing r for p, z for q, we; shall have the sum of the series;, a sine of irz b sine of 7V+ X.Z+ &C. =A, expressed by z, and particular values ; in which writing ai for z, we get A', therefore having A' and Q. we may, by I!.1F by a Method of Diferences. Ii help of Cor. ti. find P in terms of p, 'q, and z, and particular values, namely, the sum of the series a cos. of p+b cos of p+q.z &c. and in a similar manner the contrary is proved. -Q.E. D. Theorem VII. If we have the sum of the series, a sine of pz+b sine of qz+c sine of rz+ &c. expressed generally by z; we have likewise the sum of the series, a cos. of px . sine of py +b cos. of qx. sine of qy+c cos. of rx sine of ry &c. expressed gene-. rally by x and y. And if we have the sum of the series, a cos. of pz+b cos. of qz+c cos. of rz &c. expressed generally by z; we have likewise the sum of the series, a cos. of px. cos. of py+b cos. of qx . cos. of qy+c, cos. of rx . cos. of ry &c.; and also the sum of the series, a sine of px . sine of py +b sine of qx. sine of qy+c sine of rx sine of ry &c. expressed generally in terms of x and y. First ; if we have the sum of the series a sine of pz+b sine of qz &c. expressed in terms of z, by writing x+y in the room of z throughout, we shall have the sum of the series, a sine of p.x+y+b sine of q.x yec sine of r.x+y &c. expressed in terms of x and y and in like manner by writing x-y for z we shall have the sum of the series, a sine of p.x-y+b sine of q . x-y+c sine of r.x-y &c. expressed in terms of x and y, therefore the half difference of these two, tha is, a. sine ofp.x+ysine of p.x-y + sine of q xysine of q.x-y that is, a. _ +^ _ 2 2 sine of Jmysine of ra-Y &c. or its equal by lemma No, 1i, a cos. of poX sine of py+b cos. of qx . sine of qy4c cos. of rx.

Q.E.D. Corollary. From the sum of the series, asine of pz + b sine of qz + &c. having obtained the sum of the series, a cos. of of px. sine of py + b cos. of qx. sine of qy &c. if a' be put for a cos. of px, b' for b cos. of qx, c' for c cos. of rx, &c. this series will be reduced to a' sine of py + b' sineof qy + co sine of ry &c. which is of the first form of this theorem, and consequently from it may be deduced the sum of the series a' cos. of pzv. sine of pv + bcos. of qw. sine of qv + C cos. of rw. sine of am &c. and therefore its equal the sum of the series a Cos. of pw. cos. of px . sine of pv 4 b cos. of qw . cos. of qx. sine of qv + c cos. of rw. .<cos. of rx. sine of rv + &c. in terms of v) w, and x, but if a' had been put for a sine of py, b' for by a Metliod of Dffferences. b sine of qy &C.; we should have ha d the series reduced to the form a' cos. of py + b' cos. of qy &C. which is of'the <d form of thle thleorem, and consequently from it is deduced tflnc sum of each of the series, 1st. a' cos. ofpw. cos. of pv + 1/ cods. of qqw . cos. of qv &c. that is, of the series a cos. of pw . co's ofpv. sine of px + b cos. of qw . cos. of qfv h sine of qx &c. in terms of v, w, and x, which is indeed similar in form to the series found by the other substitution; and 2d. the sum of the series a' sine of pw sine of pv + 6' sine of qw sine of qv &c. or its equal the sum of the series a sine of pzu. sine of px. sine of pv + b sine of qz. sine of qx.. sine of qv + &c. in termns of v, w, andd x. And in a similar manner, from the sum of the series a cos. of pz + b cos. of qz &c. having found the sum of the seriesa cos. of px. cos. of py + b cos. of qx . cos. of qy &c. we may find the sum of the series a cos. of pw . cos. of pv . cos. ofpx + b Cos.. of qw'. cos. of qv .

And in a similar manner also may we proceed by degrees to more complicated cases, Example 1. Because (from Example 1. Scholium 2. after Example 3.

(respectively) Example 2. Theorem IIL for the simple sines and cosines. General Scholium. It is necessary to obeserve, that there may be particular cases, in the summation of which these mahod3 fail, and which, if not properly considered, may lead to great error, especially when new series are derived from those containing failing cases, by multiplying by fluxions, and finding the fluents of the expressions thence arising. For if the correction should happen to be sought from any of the failing cases, the summation of the new series might not only fail in the failing case of the primary expression, but in every other. From Example i. Theorem I. we have sine of fiz + sine of _p + q z + sine of p + 2q. z &C. _= C this when z = o, will be sine of o + sine of o + sine of o &c. or o + o + 0 &C. = 2sLof; that is the sum of a series of noughts infinite, which is absurd. Again, in Example 2. Theorem I. Cor. i. cos. of nz + cos. of 3nfz + cos. of .,-# &c. = therefore if z be taken o it will be i * 1 + X &c. o which ought to be infinite, and in C(or. It. t being = owe have i + i + X + I-&c. I. Inl order to explain the reason of these absurdities, and to prevent the errors they may produce, it is necessary to con, 184 Mr. ( GOMPERTZ on Series which may be summed sider the subject more minutely, to which purpose Scholium if. at the end of Theorem IV. will afford great assistance: from that it appears, that the sum of the r first terms of the series COS. of nz + cos. of n + q .z + cos. of n + 9q . z &c. sine of ntqsn of n-qz inc of n---qIz sine ofn z ; and by similar means that the 2 Szlfe ? jqz sum of the r first terms of the series sine of nz+ sine of v V _COSe3F ntr.qzcos. of 1 n-Aq n+q.z sine of n+2qz+ &C.-= 2 sine ot n z+ f z now it is plain that if qz were either equal to o or a multiple of 36o0, sine of #-qz would be equal to a, and because r is a whole number, rqz would either be equal to o or a multiple of 3600, and consequently the sine of n?r-. q z= sine of n-jIq.z and the cosine of nY+r--q.z= cos. of n-j.q.z, and therefore the sum of the series, cos. of nzcos. of n+q.z &c. =(when qz3o or some multiple of 360o) sine of n_ I q-z_ -sine of no Tq z o = -O and of sine of nz+ sine of n+q.z &c..=? whatever r may, whether finite or infinite, Indeed the determining the value of a, depends on the value of r; but if qz be any thing but o or a multiple of 360, the value of the sine or cosilne of n +r-1q.z will depend on the value of r, and may then be varied from positive to negative and from negative to positive, by merely increasing r, and consequently when r is infinite, there being no reason for its being positive rather than negative, or negative rather than positive it should be considered o; and therefore the sum of the infinite series, Cos. of nzcos. of n+qq.z &c.=sine of n-q, zi z l and of sine of nz + sine of n + q . z &c. W -bya Method of De?ffrences : tzSiof tf-lq.Z in every case, (the same as in Example to Theorem I. ) except when qz-o or some multiple of 3-oo; on account of there being something else to be taken into consideration, in that case. Again, it appears by Example 2 of the said scholium, that the sum of the r first terms of the series, cos. of nz-cos. of n +q.zz cos. of n+2q.z -&c.= COS. of n -q.z* Cos. of JrI.q cos-ofnHi...~q~z~cos~ofn~r~.qz the tipper or under -sine to be z COS. of 1qz taken according as r is odd or even. And by similar means the sum of the r first terms of the series, -sine of nz-sine of n+q z z+ sine of :n+j7. zsine of n+3q. z &c. is found sine of n-.Iq.z+ sine of n+r-2. the u t 2 -5 ~~~~~~~the upper sign i be taken if ri 2 o. f z sig odd but the under if even. Here if qzi8o0, or any odd multiple thereof, the cosine of jqz will be = o; and if r be __ even at the same time the cos. of n+r.q.z will be equal to the cosine of n-.q.z and the sine of +r-.q.z sine of n --qz; but if r be odd we shall have the cos. of n+r-r.q.z = cos. of n-zjq.z and sine of n+r-L.q.z= the sine .z . . ths vausi h of r-2,%z; consequently by substituting these values in the above expressions for the sum, due regard being had to the signs, we shall find that, whatever r be, the sum of either series will be expressed by 2: but if z be any other value it appears that + the sine or cosine of n+r-j.q.z depends on the value of r, and may be either positive or negative, by varying r; and consequently should as above when r is infinite be considered = o. And the sumof the series, sine of aM-NDCCev B b i86 MVr.

And thus may we proceed in other expressions when the sum of r terms can be obtained by a general value. That these things should happen as above described is likewise evident, from the investigations of the theorems; for in Theorem I. for instance, we have sw = +2 sine of -aqtz' or + S . 2 sine of --qzl, 7r being a positive whole number; therefore if the sine of Iqz be = a, which will happen when qzo or some multiple of 36o0, it is plain that we should have by a Method of Diferences. 187 s'=x -sxo, or ? sxo, and consequently sr ought likewise to come, out equal to o, and therefore s, would be -= 2; and consequently when sv in that case does not come out = o, it is certain that there must have been something neglected: and to shew how this may happen, we observe that since Theorem I. and II require the differences of the coefficients of every term and the next succeeding term to be taken, it 'IS evident that the last term will have nothing to be taken from, and will consequently remain through every new series; in consequence of which there will be terms of the form A sine or cosine of mrqr.z, (in which r is a whole number and infinite, the number of terms of the series being infinite,) whose coefficient A will never be = o unless the series a, b, c, &c. be converging: these terms are unavoidably omitted, by reason of their place being at an infinite distance, and can consequently never be arrived at; but still unless it be equal to o, it should not be omitted; which it cannot be unless, either in the above mentioned circumstance of the series a, b, c, &c. being converging or when the terms of the series of sines or cosines, are continually changing their signs, for different values of r; which it will always do when qz is not equal to o or some multiple of 3Go?; provided the coefficients a, b, c, &c. are all affirmative: and consequently the said terms may be omitted in every such case, there being no reason for taking one sign rather than the other: but if qz were equal to o or some multiple of 36o, since A . sine or cosine of -a+qr.z will then be simply A. sine or cos. of pz, and there, fore if the same sign whatever r may be, when a, b, c, d, &c. ---to A, have all the same signs; and consequently cannot 12 b 188 Mr. GOMPERTZ On Series which may be summed be then neglected unless in the case above mentioned of a, b, C, &c. being converging, in which circumstance; it will have no failing case: but had the coefficients a, b, c, d, -&c. been alternately + and ., the failing case would not happen when qz-o or a multiple of 36oQ, for then there being no reason for taking A of one sign rather than the other, it should therefore be taking equal to o; but it wil happen when sine or cOs. of z+qr.z is alternately positive and negative, by continually increasing r by 1: for then the coefficients of the terms of the form, sine or cos. of w-+qr.z being alternately positive and negative and likewise the terms themselves alternately positive and negative, the whole values resulting from them will have the same determinate sign, and this will be when qzo-180or some multiple thereof. And if a, b, c, d, &c. be positive and negative according to some other law, the failing cases may be found by the like reasoning; which is likewise applicable to the other theorems. These remarks pave the way to the correction of fluents necessary in the application' of the doctrine of fluxions to these series'. 1.

Multiply this again by z, and find the fluent, and we by a Method of Lfferences. sine of 2z sine of 3Ze Q& =3 have sine of z + -&C.2 and this requires no correction whilst z is from o to 360 inclusively of both; this is evident at first sight, as we are not now obliged as before to avoid correcting when z-o or 3600, as the equation from which this is derived doesl not fail in; those cases. 2.

If the correction had been sought when z=i8o0 we should have it -1+ -3-5 &c. Q answering whilst z is from go9 to 2700. s. Again, from Cor. i. E-xample 2. Theorem I. cos. of z + cos. of 8z+ cos. of az+ &c. is equal to o, failing (from, above) when qz = o or a multiple of 3600, and therefore when z = o or a multiple of 180?: if we multiply by the z and take the fluent we have sine of z + sine of 3Z + sine of jz & 3 5 tion, which should not -be sought when zo or any multiple of 18o, when z = go' it becomes sine of go9 + Of 3 900 + sineof 5X9?3 sine of5 &C90 that is I +&C-, or its eulfor the + 5 3c..~ + 2~ qa~ 19'2 Mr. GOMPEIRTZ on Series which may be summed correction, the same as LANDEN finds, this is true whilst z is exclusively between o and i800, 4. In Cor. i. Example 1. Theorem I. p being i we have sine of z + sine of 3z + sine of 5Z &c. = failing 2 sine of z (from above) when qz or 2Z o, or a multiple of 36o0, and therefore when z = o, or a multiple of 180o; if we multiply this by Z and find the fluent we have, because (by 2 s1ine of z puttinggyforthesineofZ)Z = (x being put for I ) whose fluent is = .L log, of x + V/11, j log. of ' consequently cos. of z+ co' f *+ y 3 COs. of S2: t + ^/I$ 5f~ -2 log. of L?_+ correction, which being sought when z=9o' and consequentlyy-=i and the cosines of z, of 3z, of 5z, &c. = O, we have it equal to o ; and this has no failing case since it will not fail when z = o or any multiple of 180o in which primitive equation does.

Ifp be = q 1 we shall have, sine of z g sine of 2Z sine of z: . sine of 3Z &c. = sin of if we now multiply by z 91+i-zg Cos. of Z' calling the cosine of z, x and find the fluent, we shall have ocos. of2z 'A+,c COs.

According to this General Scholium, Example 2. to Theorem IL. has failing cases in the investigation, unless the series 1, r, r. !42. &c. converge; thus those in the Corollaries i. ii. and iii. when qz is anyodd multiple of 1800. By bringing both series to one side in the equations in Cor. ii. we have sine of qr-p .z+ sine ofpz-rxsine ofq.r-j -_p.z+ sine ofp q.z + &c. = o, and cos.of qr-pp. z cos. of pz-r x cos. of q.r+ -p .z os. ofp + q. z + &c. o.

We may farther add, that when series are obtained from others having failing cases by substitution, as in Scholium nii. to Theorem I. or as in Theorem V. and VI. regard should be had to those failing cases, according to the manner of substitution, in order to find the, failing cases -in the new series. We might proceed to many more examples, in finding tlhe sums of new series from others multiplied by fluxions, or we might give examples of finding the sums of new series by throwing others into fluxions: but my chief object in these latter examples was to obviate any difficulty that might appear in choosing the cases for the correction of the fluents. There are other inferences to be drawn) which I may perhaps consider at some future period.
