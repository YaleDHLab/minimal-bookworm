[ 549 1 XXIII, On the Rolling Motion of a GCylinder. By the Rev. HENRY MOSELEY, M.A., F.R.S, Corresponding Member of the Institute of France. Received March 6,-Read March 13, 1851. THE oscillatory motion of a heterogeneous cylinder rolling on a horizontal plane has been investigated by ETJLER*, He has determined the pressure of the cylinder on the plane at any period of the oscillation, and the time of completing an oscillation when the arcs of oscillation are small. The forms under which the cylinder enters into the composition of machinery are so various and its uses so important, that I have thought it desirable to extend this inquiry, and in the following paper I have sought to include in the discussion the case of the continuous rolling of the cylinder, and to determine1st. The time occupied by a heterogeneous cylinder in rolling continuously through any given space. 2ndly. The time occupied in its oscillation through any given are. 3rdly. Its pressure, when thus rolling continuously, on the horizontal plane on which it rolls. Under the second and third heads this discussion has a practical application to the theory of the pendulum; determining the time occupied in the oscillations of a pene dulum through any given arc, whether it rests on a cylindrical axis or on knifes edges, and the circumstances under which it will jump or slip on its bearings; and under the first and third, to the stability and the lateral oscillations of locomotive engines in rapid motion, whose driving-wheels are, by reason of their cranked axles, untruly balanced.

Assume a =AC, h=CG, O=ACM. W=weight of cylinder. Wk2= momentum of inertia of the cylinder about an axis passing through G and parallel to the axis of the cylinder. w=given value of the angular velocity (d) when 0 has the given value 0,. 0l=given value of 0 when the angular velocity has the given value x. I=given value of GM cotrresponding to the value 0, of d. Then W(k2+GM2)=W(k2+a2+h2-2ah cos 0)=moment of inertia about M. Since moreover the cylinder may be considered to be in the act of revolving about the point M by which it is in contact with the plane, one-half of its vis viva is represented by the formula I1W (doN2 -1(k2+a2 2ah cos d+h 2) ( and one-half of the vis viva acquired by it in rolling through the angle 0,-O, by gL Ik dtJ k2 {(k2+a2-2ah cos d-+h2) (d)(k 2+12)W} But the vertical descent of the centre of gravity while the cylinder is passing fromn the one position into the other, is represented by h(cos 0cos 0,).

If Y be negative in any position of the body, the axis will obviously jump fiom its bearings, unless it be retained by some mechanical expedient not taken account of in this calculation.

If a jump take place at all, therefore, it will take place when Y is a minimurn; and whether it will take place or not, is determined by finding whether the minimum value of Y is negative. If therefore the expression (42.) or (43.) be negative, the axis will jump in the corresponding case. An axis of infinitely small diameter, such as we have here supposed, becomes a fixed axis; and the pressure upon a fixed axis, supposed to turn in cylindrical bearings without friction, is the samne whatever may be its diameter; equations (40.) and (41.) determine therefore that pressure, and equation (42.) or (43.) determines the vertical strain upon the collar when the tendency of the axis to jump from its bearings is the greatest.

The jump of the falsely-balanced Carriage-wheel. The theory of the falsely-balanced carriage-wheel differs from that of the rolling cylinder,-lst, in that the inertia of the carriage applied at its axle influences the acceleration produced by the weight of the wheel, as its centre of gravity descends or ascends in rolling; and 2ndly, in that the wheel is retained in contact with the plane by the weight of the carriage. The first cause may be neglected, because the displacement of the centre of gravity is always in the carriage-wheel very small, and because the angular velocity is, compared with it, very great. If W1 represent that portion of the weight of the carriage which must be overcome in order that the wheel may jump (which weight is supposed to be borne by the plane), and if Y1 be taken to represent the pressure upon the plane, then (equation 52.)

(58.) h > g( e 5e The Driving-Wheel of a Locomotive Engine. The attention of engineers was some years since directed to the effects which might result from the false balancing of a wheel by accidents on railways, which appeared to be occasioned by a tendency to jump in the driving-wheels of the engines. The cranked axle, in all cases destroys the balance of the driving-wheel unless a counterpoise be applied; at that time there was no counterpoise, and the axle was so cranked as to displace the centre of gravity more than it does now. Mr. GEORGE HEATON, of Birmingham, appears to have been principally instrumental in causing the danger of this false balancing of the driving-wheels to be understood. By means of an ingenious apparatus*, which enabled him to roll a falsely-balanced wheel round the circumference of a table with any given velocity, and to make any required displacement of the centre of gravity, he showed the tendency to jump, produced even by a very small displacement, to be so great, as to leave no doubt on the minds of practical men as to the danger of such displacement in the case of locomotive engines, and a counterbalance is now, I believe, always applied. To determine what is the degree of accuracy required in such a counterpoise, I have calculated from the preceding formnule that displacement of the centre of gravity of a driving-wheel of a locomotive engine, which is necessary to cause it to jump at the high velocities not unfrequently attained at some parts of the journey of an express train ; from such information as I have been able to obtain as to the dimensions of such wheels, and their weights, and those of the engines+. The weight of a pair of driving-wLheels, six feet in diameter, with a cranked axle, varies, am told from 2to 3 tons; and that of an engine on the London and Birmingham Railway, when filled with water, from 20 to 25 tons. If n represent the number of miles per hour at which the engine is travelling, it may be shown by a simple calculation, that the angular velocity, in feet, of a six-feet wheel is represented by 2 2n1 or by -n very nearly. In this case we have, therefore,-since W represents the * This apparatus is exhibited by Professor CowPER in his lectures on machinery at King's College. It has also been placed by Col. MoRIN among the apparatus of the Conservatoir des Arts et Metiers at Paris t I have not included in this calculation the inertia of the crank rods, of the slide gearing, or of the piston and piston rods. The effect of these is to increase the tendency to jump produced by the displacement of the centre of gravity of the wheel; and the like effect is due to the thrust upon the piston rod. The discussion of these Subjects does not belong to my present paper.

These conclusions are opposed to the use of light engines and small driving-wheels; and they show the necessity of a careful attention to the true balancing of the wheels of the carriages as well as the drivingwheels of the engine. It does not follow that every jump of the wheel would be high enough to lift the edge of the flange off the rail; the determination of the height of the jump involves an independent investigation. Every jump nevertheless creates an oscillation of the springs, which oscillation will not of necessity be completed when the jump returns; but as the jumps are made alternately on opposite sides of the engine, it is probable that they may, and that after a time they will, so synchronize with the times of the oscillations, as that the amplitude of each oscillation shall be increased by every jump, and a rocking motion be communicated to the engine attended with danger. Whilst every jump does not necessarily cause the wheel to run off the rail, it nevertheless causes it to slip upon it, for before the wheel jumps it is clear that it must have ceased to have any hold upon the rail or any friction. The Slip of the Wheel. Iff be taken to represent the coefficient of friction between the surface of the wheel and that of the rail, the actual friction in any position of the wheel will be represented by Ylf. But the friction which it is necessary the rail should supply, in order that the rolling of the wheel may be maintained, is X. It is a condition therefore necessary to the wheel not slipping that X Yf>X, orf> y(60.) If, therefore, takling the maximum value of in any revolution, we find that f exceeds it, it is certain that the wheel cannot have slipped in that revolution; whilst if, on the other hand, f falls short of it, it must have slipped *. The positions between which the slipping will take place continually, are determined by solving, in respect to Cos 0, the equation f * X . . v . . . . (61.) The application of these principles to the slip of the carriage-wheel is rendered less difficult, by the fact, that the value of h is always in that case so small, as compared with the values of k and a, that a may be neglected in formulae (34.) and (35.), as compared with unity. Those equations then become Wh sinS 0 h2(g +awl)l Wia l (y + a2) (62.) * Of course, the slipping in the case of the driving-wheels of a locomotive, is diminished by the fact that whilst one wheel is not biting upon the rail the other is THE SLIP OF THE DRIVING-WHEEL OF A LOCOMOTIVE ENGINE. 565 and WA (a (_ _ a__) Cos 01 hA cos1 Y fa Cosi + -Wt1+ whence we obtain ~ A--. . .. . ..

When the conditions of slipping obtain, one of the wheels always biting when the other is slipping and the slips of the two wheels alternating, it is evident that the engine will be impelled forwards, at certain periods of each revolution, by one wheel only, and at others, by the other wheel only; and that this is true irrespective of the action of the two pistons on the crank, and would be true if the steam were thrown off. Such alternate propulsions on the two sides of the train cannot but communicate alternate oscillations to the buffer-springs, the intervals between which will not be the same as those between the propulsions; but they may so synchronize with a series of propulsions as that the amplitude of each oscillation may be increased by them until the train attains that fish-tail motion with which railway travellers are familiar. It is obvious that the results shown here to follow from a displacement of the centres of gravity of the driving-wheels, cannot fail also to be produced by the alternate action of the connecting rods at the most favourable driving points of the crank and at the dead points*, and that the operation of these two causes may tend to neutralize or may exaggerate one onother. It is not the object of this paper to discuss the quest tion under this point of view. * A slip of the wheel may thus be, and probably is, produced at each revolution. JWaJndfsworth, Feb. 28, 1851.
