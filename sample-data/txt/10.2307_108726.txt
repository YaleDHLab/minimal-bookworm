[ 45 1 III. On the Equation for the Product of the -Differences of all but one of the Boots of a given Equation. By ARTHUR CAYLEY, Esq.,) FB.AS. Received November 30, 1860,-Read January 10, 1861. IT is easy to see that for an equation of the order n, the product of the differences of all but one of the roots will be determined by an equation of the order n, the coefficients of which are alternately rational functions of the coefficients of the original equation, and rational functions multiplied by the square root of the discriminant. In fact, if the equation be pv=(a, .. .)Cv, 1)n=a(V-oz)(v-f_).. ., then putting for the moment a=i, and disregarding numerical factors, VEJ, the square root of the discriminant, is equal to the product of the differences of the roots, and p'& is equal to (as-I3)Qa-y)..., consequently the product of the differences of the roots, all but a, is equal to / O *. BPo, and the expression , is the root of an equation of the order n, the coefficients of which are rational functions of the coefficients of the original equation. I propose in the present memoir to determine the equation in question for equations of the orders three, four, and five: the process employed is similar to that in my memoir " On the Equation of Differences for an Equation of any Order, and in particular for Equations of the Orders Two, Three, Four, and Five*," viz. the last coefficient of the given equation is put equal to zero, so that the given equation breaks up into v=0 and into an equation of the order n-1 called the reduced equation; and this being so, the required equation breaks up into an equation of the order n-I (which however is not, as for the equation of differences, that which corresponds to the reduced equation) and into a linear equation; the equation of the order n-1 is calculated by the method of symmetric functions; and combining it with the linear equation, which is known, we have the required equation, except as regards the terms involving the last coefficient, which terms are found by the consideration that the coefficients of the required equation are seminvariants. The solution leads immediately to that of a more general question; for if the product of the differences of all the roots except ts, of the given equation pV=(*-(V, 1)n=a(V-c)(v-f3)... =0 (which product is a function of the degree n 2 in regard to each of the roots I3, r) b is multiplied by (x_y)n-2, the function so obtained will be the root of an equation of the order n, the coefficients of which are covariants of the quantic (*ICx, y)f, and these coefficients can be at once obtained by writing, in the place of the seminvariants of the former result, the covariants to which they respectively belong. In the case of the* Philosophical Transactions, vol. cl. p. 112 (1860).MDCCCLXI. H 46 MR. A. CAYLEY ON THE EQUATION FOR A FUNCTION quintic equation, one of these covariants is, in regard to the coefficients, of the degree 6, which exceeds the limit of the tabulated covariants, the covariant in question has therefore to be now first calculated. The covariant equations for the cubic and the quartic might be deduced from the formulae Nos. 119 and 142 of my Fifth memoir on Quantics*; they are in fact the bases of the methods which are there given for the solution of the cubic and the quartic equations respectively; and it was in this way that I was led to consider the problem which is here treated of. 1. The notation 4 (ce, j ..) is used (after Professor SYLVESTER) to denote the product of the squared differences of (o, (, y. .), and the notation 41( ,, y..) to denote the product of the differences taken in a determinate order, viz. 2. The product of the differences of the roots of an equation depends, as already noticed, on the square root of the discriminant; and in order to fix the numerical factors and signs, it will be convenient, in regard to the equations (a, b, clv, 1)2=0, (a) b, ea djv, 1)3 0, (a, b, el d, eD~v,) ])= I (a) b9 e7 d, e, f~c9 1)5=0 to write as follows:t; (of 13)= a>V-(4ac_ -2) 0-1 j a~~~~~ equatin j3 V0) (2 rc)3 = -[3,7r'),if for [3,)r= ) we ub a a~~~ v4x Pl? r/3 P )AV/256az3e3-27a'24 --8W t~aGC 0ya8 )_ = . a4N/0`25ay494+256a36 . .--4 V n where it is to be observed, for example, that weriting in the last equation ?-0, and therefore f= 0, we have V-(CG 3,y , 0)=-a4V256e3., which agrees with the equation~~ ~~~ e(a Aa V?=~Y3(:i y )a(,, Ad 6), if for -(v, , y, l we sub, stitute the value given by the last equation but one.

OF THE DIFFERENCES OF THE ROOTS OF A GIVEN EQUATION. 47 To apply the method above explained, write y=O, and therefore also d=O; the roots thus become and we have the quadric and linear equations (0+c?)X0-3)=0, 0(cs-j3)=9, where (a, (3) are the roots of the equation (a, b6, cv,, 1)2= 0. Hence, writing Z=4ac-62, we have 11 and the two equations become ?Pa+dV-Z-c=0, 0a-V-Z=O; or multiplying the two equations together, 03a2+020 +(3ac b2)+cV/= 0, which is what the required equation becomes, on putting therein d=O; the coefficients of the complete equation are seminvariants, and the terms in d are to be inserted by means of this property. The coefficient 3ac-b2 is reduced to zero by the operator 3aab+2b6c+C'd, it is therefore a seminvariant, and remains unaltered. The coefficient CV/-Z is what VEl becomes (EO being the discriminant of the cubic equation) on putting therein d=0, it is therefore to be changed into A0. Hence 4. For the cubic equation (a, b6 c, dXv, 1)V the equation for 0(=d4(o, X3)) is 0= ( O + a 0 Xi ,T3 For the quartic equation (a, 6, G. 4, e~v, 1)4= 0;5. Here 0= -2(~, 13, y)= -( 3)(ez -) the roots are 0, = G (Y. y, ) 03= V(05 f1), 4= -2(75 13,y), the signs being in this case (and indeed for an equation of any even order) alternately positive and negative; in fact, if the equation is represented by pv=O, then the roots divided by 4ffox, 13 y, A) should respectively be Ip'm, @'p1, p'r, p and this will be the case if the signs are taken as above. H2 48 MR. A. CAYLEY ON THE EQUATION FOR A FUNCTION 6. Putting now o=0 (and therefore e=0) the roots become d8=C/,(M-PO, O -i4rG3-r) where (cG, j3, r) are the roots of (a, b, c, dXv, 1)3=0. Let Z denote the discriminant of the cubic function, then V(cj, r)=8V-Z, and we have thus the linear equation; the cubic equation is II3{0 '1r(13-r)} =0, the coefficients of which can be calculated by the method of symmetric functions (see Annex No. 1). 7. The cubic equation being thus obtained, we have the two equations 03. a4 0a2 +O2*_a2VZ +V-Z +0 .-9a2d2'+4abcd-b'd '+' d2Vz =0 =0; and multiplying these together, the resultant equation is 04 a6 + 0'.0 + 02. a2( 9a2d2 +4abcd-b3d+Z) +0.

The coefficient -8a2d+4abc-6' is a seminvariant, and requires no alteration. The coefficient 9a2d2+ 4abedb3d+Z is 9a2d2+ 4abed b'd + 27a2d2l 8abod + 4ac3 + 4Udb2e2; that is, +18a2d2 -1 4abed + 4ac3 + 3b'd 162c', OF THE DIFFERENCES OF TIE ROOTS OF A GIVEN EQUATION. 49 and the terms in e to be added to this, in order to make it a seminvariant, are easily found to be -16a2e + 6ab2e 8.

As a verification of this result, I remark that, taking for the quintic equation v +v4+v3+v2+v+1=0, the roots of this equation are -1, WI W, 2 , 2I where w is an imaginary cube root of unity (ci2+ci+1_O). We ought to have ( f, a, , e) = = 36; and this will be the case if, for instance, aZ, y3 r, s are respectively -1, I W27 W2, _C,.

CAYLEY ON THE EQUATION FOR A FUNCTION The equation in 0 is thus (d 6)2(d+12)(d2+108)=0, or multiplying out it is (1, 0, 0, +432, -11664, +46656;I, 1)4=0, which in fact (observing that ,/o 36) is what the preceding formula becomes for the equation (1, 1, 1, 1, 1, lXv, 1)5=0. The analogous verifications for the cubic and the quartic equations are as follows; 16. For the cubic, if the assumed equation is v3+v2+v+1=0, the roots whereof are -1, I, -.-i (i2= 1), then we should have V(f, r)=v'4i, which will be the case if a, 13, r=-1, i, -i, respectively, and the roots ra r-a, cs-f3 of the equation in 0 then are 2i, -i+1, -i-1, so that the equation in 0 is (02+2id-2)(0-2i)=O, or (1, 0, 2, 4i By, 1)3=0, which (observing that V/J=4i) is what the formula for the equation in d becomes for the equation (1, 1, 1, lv, 1)3=0. 17. For the quartic equation, -taking this to be v4+v3+v2+v+1 =0, the roots are a2, W3a, where w is an imaginary fifth root of unity (W4+WI3+a2+cl+1=0), and putting cI, f3, y, ; equal to WX W2W cW, 4 respectively, we have Vff J(aj PI r A) 5( + a4_ WI _6 3), giving, as it should do, 0 =125. The equation in D is therefore by the formula (l, O. O.-_25w+ 4_Aj2_6P 12510, 1)4= 0. But the roots are 8 = W( 7A)_ (W2_WS)(WI_W4)(W3_W4) 2_ x+ W_ 22 2-X~ --(r t, ) _(OJIW 4 3_W ))=41+3w+2w2+ 3= _-1+Y, C 4 8 ?a, ) (a;4 ) _2) _i)__3w-2 aZ 4 Ye 04-W W2 XW )_(_2(_W3)(W2_W3)= 3+ w_ w2+2W3= 3+X, if, for shortness, X ->*a+2 W3, Y=3x +2 c2+ca3. The equation in d is therefore (0-2 +X)(0+ 1-Y)(0+4+Y)(0-3-X)= 0, where the left-hand side is the product of the factors (d-2+X)(0-3-X)= 02_ 50+6 X x2=d2_5d+10_5(W + '4) and (0+1Y)(0+4+ Y)=02+50+43Y-Y2=2+50+10o5(a2+ W3); and the equation in 0 is, therefore, as it should be, (1, 0, 0, -26w+ 4_W2_ W 125X8, 1)4=0.
