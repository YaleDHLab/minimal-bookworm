[428] LIV. Remarks upon the Heat of the Air in July 1757. in an Extract of a Letter from John Huxham, M. D. F. R. S. to William Watson, M. D. F. R S. dated at Plymouth 19th of that Month. With additional Remarks by Dr. Watson. `` FROM the beginning of June last `` we have had a very dry season, `` generally very warm, and sometimes excessively `` hot. From the 7th to the 14th of this month `` the heat was violent; greater, indeed, than has `` been known here in the memory of man. I `` have talked with several persons, who have lived `` a considerable time in Jamaica, Gibraltar, and `` Minorca; and they severally assert, that they ne`` ver felt such intense heat in any of those places. `` Upon the 11th, 12th, and 13th of this month, `` Fahrenheit's thermometer, in the shade, about `` three o'clock in the afternoon, was at 87; nay, `` upon the 12th it was even above 88. Read Dec. 22, 1757. `` Abundance of people have suffered very severely `` from these excessive heats: putrid, bilious, pe`` techial, nervous fevers, are exceedingly common `` every-where. Dysenteries, haemorrhages, most `` profuse sweats, affect not only those in fevers, but `` a vast many others. The days and nights were `` so intolerably hot, that little or no sleep was to `` be gotten day or night. The wind we had, like `` the Campsin, actually blew hot, tho' strong. `` Upon 3 [429] `` Upon the 15th, about seven at night, at Fal`` mouth, Penryn, Truro, and thereabouts, a pretty `` smart shock of an earthquake was felt, attended `` with a hollow rumbling noise, throwing down `` pewter, china-ware, and such-like. The tinners `` felt it eighty fathom under ground. No great `` damage however was done. The day before we `` had, about eleven o'clock before noon, a most `` violent hurricane, which lasted five or six minutes, `` attended with a heavy shower.'' Thus far Dr. Huxham. The heat of the air at London, during the period above-mentioned, was much greater than has been usually observed in these high latitudes; tho' it was never quite so severe here as at Plymouth. The following table exhibits the degrees of the heat, taken here upon the respective days, about four o'clock in the afternoon, by a Fahrenheit's thermometer. The instrument was placed in the shade; and the accuracy of the observer, who favoured me with his minutes, is not to be questioned. 1757.
