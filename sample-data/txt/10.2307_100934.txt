An Account of the Aponensian Baths near Padua; communicated by the foremention'd Inquisitive Gentleman, Mr. Dodington, in a Letter written to the Publisher from Venice March 18. 1672. SIR, IN the Observations and History of Nature possibly this may not be unvvorthy the notice. Five miles from Padua are th vvaters, call'd Aponensia, from a tovvn called Aponum, famous in antiquity, and among others frequently mention'd by Livy. vvill not doubt, but that Sr. I.F.and D B. two worthy members of the R.Society and who lived long in Padova, have inform'd them selves most exactly of what ever I shall be able to say on this Sub ject; however I do not scruple to give you a short relation of it The waters are actually very hot. Secondly, they are stinking Thirdly, they yield a great deal of very fine salt; of which th natives serve themselves in their ordinary occasions. This salt is the thing, I think most considerable there. It is gather'd in th manner: The Natives, after Sun set, stirr peices of wood in th water, and presently the Salt sticks to them, and comes off in small flakes, exceeding white,and very salt. This never looser its savour. The people there, with the same water use to wash their (4068) their wales,to render them whiter then ordinary; which it doth even whiter than lime. Such wales conserve their saltness some few daies only,and then become insipid, even though they swet forth a white excrescence in thin and light flakes like niter, many years after. But that Salt, which is collected from the stones, gravel and earth, by which the rivolets, descending from those Baths, do run, is withour any tast of Salt; though there be no difference in the form or colour from that which is gather'd with the wooden instruments, by me mentioned. This is the Sum of what I have to say at present of this particular. If you think the matter tanti, I will send you a more ample description thereof, with my thoughts upon it.
