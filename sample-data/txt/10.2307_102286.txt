IV. The Quadrature of a Portion of the Epicycloid. By Mr. Caswel. SUppose D P V to be half of an exterior Epicycloid, V B its Axis, V the Vertex, V L B half of the generant Circle, E its Center; D B the Base, C its Center: Bisect the Arc of the Semicircle V B in L, and on the Center C through L draw a Circle cutting the Epicycloid in P: Then I say the Curvilinear Triangle V L P will be = B E q in C E/C B; that is, the Square of the Semidiameter of the generant Circle will be to the Curvilinear Triangle V L P, as C B the Semidiameter of the Base, to C E: which C E in the exterior Epicycloid is the (114) the Sum of the Semidiameters of the Base and Generant, but in the Interior Epicycloid D p u, 'tis the difference of the said Semidiameters. C O R O L L A R Y. In the Interior Epicycloid, if C E is 1/2 C B, the Epicycloid then degenerating into a right Line, the Quadrature of the Triangle l p u will be in effect the same with the Quadrature of Hippocrates Chius. C O R O L. II. If the Semidiameter of the Base is supposed infinite, the Epicycloid then being the common Cycloid, the Area of the said Triangle will be equal to the Square of the Radius of the Generant, and so it falls in with that Theorem which Lalovera found, and calls Mirabile. Though I do not think the abovesaid Quadrature can easily be deduced from what has been yet published of the Epicycloid, I have not added the Demonstration; but think it enough to name a general Proposition from whence I deduced it, viz. The Segments of the Generant Circle are to the Correspondent Segments of the Epicycloid, as C B to 2 C E + C B. For Example, suppose F m G the Position of part of the Generant when the point F of the Exterior Epicycloid was designed, then the Segment F m G n is to the Segment D F n G:: as C B to 2 C E + C B. And consequently the whole Epicycloid to the whole Generant in the same Proportion: Which is the only case demonstrated by Monsieur De la Hire. It follows also that in the Vulgar Cycloid, its Segments are triple of the Correspondent Sectors of the Generant, which was first shewn by Dr. Wallis. A Demonstration hereof, with a General Proposition for all Curves of this kind, shall be given in the next Transaction. V. A.
