[ 3B7 I XVII. On the .Douhle Tanents of a Cur 9f the Rourth Order. By ARRTAu CAYh EY, ?sq.0 EA.S. Received May 30,-Read June 20, 18S1. TiE present memoir is intended to be supplementary to that " On the Double Tangents of a Plane Curve."* I take the opportunity of correcting an error which I have there fallen into, and which is rather a misleading one, viz. the emanants U1, U2,.. were numerically determined in such manner as to become equal to U on putting (Xi, yi) za) equal to (x, y, z); the numerical determination should have been (and in the latter part of the memoir is assumed to be) such as to render l11, HI, &c. equal to HI, on making the substitution in question; that is, in the place of the formulae U1= -(Xla,+,mba+ z~b,") U2=f(, 1 .DS.x+ylD9+Z:lD2)L, &c., there ought to have been U1= ~ ~~(x_ B (l+ laB la )u, UJ2= (n 2) (an a ) (XI 1 yl~+Y l;r2~a& The points of contact of the double tangents of the curve of the fourth order or quartic U=0, are given as the intersections of the curve with a curve of the fourteenth order II=0;the last-mentioned curve is not absolutely determinate, since instead of 11=0, we may, it is clear, write lI+MU=0, where M is an arbitrary function of the tenth order. I have in the memoir spoken of HiESSE's original form (say ], -0) of the curve of the fourteenth order obtained by him in 1850, and of his transformed form (say 112=0) obtained in 1856. The method in the memoir itself (Mr. SALMON'S method) gives, in the case in question of a quartic curve, a third form, say 113=0. It appears by his paper "; On the Determination of the Points of Contact of Double Tangents to an Algebraic Curve," j that Mr. SALMON has verified by algebraic transformations the equivalence of the last-mentioned form with those of HESSE; but the process is not given. The object of the present memoir is to demonstrate the equivalence in question, viz. that of the equation 113=0 with the one or other of the equations 11=0, rI2=0, in virtue of the equation U=0. The transformation depends, 1st, on a theorem used by HESsE for* Philosophical Transactions, tol. cilixe (1859) pp. 1938212. t Quart. Math. Journ. vol. iii. p. 317 (1859). 358 MR. A. CAYLEY ON TiE DOUBLE TANGENTS the deduction of his second form J,.-0 from the original form IJ,=0, which theorem is given in his paper "; Transformation der Gleichung der Curven l4ten Grades welche eine gegebene Curve 4ten Grades in den Beriihrungspuncten ihrer Doppeltangenten schneiden," Crelle, t. lii. pp. 97-103 (1856), containing the transformation in question; I prove this theorem in a different and (as it appears to me) more simple manner; 2nd, on a theorem relating to a cubic curve proved incidentally in my memoir "; On the Conic of Five-pointic Contact"at any point of a Plane Curve",* the cubic curve being in the present case any first emanant of the given quartic curve: the demonstration occupies only a single paragraph, and it is here reproduced; and I reproduce also HESSE'S demonstration of the equivalence of the two forms ll,=0 and U2-?. Let U (*Xs, y, z)4 be a quartic function of (x, y, z); (a, b, c,f g, 7I) its second differential coefficients; (A, B, C, F, G, H) the reciprocal system (be6_ 2, Cca-g2, ab-h _ gh2-.af, af-, fg -ch). And let H be the Hessian of U, or determinant abc-af q2_g b--ch2+2h (H is of course a sextic function of x, y, z); (a', 6', c',f', g', h') the second differential coefficients ,of 11; (A', 1' C', FI G', I') the reciprocal system (blot-_few2 clax1g2 Iafbf_7112 , 9Whcfl/,flby'g f grCh Then U=0 being the equation of a quartic curve, the equation of the curve of the -fourteenth order which by its intersections determines the points of contact of the double tangents of the quartic curve, may be taken to be (HESSE'S original form) lI=_(A, B, C, F, GI n)-6H, YH, -aH)23H(A, B, C, F.

And moreover, if U, (x= , + l + ola )U and if H, be the Hessian of U, and (a"l, 6", c", f", g", A") the second differential coefficients of H3HM, where in the differentiations (xl y,, z,) are: treated as constants but after the differentiations are effected they are replaced by (x, y, z), and if (A"', B", c", F"!, U", nl") be the reciprocal system (f _f6" ft12, cla"r/2 -g" a6" h"f, g"h"ha1/f?, hf-bo6g" f'g" -.h`) then the equation of the curve of the fourteenth order may be taken to be (SALMON'S form) -3 (Art, B"t, ct F", U"1, 2 L"XGUt9U, aUb) y=0. I have preferred to write the three equations in the foregoing forms; but it is clear that the terms (A, B, C, F, G. HU, x BY, _)2H; (A', B', C', F', U', Beat, -a, 'a)2U might also have been written (A, B, C, F, U, GIHa, I', dt, 2f', 2g', 2h'); (A', V', C', C', G', n'Xa, b, c, 2f, 2g, 2h).* Philosophical Transactions, vol. cxlix. (18.59), see p. 335. t In quoting this formula in my former memoir, the nutnerical factor 3 is by mistake omitted. OF A CURVE OF THE FOURTH ORDER. 359 As already noticed, it has been shown by HESSE (and his demonstration is to be here reproduced) that the two forms11, =0 and '2=-0 are equivalent to each other. And the object of the memoir is to show that the third form 113=0 is equivalent to the other two. The equivalences in question subsist in virtue of the equation U=O, that is, the functions II1, 112, 113 are not identical, but differ from each other by multiples of U. Demonstration of HESSE'S Theorem. Let (a, b, Cef, , hi), (a', 6', c', fg' h') be any systems of coefficients of a ternary quadratic function; (A, B, c, F, GI H), (A', B', C', F', G', H') the reciprocal systems as above, (x, y, z) arbitrary quantities. Consider the function OE=(a, b, c,f, g, h, y, z)2.(Al, B', C', Ft, Gt, Ha, b, c, 2f, 2g, 2h) .-(A', B', Cl, F', G', H'Jax+hy+gz, hx+by+fz, gx+fY+cz)2. The term involving A' is a(a, b, c, f, g, havox, y, Z)2(aX+hy+gz)2, which is =(ab-h2)y2+ (ac-g2)z2+2(afgh)yz = Qy2+B z2_2FYz; and the term involving 2F' is f(a, , c, f, g, h)mx, Z)2-(hx+by+fz)(gx+fy+cz), which is (af-gh)2 + (f2 bc)yz + (fg-ch)zx+(hfbg)xy Fxe-Ayz+Hzx+Gxy; and the entire expression for J is thus A'(C12+B z2-2Fyz) + B'(Az2+Cx2-2Gzx) + C'(Be +Ay2-2Hxy) +2FI' (-Fx2-Ayz+Hzx+Gxy) +2G'(-Gy2Bzx +Fxy +Hyz) +2H'( -Hz2 _(CXy +Gyz+FzZX); or what is the same thing, o =(BC'+B'C-2FF', CA'+C'A-2GG', AB'+A'B-2HH', GH'+G'H-AF' -A'F, HF'+H'FBG'-B'G, FG'+F'GCH'C'H3x, y, Z)2, which is really the fundamental theorem. It is however used as follows; viz. the righthand side being symmetrical in regard to the two systems (a, b, c, f, g, h), (a', b', c', f', g', h'), the left-hand side, which is not in form symmetrical as regards the two -systems, must be so in reality; or if 0 ' is what 0 becomes by interchanging the two systems, then M '= A; MDcccLxI. 3 D 360 MR.

If in particular (a, b, c, f, g, h) are the second differential coefficients of a function u6=(*(x, y, z)P, and (a', b', c', f', g!, h') the second differential coefficients of a function a'=(*(x5, Y, z)P', then the equation becomes p (p -1)U .

C, F, G. Hab, 'Y 'a)2H+(A, B, C, F, G, H3(bvH, bYH, BYH)2 we may eliminate any one of the three terms (A', B', C', F', G', ll')3aU, BYU, aZU)2, H(A5 B. C, F. #S. H EU5 a y3 U5Z) (A, B, C, F, G, II)DaH, aH, zbH)2; and in particular if the second term be eliminated, we obtain the equation 112=5(A, B, C, F, G, Hll),H, YH, O llH)2-3(A', B' C', F, G, Hl'X -U, aU, -aU) 2 and the equivalence of the two forms II,=0 and rl2=0 is thus established. But HESSE'S theorem leads also to the demonstration of the equivalence of the third form 13=0. To use it for this purpose, I remark that if (a", 1/, c", f", g", h") are the second differential coefficients of H HI, where after the differentiations xj, yl, z, are to be replaced by (x, y, z), then the theorem gives 12U.

But on putting (x, N, z) for (Z', yl, zl) we have (since H is a homogeneous function of the order 6, and HI before the change is a homogeneous function of the order 3 in (x, ~y, z)) ac"x+h"y+g"z= 5ZH3.12-9H1=aH-A3aH (since, on making the substiOF A CURVE OF TiE FOURTH ORDER. 361 tution, H-Hj but -xlj-.bxH)=2BxH; and thus (ax J+hty+g"z, / x+b"a 'y+f z, g"x+f'y+c"z) =(2'bH, 2ayH, 2BZH); and similarly, on making the substitution, (a"/, P" c",f", y", hijIx, y, z)2=6 . 5H-3.3.2H,-(30-18)H=12H.

The second line in fact vanishes, which I show as follows: Demonstration of my Theorem for a Cubic Curve. Let U-(*)x, y, Z)3 be a cubic function; it may by a linear transformation of the coordinates be reduced to the canonical form x'+y+z3+G6lxyz, and we then have (A, B, C, F, G, H)a6, B Yz)2H?6 (yz _ 122) . -_6t.I + (zx -12y2). 612y + (Xy-_2z2).2612z. +2(12yz _ lx2).

Or since -1+14 is equal to the quartinvariant S, and the equation is an invariantive one, we have for any cubic function whatever (A, B, C0 F, GI H) by, a_)2H 65=2S. U, which is the theorem in question. There is a difference of notation, and consequently a 362 ON THE DOUBLE TANGENTS OF A CURVE OF THE FOURTH ORDER. different numerical factor in the theorem, as stated in the memoir on the conic of fivepointic contact, referred to above. If, as above, U is a quartic function (*Cx, y, z)4, and U,-1(xIBy, zlb,)U, then U , is a cubic function, and we have (Al, Bj, c, F, G10, H9 , a' )2HI -6'5 2S5. U1, where it is to be noticed that S5 denotes a quartic function in the coefficients of U, and consequently a quartic function in (XI, y, z,), the coefficients being quartic functions of the coefficients of U. On writing (x, y, z) in the place of (xI, y,, z,), SI becomes a quartic function of (x, y, z), which is in fact a quarticovariant quartic of U. If in the foregoing equation we write (x, y, z) in the place of (XII ys Z,), then U, becomes equal to 2U; and consequently, if U=0, the right-hand side of the equation vanishes. Moreover (al b6, cl, fl, g1, h,) (the second differential coefficients of Uj) become equal to (a, b c, f, g, h), and consequently the coefficients (Al, B,, c,, F,, G,, lI) become equal to (A, B, c, F, G, H). Hence, assuming always that U=0, the equation becomes (A, B, C, F, G, HX B, H)2H=0, where after the differentiations (wI, y,, z,) are replaced by (x, y, z). This is the form which is required for the present purpose.
