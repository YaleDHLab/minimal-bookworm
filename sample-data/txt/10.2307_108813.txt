[ 583 ] XXVIII. Dynamical Problems regarding Elastic Spheroidal Shells and Spheroids of Incompressible Liquid. By Professor W. THOMSON, LL.1D., F.I.S. Received August 22,-Read November 27, 1862. 1. THE theory of elastic solids in equilibrium presents the following general problem A solid of any shape being given, and displacements being arbitrarily produced or forces arbitrarily applied over its whole bounding surface, it is required to find the displacement of every point of its substance. The chief object of the present communication is to show the solution of this problem for the case of a shell consisting of isotropic elastic material, and bounded by two concentric spherical surfaces, with the natural restriction that the whole alteration of figure is very small. 2. Let the centre of the spherical surfaces be taken as origin, and let x, y, z be the rectangular coordinates of any particle of the solid, in its undisturbed position, and x+ o, y+g, z+y the coordinates of the same particle when the whole is in equilibrium under the given superficial disturbing action. Then, by the known equations of equilibrium of elastic solids, we have EXd2a d2x\ d (dc do d7\ o Idr2dYc~+dZ21TmI da~X dpmdZ/(d2 yd2 2My\ d ( IIda d3 dy\ _ nX4 d y2+dY27-,r2j+mdz kd+dymdz) '-0 m-n3i and n denoting the two coefficients of elasticity, which may be called respectively the elasticity of volume, and the rigidity. A demonstration of these equations, with definitions of the coefficients, will be found in ? 71 of an Appendix to the present communication. 3. For brevity let d+ d.y.(2) Wdx dy+ dz' so that b shall denote the cubic dilatation at the point (x, y, z) of the solid. Also, for d2 II2 II2 brevity, let the operation i + + de be denoted by v2. Then the preceding equations become nV2 +m =0, }. flV2y +msdZ=?' j 4E2 584 PROFESSOR W. THOMSON ON DYNAMICAL PROBLEMS REGARDING 4. In certain cases, especially the ideal one of an incompressible elastic solid, the following notation is more convenient: p the mean normal pressure per unit of area on all sides of any small portion of the solid, round the point x, y, z. Then (below, ? 21) .P= (mn 34)d$dydz;* * * . . (4) and the equations of equilibrium become n2_m dp mInd 'x dp nV20-, ml, =0 (5) ,2 y _ m dp_0. 5. If the solid were incompressible, we should have m=oo and da + + e= which must be taken instead of (4), and, along with (5), would constitute the four differential equations required for the four unknown functions a, 3, r, P d d 6. To solve the general equations (3) or (5), take d of the first, of the second, d and of the third; and add. We have thus (n+M)V2 =O. (6) or, which is in general sufficient, V2 .O. .(7) If, now, an appropriate solution of this equation for z is found, the three equations (3) may be solved by known methods, the first of them for a, the second for f3, and the third for y,-the arbitrary part of the solution in each case being merely a solution of the equation V2u= 0. These arbitrary parts must be determined so as to fulfil equation (2) and the prescribed surface conditions. The complete particular determination of b cannot, however, in most cases be effected without regard to a, A, y; and the order of procedure which has been indicated is only convenient for determining the proper forms for general solutions of the equations. 7. First, then, to solve the equation in 6 generally, we may use a theorem belonging to the foundation of LAPLAcE'S remarkable analysis of the attraction of spheroids, which may be enunciated as follows. If the equation V23-=O is satisfied for every point between two concentric spheres of* See Professor STOKES'S paper "4 On the Friction of Fluids in Motion, and the Equilibrium and Motion of Elastic Solids," Cambridge Philosophical Society's Transactions, April, 1845. ELASTIC SPHEROIDAL SHELLS AND SPilEROIDS OF INCOMPRESSIBLE LIQUID. 585 radii a (greater) and a' (less), the value of z for any point of this space, at distance r from the centre, may be expressed by the double series VO +VI ?V2 +&c. +V'r-1+V'r-3+V'r-'+ &c., of which the first part converges at least as rapidly as the geometrical progression r (2) ()3 and the second at least as rapidly as 1 a12 3ae r X r Vr -if Vj, Vs denote homogeneous functions of x, y, z of the order i, each satisfying, continuously, for all values of x, y, z, the equation V2V=O. A proof of this proposition is given in TIoMSON and TAIT'S 'Natural Philosophy,' chap. i. Appendix B. It is also there shown, what 1rbelieve has been hitherto overlooked, that Vj,, Vi, as above defined, cannot but be rational and integral, if i is any positive integer. S. To avoid circumlocution, we shall call any homogeneous function of (x, y, z) which satisfies the equation V2V=o a "spherical harmonic function," or, more shortly, a "spherical harmonic." Thus V, and V,, as defined in ? 7, are spherical harmonics of degree or order i; and ,r-9ibeing also a solution of V2V=O, is a spherical harmonic of degree(i+1). We shall sometimes call the latter a spherical harmonic of inverse order i. Thus al being any spherical harmonic of integral degree i, and therefore necessarily a rational integral function of this degree, uir2i' is a spherical harmonic of degree (i+1), or of inverse order i. If we put-(i+ 1)=, and denote this last function by A, then we have and thus it appears that the relation between a spherical harmonic of positive degree i and of negative degree j is reciprocal. The general (well known) proposition on which this depends is that if Vi is any homogeneous function of (x, y, z) of degree i, positive or negative, integral or fractional, VYr-2i' is also a solution of the equation V2V=O (see THOMSON and TAIT'S ' Natural Philosophy,' chap. i. Appendix B.). A spherical harmonic of integral whether positive or negative degree, satisfying the differential equation continuously for all values of the variables, will be called an " entire spherical harmonic," because such functions are suited for the solution of acoustical and other physical problems regarding entire spheres or entire spherical shells. A spherical harmonic function of (x, y, z) will be. called a " spherical surface-har586 PROFESSOR W. THOMSON ON DYNAMICAL PROBLEMS REGARDING monic " when the point (x, y, z) lies anywhere on a spherical surface having its centre at the origin of coordinates. A spherical surface-harmonic is therefore a function of two variables, angular coordinates of a point on a spherical surface. If Yt denote such a function of order i, positive and integral, then YTri and Yjr-i-l are what we now call simply spherical harmonics; but sometimes we shall call them, by way of distinction, "spherical solid harmonics." Functions Yj, or spherical surface-harmonics of integral orders, have been generally called"; LAPLACE'S coefficients " by English writers. 9. From the theorem enunciated in ? 7, we see that the general solution of our problem, so far as b is concerned, is this: i . (8) 10. Now because the equation V2u=0 is linear, it follows that differential coefficients of any solution, with reference to x, y, z, or linear functions of such differential coefficients, are also solutions. Hence the terms V, and Vtr2'-', of , give harmonics of da dad the degrees i1 and (i+2), in -' 2, da To solve equations (3) we have therefore dy'd only to solve V2u=@" , where q5n denotes an entire spherical harmonic of any positive or negative degree, n. Trying U=Ar I which is obviously the right form, we have V2u=A{r2724p+ 4 (xd '+y d +Z A) 4p.+0P1V2(r2)} But, because ha is a homogeneous function of a, y, z of degree n, (x d+y d+zA 5n)~ n (dx B dy i:dz)n ao and because it is a spherical harmonic, V2p, -= 0. We have also V2(r) = 6, by differentiation. Hence V2u=A. 2(2n+ 3)Pn and therefore the complete solution of the equation 1$ V~~~u= + 'p 2(2n+3) where V denotes any solution of the equation v2Y=0. ELASTIC SPHEROIDAL SHELLS AND SPHEROIDS OF INCOMPRESSIBLE LIQUID. 587 11. Hence, by taking for Spn the terms of dd8 da above referred to (? 10), and giving n its proper value, i-1, or -(i+2), for each term as the case may be, we find, for the complete solution of (3), the following: ~~=~{u~ +z~r2~'-~ mr2 d1 tn 2(2i+ -) dx !3z{Vi +vr 2t1-'in. 2(2i+ 1) (Vi-V'r2i1)},.(9) W. + wi+r 2i-1 -( rlj-(Vi-V1 r2i~l} where uj5, u, vi, vi, w', wi denote six harmonics, each of degree i. 12. But in order that these formulae may express the solution of the original equations (1), the functions u, v, &c. must be related to the functions V so as to satisfy equations (2) and (3).

The circumstances for which this solution is appropriate will be understood when the general proposition of ? 7 is duly considered. 14. It remains to show how the harmonics ala vA, wiv I, vHi , w are to be determined so as to satisfy the superficial conditions. Let us first suppose these to be that the displacement of every point of the bounding surface is given arbitrarily. Let -Ai I Yw~i i Wi be the harmonic series f, expressing the three components of the displacement at any point of the outer surface of the shell, and -LAX, B W' the corresponding expressions for the given condition of the inner surface. Thus the surface-equations of condition to be fulfilled are a= o=Ai I r=a { 3=23ij . ~ ~ ~ ~ **(13) where a and a' denote the radii of the outer and inner surfaces respectively, and A, I Bi, CQ, A', B', C' spherical surface-harmonics of the order i. 15. Now collecting from the series (12) of ? 13, which constitute the general expressions for oak /3, Y, those terms which being either solid spherical harmonics of degrees i and -iI or such functions multiplied by r, give, at the boundary, surface-harmonics of the order i, and equating the terms of this order on the two sides of equations (13), we have* For the case i=n0, the terms i U may be omitted but their full interpretation would be to A express a displacement without deformation. Thus uV' being of degree -1, cannot but be -, where A is a constant; and therefore u r-2i+l becomes A when i=0. t That is, series of terms each of which is a spherical surface-harmonic of integral order i. That any function; arbitrarily given over an entire spherical surface, may be so expressed, is a well-known theorem. A demonstration of it is given in Tnoxsow and TAIr'S 'CNatural Philosophy,' chap. i. Appendix B, ? s.

These six equations would suffice to determine the six harmonics ni, vi, wi, u, vi, w, if Aij and 4-4' were known. For, since each of those six functions is a homogeneous function of x' y, z of order i, each of them divided by ri is a function of angular coordinates relative to the centre, and independent of r; and therefore if, for instance, we denote ui by rivw and u' by riA&, we have two unknown quantities w and w' to be determined by the two equations of condition relative to a for the outer and the inner surface. These equations may be written as follows, if we further denote d4+v1 by ra, and d(tP' ) dx dx by r~' l', because these are homogeneous functions of the orders i and i11 respectively: + ~ = A~a/~' +2[(2n+m)i+3n+m] 2[(2n+m)i-n] ga/2i+ 1 + t = Ata'i+ ' +2[(2n+m)i+3n+m] S 2[(2n+m)i-n] Resolving these equations for w and w', and returning to the original notation instead of W, la 5, al (ai+ 1A.ali+ 1A'.)ri + (a2i?3 a2i+3) Mj+ d4'? -(a2i-a2)MI 2d(Jj r ) r2i+1 (aa-)ti1' aiA')ri(aa )2i+1(a2 -a2)M +2 d (aa")2(a2i1 -a'~i') d(?2.1r~i+1) r2M+ a 2i61_ a2i+l a2i+1 where, for brevity, 2[(2n+m)i+3n+m] .(16) i-2 -2[(2n+m)a-n] J Introducing, also for brevity, the following notation, ai+1Ai-a'i+1At a2i+1_ al2i+1 I _(aa1)i+1(aiA'_ a.iA,) a2i+1 a2i+ I fa+2= 2i+,_1i,+IMi+2i Rr-2 d2i+ 1_ 2itl1 i-2 9 (aal)2i+1 a2 a'2) M (aal)2(a2i-I-af2i-), * * C i+2 a24+L-atrul i+2 Pli-2 a2i+1 a/2i+I i-2 590 PROFESSOR W.

The functions 4 and 4' being expressed in terms of the data of the problem by equations (22), (23), (17), (18), (16), we have only to use (19) and (20) in (12) to find the following expression of the complete solution: C ~ ~ ~ ~~~~~M~)duv d(44 +19,-V3) :a={S firiG~i + W Ai -3r2i+3-ae @+i [g2i+ 5+ azMr2 (y+d)} = ~~ r~~-j~~ r ~ ' ~~ d xi_ d x f'lr 2 (3=f{3i r,+?3,r-i+ (g,[*f r'2i3 _Mir2) ddI (or 2 i_5?'M'52) d(4Mi, )} [(24) 4r'+ 'M'2 d(~ir' + (fI r2i+ Mir2) d1( Er2i+5+.M--r,') dz 3) 19. This solution leads immediately, through an extreme case of its application, to the solution of the general problem for a plate of elastic substance between two infinite parallel planes:-Given the displacement of every point of its surface, required the displacement of any interior point. For if we give infinite values to a and a', and keep a--a' finite, the spherical shell becomes an infinite plane plate. 20. It is, however, less easy to deduce the result in this way from the solution for the spherical shell, than to apply directly the general method of ? 6 to the case of the infinite plane plate. We shall return to this subject (? 31, below), when the details of the investigation will be sufficiently indicated. 21. A very important part of the general problem proposed in ? 1 remains to be considered,-that in which not the displacement, but the arbitrarily applied force, is given all over the surface. To express the surface-equations of condition for such data, we must use the formulae expressing the stress (or force of elasticity) in any part of an elastic solid in terms of the strain (or deformation) of the substance. These are P=(m+n) +(m-n )(dx]); Q=(r~n~ +(n-a (@Y +d-)I Q =(m+n) d +(MX-n) (d y) ,...(5 (2 5) S=nf I ry/ T=n(+d)Un yd; s where P, Q, R are the normal tractions (which when negative are pressures) on the faces of a unit cube respectively perpendicular to the lines of reference OX, OY, OZ, and S, T, U the tangential forces along the faces respectively parallel, and in the directions in these planes respectively perpendicular, to OX, OY, OZ (see Appendix, ? 70). 22. In terms of these we have the following expressions for the components F, G, IT of the force on a unit area perpendicular to any line whose direction cosines are f, g, h F =Pf+Ug+Thl G=IUf+Qg+Sh4 . . ..

If now we suppose f, g, h to denote the direction-cosines of the normal at any point x, y, z of the surface of an elastic solid, the surface condition, when force, not displacement, is given, will be expressed by equating F, G, H respectively to three functions of the coordinates of a point in the surface, quite arbitrary except in so far as they must balance one another in order that equilibrium in the body may be possible; and therefore they must fulfil the following integral equations: $fFdQ=0, SSGdQ=o0, lSHd2=O. (28) ,(HyGz)dQ=0, SS(Fz--Hx)d2=20, SS(Gx-Fy)0 . .* (29) where d2 denotes an element of the surface at the point (x, Y, z), and the double integrals include the whole surface of application of the forces F, G, H. 25. For our case of the spherical shell, with origin of coordinates at its centre, we have x y z Of=p ' g=-Y' h=-. (30) and the last triple term in the expression (27) for F may be conveniently written thus: ndi(~x+ ly~yz) O ; (31) r dx r. Then, for brevity, putting .oat +By+ 7Z= 4 e * * * * * * * e * (32) and $ + +z r '(33) where d prefixed to any function of x, y, z will denote its rate of variation per unit of length in the radial direction; and using (2) of ? 3, we have, by (30) and the symmetrical. equations for G and H, Fr =(m )x * jI + 1 Gr(e-n)6.-y +nt (r d _1)i iW} ''*A (34\) Hr= (mnn)8 * z+n; (rW7r-1 It+dz}' 26. It is to be remarked that these equations express such functions of (v, y, z), the coordinates of any point P of the solid, that F .w, G. x, Ht. w are the three components of ELASTIC SPHEROIDAL SHELLS AND SPHEROIDS OF INCOMPRESSIBLE LIQUID. 593 the force transmitted across an infinitely small area w perpendicular to OP, while, for any point of either the outer or the inner bounding spherical surface, Fc, Gw, Hz are the three components of the force applied to an infinitely small element w of this surface. 27. To reduce the surface-equations of condition derived from these expressions to harmonic equations, let us consider homogeneous terms of degree i of the complete solution, which we shall denote by oa,, pi, ly, and let 4j-*, ;+ denote the corresponding terms of the other functions.

The second of the three terms of order i in these equations, when the general solution of ? 13 is used, become at the boundary each explicitly the sum of two surface harmonics of orders i and i-2 respectively. To bring the other parts of the expressions to similar forms, it is convenient that we should first express ;+j in terms of the general solution (12) of ? 13, by selecting the terms of algebraic degree i.

But the following order of proceeding is more convenient. Commencing with the first of the surface equations (46), multiplying it by (a) , attending to the degree of each term, and taking advantage of the principle that, if 4 be any homogeneous function of x, y, z, of degree t, the function of angular coordinates, or of the ratios xy: z, which it becomes at the spherical surface r=a, is the same as (r) 4 for any value of r, we have (i_' )d'+2) U 2iMi2a +1+2(i+1)M(+ya2 d4 1 dx ~~~~~~~~=i (47) a 2iId(+jjr 2i+lr 2i-1d(4_i_2r2i+3) 1 Fdt+1 (r\2i1 d_*i a Eir a -E-i-lad i1 o tn d dx dx 2Fi+1L dx J d where the second member, and each term of the first member, is now a homogeneous function of degree i, of x, y, z (being in fact a solid spherical harmonic of degree and d d d tosmercleutos dig order i). Taking Wof this, and and of the two symmetrical equations, adding, x ~~dy dzf h taking into account equations (38) and (39), and taking advantage of the equation V2V=O for the solid harmonic functions concerned, we have {[iI +(2i+1)iE,]-iI ,-2(i+ I)a -2i-'r 2i-@Ip-j-2(i+ 1)(21i+ 1)iM-i+,(-)-}| 1 +d(Airi) +d(Biri) +d(Ciri) (48) a, dx dy dz, Again, multiplying (47) by a'2r 2i-', and taking r2i+3d of the result, dealing similarly with the two symmetrical equations, and adding, we have 2ia p+ [i+2 -(2i+ 1)(i+1)Ei () i-2+2i(i+ 1)(2i+ 1)Mi+24'i+1 }l r2i+3 d(Air-ia) +d(Bir-i-1 ) +d(Cir-i-1) } 49 ai2 dx + dy + dz f Changing i into i-2 in this equation, we have -2)a~p@ -2[i-(2i3)(i-1)E +1](r) +_-+2(i-2)(i-1)(2i-3)M 24i Id(Aj-2r~i+') +d(Bj._2r-i+') td(Cj_2r-i+' )Jo afl dx + dy + dz j Precisely similar equations, derived from the inner surface condition of the shell, are obtained by changing a, A, B, C into a', A', B', C'. We thus have (48), (50), and the two corresponding equations for the inner surface, in all four equations, to determine the four unknown functions .,+i1 +-s, pi-II pos, in terms of the data which appear in the second members. The equations being simple algebraic equations, we may regard these four functions as explicitly determined. In other words, we may suppose pi and 'known for every positive or negative integral value of i. Then equation (47), the 596 PROFESSOR W. THOMSON ON DYNAMICAL PROBLEMS REGARDING -two equations symmetrical with it, and the others got by changing A, a, &c. into A', a', &c., give ui, vi, wi explicitly in terms of known functions, and the expressions (36) for ai, His yi complete the solution of the problem. 31. The solution for the infinite plane plate is of course included in the general solution for the spherical shell, as remarked above for the case in which surface displacements, not surface forces, were given; but, as in that case, it will be simpler and practically easier to work out the problem ab initio, taking advantage of the appropriate Fourier forms. The relative ease of the independent investigation is indeed still greater in the case in which the surface forces are given than in the other case, since the general expressions for the surface forces assume simple forms when the surface is plane, and require no such transformation as that which we have found necessary, and which has constituted the special difficulty of the problem, when the surface was spherical. The problem of the plane plate presents many questions of remarkable interest and practical importance; and although the object and limits of the present paper preclude any detailed investigation of special cases, we may make a short digression to work out the general solution. 32. Let the origin of coordinates be taken in one side of the plate and the axis OX perpendicular to it. Then, according to the general expressions (25) of ? 21, the three components of the force per unit of area, in or parallel to either side of the plate, are respectively parallel to OX, P =(mn+n) da+ (n-n)d (+d) parallel to OY, _ . . . (51) parallel to OZ, T =n ( +d) j The surface condition to be fulfilled is that each of these functions shall have an arbitrarily given value at every point of each infinite plane side of the plate. 33. From the indications of ? 6 above, it is easily seen that the following assunmptions are correct for a general solution of the equations of internal equilibrium, and convenient for the application at present proposed, a-U+X dp V +X df dp where u, v, W, and o denote functions of(r, y, z) which each fulfil the equation V2V=O.

Also, by differentiation and application of the equations V2U=.0, V2dp 0 we find -dxdy V =c2 dv-x, V20=2 dxdy V',Y=2 dxdz Hence, to satisfy the general equations of internal equilibrium (3) of ? 3, we must have df m dxm+2nt Hence the general solution becomes m+2n'P | mx dS+dx5 m+2n d mx dS dx rwU nJm+2n dz where u, v, w are any functions whatever which satisfy the general equation V2V-0, and ' is given by (52); and where, further, it must be understood that ~idx must be so assigned as to satisfy the equation V2V=O, which ' itself satisfies by virtue of (52). 34. The general form of the solution of V2V=0, convenient for the present application, is clearly ? s n(tz), where.p, s, t are three constants subject to the equation P2= S2 + P If now we suppose, as a particular case, the surface condition to be that P=A sin (sy) sin (tz), I U=B cos (sy) sin (tz), zwhen x=0, T=C sin (sy) cos (tz), and .(54) P=A'sin (sy) sin (tz),1 U=B'cos (sy) sin (tz), when x=a, T=C' sin (sy) cos (tz), MDCCCLXIII. 4 M 59;8 PROFESSOR W. THOMSON ON DYNAMICAL PROBLEMS REGARDING where A, B, C, A', B', C' are six given constants, we must clearly have ff (fU-9X+fI~Y) sin (sy) sin (tz), v=(gf1)x~g s) cos (sy) sin (tz), . e e . . e v (55) W=(hs-Px+h1~Y) sin (sY) coS (tz), J where f, g, hi f, g', h' are six constants to be determined by six linear equations obtained directly from (54), (51), (53), (52), (55). But, by proper interchanges of sines and cosines, we have in (54) a representation of the general terms of the series or of the definite integrals, representing, according to FOURER'S principles, the six arbitrary functions, whether periodic or non-periodic, by which P, U, T are given over each of the two infinite plane sides. Hence the solution thus indicated is complete. 35. To complete the theory of the equilibrium of an elastic spheroidal shell, we must now suppose every point of the solid substance to be urged by a given force. The problem thus presented will be reduced to that already solved, by the following simple investigation. 36. Let X, Y, Z be the components of the force per unit of volume on the substance at any point x, 9, z. (That is to say, let qX, qY, qZ be the three components of the actual force on a volume q, infinitely small in all its dimensions, enclosing the point (.rc, ?z). Not to unnecessarily limit the problem, we must suppose X, Y, Z to be each an absolutely arbitrary function of x, y, z. 37. When we remember that x, y, z are the coordinates of the undisturbed position of any point of the substance, and differ by the infinitely small quantities a, A, y from the actual coordinates of the same point of the substance in the body disturbed by the applied forces, we perceive that Xdx+Yd,+Zdz need not be the differential of a function of three independent variables. It actually will not be a complete differential if the case be -that of the interior kinetic equilibrium of a rigid body starting from rest under the influence of given constant forces applied to its surface, and having for their resultant a couple in a plane perpendicular to a principal axis. Nor will Xdxc+Ydy+Zdz be a complete differential in the interior of a steel barmagnet held at rest under the influence of an electric current directed through one half of its length, as we perceive when we consider FARADAY's beautiful experiment showing rotation to supervene in this case when the magnet is freed from all mechanical constraint. 38.

This solution is applicable of course to an elastic body of any shape. It enables us to determine the displacement of every point of it when any given force is applied to every point of its interior, and either displacements or forces are given over the whole surface, if we can solve the general problem for the same shape of body with arbitrary superficial data, but no force on the interior parts. For 'a, '3, 'y are determined by the solution of this problem, to be worked out with the given arbitrary superficial functions modified by the subtraction from them of terms due to the parts of a, 3, r which are explicitly shown in terms of data by equations (64) and (65). 41. Hence the problem of ? 35 is completely solved,-whether we have displacements given over each of the two concentric spherical bounding surfaces, when the solution of ?t 1-4-18 determines 'oc, '/3, 'y; orforces given over the boundary, when the solution of ?? 26-30 is available. In the former case the superficial values of the functions 1/m d-\ nt m+n dax i m d\\ nt m+n dye 1/ m da\ nt 61 dz} known from equations (65), must be subtracted from the arbitrary functions given as the superficial values of a, /3, y, and the residues, expressed in surface-harmonic series by the known method, will be the harmonic expressions for the superficial values of '1s, 'P/, 'r In the latter case, we must first substitute those known functions &c., instead of a, /3, y respectively in (34), and the values of Fr, Gr, Hr thus found must be subtracted from the given arbitrary functions representing the true ELASTIC SPHEROIDAL SHELLS AND SPHEROIDS OP INCOMPRESSIBLE LIQUID. 601 superficial values of Fr, Gr, Hr. The remainders, which we may denote by 'Fr, 'Gr, 'Hr, must then be reduced to harmonic series, as in (45), and used according to the investigation of ? 30, to determine 'ac, 'f, 'r* 42. The general solution (64) and the expression just indicated for the terms to be subtracted from the data so as to find 'Fr, 'Gr, 'Hr, becomes much simplified when, as in some of the most important practical applications, Xdx+Ydy+Zdz is a complete differential. Thus let dW dW dW -X=< -Ydy ' -Z= dz.(67) W denoting any function of x, y, z. Then, assuming, as we may do according to (65), ai dV-2W dy d V-2W we have by differentiating, &c., dx dy dz and therefore .=V-2W.

These expressions become further simplified if W is a homogeneous function of any positive or negative integral or fractional order i+1, in which case we shall denote it by Wj+ .

Hence d d rdr (i+ 2) d Hence the preceding become Fr m+n{(m n)Wi+l x+2n(i+2) d} +'Fr, Gr= m+nj(m-n)Wi+l y-+2n(i+2) t +'Gr, .(72) Hr= m~n{(mn)Wi+l z+2n(i+2)d+'Hr. 44. These expressions are the more readily reduced to the harmonic forms proper for working out the solution, if the interior force potential, W+lI, is itself a harmonic function. We then have (? 10) I r2W d3 1 ( Wi+,+r2dWi+l) 2(2i+5) dx-2i+5 i 2 dx and 73) W. d Ti+l d(Wi+1r-2i-3) J which give 1m+(i+l)n dW+l m(2i+5)-n r2d(W+-2i-3 (74) m+n 2i+3 dx -(2i+3)(2i?5) d( xI X .}+i. and symmetrical expressions for Gr and Hr. Here the terms to be subtracted from the arbitrary functions given to represent the superficial values of Fr, Gr, and Hr are each explicitly expressed in sums of two surface harmonics of orders i or -i-1, and i+2 or -i3 respectively, viz., in each case, that one of the two numbers which is not negative. 45. When the shell is in equilibrium under the influence of the forces. acting on it through its interior, without any application of force to its surface, we must have Fr =0,' Grr=O, when r=a and when r-a'. (75) Hr=T J ELASTIC SPHEROIDAL SHELLS AND SPHEROIDS OF INCOMPRESSIBLE LIQUID. 603 Hence, for the case in which W is a spherical harmonic, the preceding equations give the proper harmonic expressions for 'Fr, 'Gr, 'Hr at the outer and inner bounding surfaces, for determining 'a '3, 'y by the method of t? 28-30. Thus, using all the same notations, with the exception of 'a, '/3, 'y, F, 'G, 'H, instead of a, /, ry, F, G, H, and, for the present, supposing i+1 to be positive*, we have the complete harmonic expressions of TF, 'G, 'H, each in two terms, of orders i 'and i+2 repectively. Hence the A, A', &c. of (45) are given by the following equations: Ai At m+(i?l)n _idWdi+ a i+1 (2i+3)(m+n)"r dx B, B,_ m+(i+l)n ri dWi+ I ai+1 ali+ (2i+3)Q(mn) dy C, C, M m+(i+1)n ridWi+l1 di+1 dti+ ~(2iJr3)(m+n) dz i eii (6 A,+2_ A42 (2i+ 5)m-n r 3d(Wi+ir a'VT aIi+ (2i + 3) (2i + 5) (m + n) dx Bi+2 B42 (2i+5)m-n r+3 d(W,+1r-2W-3) -d+' ati+1 (2i+3)(2i+5)(m n) ndy Ci+2 C+2(2i+5)m-n r+3 d(Wi+7r) ai+1 ai+' (2i +3) (2i +5) (m +n) dz 46. The functions derived from Ai, B,, C,, &c., which are required for formulae (48) and (49), are therefore as follows:d(Airi) +d(B;ri) d(Ciri) =o dx dy dz d(Ari') d(Bor-i-') d(Cr-'-) (i+?)(2i+1)[m+(i+I)n] ai+1 dx + dy + dz (2i+3)(m+n) 7.2i+3Wi+l7 d(Ai+2ri+2) d(Bi+2ri+2) d(C+;ri+2) (i+2)[(2i+5)m-n] a'l ( dxz dy . y .

Hence by (48) and (50), and the two corresponding equations for the inner surface, we infer that each of the four functions 't-4 4c, i'p., vanishes. By the same equations, with i changed into i+2, we obtain expressions, all of one harmonic form, direct or reciprocal, as follows, for the four functions of order i+1: * As we shall not in the present paper consider particularly any ease of a shell influenced by centres of force in the hollow space within it, which alone could gve a potential Wi+i of negative degree, we need not write any of the e~xpressions in forms convenient for making i + 1 negative. 604 PROFESSOR W.

Lastly, by the four equations with (i+4) instead of i, we find that 'i+3, 4-i-4, i+31 -i-4 all vanish. Using these results for + and p in (47), we see that each of the functions t must be a harmonic congruent with either dx+l or d(Wi+r-2i3) Hence by using (78) in (38) and (39) we dx ~~dx find Li+, dWi+l K+ d1Ai-V+ 1 (2i+ 1)(i+ 1) dx ' (2i+ 1)(i+ 1) dx -Kj+j ~+ d(Wiflr-2i-3) -L. d(Wi ir-N-~3).

For this we have J-i-20 0, and 0-i-2=0, as we see at once from the character of the problem, or as we find by putting a'= 0 in the four equations by which in ? 46 we have seen that K+ 1, K+1, 5Lil, L41 are to be determined.

It is easy to verify this result, by testing that (56) (with -X--d i, &c.) is satisdxv fied for every point of the solid, and that equations (34) give F=0, G=0, H=0 at the bounding surface, r=a. 48. The case of i=1 is, as we shall immediately see, of high importance. For it the preceding expressions, (83) and (80), become -10(4m-n)a2+ (21m-5n)?2 2 e2lOn(19m-5n) CM 4mr7l 10n(19m-5n) I _dW r d ), .(84) dXV2r+ (ed(W"T2 r-5) C= @2 dy +@2 dy r= d2 + I, (dW2 ?-') dz 2 z 49. As an example of the application of t? 45-48, let us suppose a spherical shell or solid sphere to be equilibrated under the influence of masses collected in two fixed external points*, and each attracting according to the inverse square of its distance.Let the two masses M, M' be in the axis OX; and, P being the point whose coordinates are x, y, z, let PM=D, PM'=D'. Let also OM = , OM'=c'.Xy~ ~ j, 7 ~~~ '1' /-Then, if m, m' denote the trwo masses, for equilibrium we must have mm c2 C2 * If our limits permitted, a highly interesting example might be made of the case of a shell under the influence of a single attracting point in the hollow space within it. The effect will clearly be to keep the whole shell sensibly in equilibrium even if the attracting point is excentric; and under stress even if the attracting point is in the centre. MDCCCLXIII. 4 N 9606 PROFESSOR W. THOMSON ON DYNAMICAL PROBLEMS REGARDING The potential at P, due to the two masses, will be m+my' or, according to the notation of ? 42, with, besides, w taken to denote the mass of unit volume of the elastic solid, -W=w( + m)l The known forms in the elementary theory of spherical harmonics give immediately the development of this in a converging infinite series of solid harmonic terms. We have only then to apply the solution of ?? 45, 46 to each term, to obtain a series expressing the required solution. 50. We may work out this result explicitly for the case in which both masses are very distant; and for simplicity we shall suppose one of them infinitely more distant than the other; that is to say, we shall suppose it to exercise merely a constant balancing force on the substance of the shell. We shall then have precisely the same bodily disturbing force as that which the earth experiences from the moon alone, or from the sun alone. 51. Referring to the diagram and notation of ? 49, we have D--~{1+Z+x-_"2( ?z2)} if we neglect higher powers of c) Y, c than the square; and neglecting all higher powers of i, ?-, . Hence, taking account of the relation m C c Cc2d required for equilibrium, we have, for the disturbance potential, -W = I 2 _ l 2 _ 12) an irrelevant constant being omitted from the expression which ? 49 would give. This being, a harmonic of the second degree, we may use it for Wool, putting i= 1 in the formulae of ? 47, and thus solve the problem of finding the deformation of a homogeneous spherical shell 'under the influence of a distant attracting mass and a uniform balancing force. I hope, in a future communication to the Royal Society, to show the application of this result to the. case of the lunar and solar influence on a body such as the earth is assumed to be by many geologists-that is to say, a solid crust, constituting a spheroidal shell, of some thickness less than 100 miles, with its interior filled with liquid. The untenability of this hypothesis is, however, sufficiently demonstrated by the considerations adduced in a previous communication (" On the Rigidity of the Earth," read May 8, 1862), in which the following explicit solution of the problem for a homogeneous solid sphere only is used.

The condition of the body being symmetrical about the axis of x, we may conveniently assume ~Y=ycosp, z=ysin , 132 ?72 2 so that we shall have (as we see by the preceding expressions) P=P cos @, y=(ksinp, and (s will denote the component displacement perpendicular to OX. If, further, we assume xr rcos, y=r sin 0, the expressions (84) for the component displacements, with (85) used in them, give M=W'{-2rE2+, 2(5 cos2 _3)}cosId, (W { re2+34(5cos2 0-. 1)}sin A The values given in (84) for 2 and 2 are to be used for any internal point, at a'distance r from the centre, in these equations (86), and thus we have the simplest possible expression for the required displacement of any point of the solid. 53. If we resolve the displacement along and perpendicular to the radius, and consider only the radial component, we see that the series of concentric spherical surfaces of the undisturbed globe become spheroids of revolution in the distorted body. The elongation of the axial radius, obtained by putting d=O and taking the value of a, is double the shortening of the equatorial radius, obtained by putting d=sr and taking the value of (; which we might have inferred from the fact, shown by the general equations (80) above, that there can be no alteration of volume on the whole within any one of these surfaces.

AppENix, ?t 59-71.-General Theory of the Equilibrium of an Elatic Sold. 59. Let a solid composed of matter fulfilling no condition of isotropy in any part, and not homogeneous from part to part, be given of any shape, unstrained, and let every point of its surface be altered in position to a given distance in a given direction. It is required to find the displacement of every point of its substance in equilibrium. Let x, y, z be the coordinates of any particle, P, of the substance in its undisturbed position, and x+M, y+p, z+y its coordinates when displaced in the manner specified; that is to say, let ag, Ae ty be the components of the required displacement.

OF THE EQUILIBRIUM OF AN ELASTIC SOLID. 611 60. Let i, , G be the undisturbed coordinates of a particle infinitely near P, relatively to axes through P parallel to those of x, y, z respectively; and let E,,, ?, be the coordinates, relative still to axes through P, when the solid is in its strained condition.

Hence the thermodynamic principles by which, in a paper on the Thermoelastic Properties of Matter in the first Number of the ' Quarterly Mathematical Journal' (April 1855), GREEN's dynamical theory of elastic solids was demonstrated as part of the modern dynamical theory of heat, show that if w. dxdydz denote the work required to alter an infinitely small undisturbed volume, dxdydz, of the solid, into its disturbed condition, when its temperature is kept constant, we must have w =f(A, B, C, a, b, c) . . . . . . . . . . (102) where J denotes a positive function of the six elements, which vanishes when A-1, B-i, C -, a, b, c each vanish. And if W denote the whole work required to produce the change actually experienced by the whole solid, we have W-SSS wdxdydz .(103) where the triple integral is extended through the space occupied by the undisturbed solid. 62. The position assumed by every particle in the interior of the solid will be such as to make this a minimum, subject to the condition that every particle of the surface takes the position given to it, this being the elementary condition of stable equilibrium.

From the property of w that it is necessarily positive when there is any strain, it follows that there must be some distribution of strain through the interior which shall make iSSwdxdydz the leastpossible, subject to the prescribed surface condition, and there fore that the solution of equations (106), subject to this condition, is possible. If, whatever be the nature of the solid as to difference of elasticity in different directions, in any part, and as to heterogeneousness from part to part, and whatever be the extent of the change of form and dimensions to which it is subjected there cannot be any internal configuration of unstable equilibrium, or consequently any but one of stable equilibrium, with the prescribed surface displacement and no disturbing force on the interior, then, besides being always positive, W must be such a function of A, B, &c. that there can be only one solution of the equations. This is obviously the case when the unstrained solid is homogeneous. 64. It is easy to include, in a general investigation similar to the preceding, the effects of any force on the interior substance, such as we have considered particularly for a spherical shell, of homogeneous isotropic matter, in ?? 35-46 above. It is also easy to adapt the general investigation to superficial data of force, instead of displacement. 65. Whatever be the general form of the function f for any part of the substance, since it is always positive it cannot change in sign when A-1, B-i, -I, a, 6, c have their signs changed; and therefore for infinitely small values of these quantities it must be a homogeneous quadratic function of them with constant coefficients. (And it may be useful to observe that for all values of the variables A, B, &c., it must therefore be expressible in the same form, with varying coefficients, each of which is always finite, for OF THEEEQUILIBRIUM OF AN ELASTIC 'SOLID. -613 all values of the variables.) Thus, for infinitely small strains, we have GREEN'S theory of elastic solids, founded on a homogeneous quadratic function of the components of strain, expressing the work required to produce it. Putting A-1=2e, B-1=2f, C-1=2g .(107) and denoting by 2(e, e), (f, f), ... (e, f), . . . (e, a), ... the coefficients, we have w=!{(e, e)e2+(ff)f +(g, g)g +(aa)a +(b, b)b2 +(c)c} { +(elf )ef +(e, g)eg +(e, a)ea +(e, b)eb +(e, c)ec +(f, g+(f, a)+ (f, b)fb +(f, c)fc . (18 +(g, a)ga +(g, b)gb +(g, c)gc +(a, b)ab +(a, c)ac + (b, c)be The twenty-one coefficients in this expression constitute the twenty-one coefficients of elasticity, which GREEN first showed to be proper and essential for a complete theory of the dynamics of an elastic solid subjected to infinitely small strains. 66. When the strains are infinitely small, the products T d dcW &c. are each dA dx ddz infinitely small, of the second order. We therefore omit them; and then, attending to (107), we reduce (106) to d dw ddw + d dw Txc de dydc di dbh~ d dw ddw d dw TX + f + , = W. (109) d dwddw d dw dgT d+dy+ da +dy= which are the equations of interior equilibrium. Attending to (108) we see that ?w **, d *** are linear functions of e, f, g, a, b, :c the components of strain. Writing out de da one of them as an example, we have dw T=(e, e)e+(ef)f+(e, g)g+(e, a)a+(e, b)b+(e, c)C. . . .

MfDCcCCIxII. 4 o 614 PROFESSOR W. THOMSON ON THE GENERAL THEORY 67. It is now easy to prove directly, for the case of infinitely small strains, that the solution of the equations of interior equilibrium, whether for a heterogeneous or a homogeneous solid, subject to the prescribed surface condition, is unique. For let a, /3 y be components of displacement fulfilling the equations, and let a', /3', y' denote any other functions of (x, y, z) having the same surface values as a, /3, r, and let e', f',. .. i' denote functions depending on them in the same way as ef,..., w depend on oy, I, r. Thus, by TAYLOR'S theorem, WI -w -e) +V d -) + da -a) + db + T c)+H, where H denotes the same homogeneous quadratic function of e'e, &c. that w is of e, &c. If for e'-e, &c. we substitute their values by (111), this becomes dw d(al a) dw d(a'a) dw d(o'a) W W-de dx + db dz + dc dy +c.+1. Multiplying, by dxdydz, integrating by parts, observing that ' -a, /'-/, y'r vanish at the bounding surface, and taking account of (109), we find simply ESS(w'-w)dxdydzzSSSHdxdydz. (112) But H is essentially positive. Therefore every other interior condition than that specified by (as, /3, y), provided only it has the same bounding surface, requires a greater amount of work than w to produce it: and the excess is equal to the work that would be required to produce, from a state of no displacement, such a displacement as superimposed on (ce, /3, y) would produce the other. And inasmuch as (e, /3, y) fulfil only the conditions of satisfying (1-10) and having the given surface values, it follows that no other than one solution can fulfil these conditions. 68. But (as has been remarked by Professor STOKES to the author) when the surface data are of force, not of displacement, or when force acts from without, on the interior substance of the body, the solution is not in general unique, and there may be configurations of unstable equilibrium, even with infinitely small displacement. For instance, let part of the body be composed of a steel bar magnet; and let a magnet be held outside in the same line, and with a pole of the same name in its end nearest to one end of the inner magnet. The equilibrium-will be unstable, and there will be positions of stable equilibrium with the inner bar slightly inclined to the line of the outer bar, unless the rigidity of the rest of the body exceed a certain limit. 69. Recurring to the general problem, in which the strains are not supposed infinitely small, we see that, if the solid is isotropic in every part, the function of A, B, C, a, b, c which expresses w must be merely a function of the roots of the equation* (A2)(B2)(C 2) _a2(A_2) _b2(B ?2) c2(C C2) + 2abc-0 . (113) which (that is the positive values of A) are the ratios of elongation along the principal* THOMSoN and TAIT'S Natural Philosophy,' ? 181 (11). OF THE EQUILIBRIUM OF AN ELASTIC: SOLID. 615 axes of the strain-ellipsoid. It is unnecessary here to enter on the analytical expression of this condition. For the case of A-I, B-1, C-1, a, b, c, each infinitely small, it obviously requires that (e, e)=(f f)=(g g);y (}f g)=(g, e)=z(e,f); (a, a)=(b, b)=(c, c); (e, a)=(f, b)=(g, c) 0 ; (b, c)=(, a)=(am b)=0; . (114) and {As\{5t\tbae, b)=(e c)=(f, c )=(f a)=(g, a)=(g, baO. Thus the twenty-one coefficients are reduced to three(e, e), which we may denote by the single letter 21 (a, a)l ,, ,5 Ad n.~ It is clear that this is necessary and sufficient for ensuring cubic isotropthat is to say, perfect equality of elastic properties with reference to the three rectangular directions OX, OY, OZ. But for spherical isotropy, or complete isotropy with reference to all directions through the substance, it is further necessary that .-=n *****. (115) as is easily proved analytically by turning two of the axes of coordinates in their own plane through 450; or geometrically by examining the nature of the strain represented by any one of the elements a, b6, (a " simple shear") and comparing it with the resultant of c, and f -e (which is also a simple shear). It is convenient now to put 1+Z3=2mso that 2=m+n, 1=3m-n; . . 4 . (116) and thus the expression for the potential energy per unit of volume becomes 2w=m(e+f+g)2+n(e2+f2+g2-2fg-2ge-2ef+ea+2? 62. . . . (117) Using this in (108), and substituting for e, f g, a, b, c their values by (111), we find immediately, for the equations of internal equilibrium, equations the same as (1) of ?.2. 70. To find the mutual force exerted across any surface within the solid, as expressed by (26) of ? 22, we have clearly, by considering the works done respectively by P, Q, R, S T, U (? 21) on any infinitely small change of figure or dimensions in the solid, dw dw dw ddw dw dw -de Q df X =dy da X A=dbXU de 18 Hence, for an isotropic solid, (117) gives the expression (25) of ? 21, which we have used above. 71. To interpret the coefficients m and n in connexion with elementary ideas as to the elasticity of the solid; first let a=b==-O, and--e=f-g=g ; in other words, let the substance experience a uniform dilatation, in all directions, producing an expansion of volume from 1 to 1 + . In this case (117) becomes w=Xm ?~2 616 ON THE GENERAL THEORY OF THE EQUILIBRIUM OF AN ELASTIC SOLID. and we have dw C8 = 3 Hence (m--ln)k is the normal force per unit area of its surface required to keep any portion of the solid expanded to the amount specified by k. Thusm31-n measures the elastic force called out by, or the elastic resistance against, change of volume: and viewed as a coefficient of elasticity, it may be called the elasticity of volume. What is commonly called the "I compressibility" is measured by m v And let next e=f=-g=b=c -Owhich gives w=v na2; and, by (118), S=na. This shows that the tangential force per unit area required to produce an infinitely small shear*, amounting to a, is na. Hence n measures the innate power with which the body resists change of shape, and returns to its original shape when force has been applied to change it; that is to say, it measures the rigidity of the substance. [-NOTE added, December 1863]. Since this paper was communicated to the Royal Society, the author has found that the solution of the most difficult of the problems dealt with in it, which is the determination of the effect produced on a spherical shell by a prescribed application of force to its outer and inner surfaces, had previously been given by LAMP in a paper published in LIOUVILLE'S Journal for 1854, under the title "Memoire sur l'Ftquilibre l'6lasticite des enveloppes spheriques." In the same paper LAME shows how to take into account the effect of internal force, but does not solve the problem thus presented except for the simple cases of uniform gravity and of centrifugal force. The form iin which the analysis has been applied in the present paper is very different from that chosen by LIAME (who uses throughout polar coordinates); but the principles are essentially the same, being merely those of spherical harmonic analysis, applied to problems presenting peculiar and novel difficulties.* THOMSON and TAIT'S I Natural Philosophy,' ? 171.
