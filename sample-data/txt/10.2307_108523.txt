[ 299 ] XV. On a Class of Djflrential Equations, including those which occur in Dynamical Problems.-Part II. By W. F. DONKIN, M.A., F.R.S., F.R.A.S., Savilian Professor of Astronomy in the University of Oxford. Received February 17,-Read March 22, 1855. THE following paper forms the continuation and conclusion of one on the same subject presented to the Royal Society last year, and printed in the Philosophical Transactions for 1854. I have however put it, as far as possible, in such a form as to be independently intelligible. The fourth Section (the first of this Part) contains a recapitulation of some of the most important results of the former Part, in the form of seven theorems, here enunciated without demonstration. In the fifth Section the method of the variation of elements is treated under that aspect which belongs to it in connexion with the general subject. It is applied, by way of example, to deduce the expressions for the variations of the elliptic elements of a planet's orbit from the results of art. 30 (Part I.), on undisturbed elliptic miotion; this example was chosen, partly because the resulting expressions are required in a future section, and partly for the sake of incidentally calling attention to a fallacy which has been, perhaps, often committed, and certainly seldom noticed. The same method, under a slightly different and possibly new point of view, is applied, as a second example, to the problem of the motion of a free simple pendulum, omitting the effect of the earth's rotation. I believe the methods of this paper might be advantageously employed in the treatment of that general form of the problem of a free pendulum which has been considered by Professor HANSEN in his Prize Essay. I was unwilling, however, to attempt what might have turned out to be merely an unconscious plagiarism, without having seen the Essay in question, of which I only succeeded in obtaining a copy on the day of writing this preface. As I now perceive that the investigation would be quite independent, I hope to enter upon it at some future time. The sixth Section contains some general theorems concerning the transformation of systems of differential equations of the form considered in this paper, by the substitution of new variables. The most important case consists in the transformation from fixed to moving axes of coordinates, in dynamical problems. Some of the results are, I think, interesting, and perhaps new. The seventh and last Section contains an application of the preceding theorems, in connexion with the variation of elements, to the transformation of the differential MDCccLv. 2 s 300 PROFESSOR DONKIN ON TIlHE equations of the planetary theory. This investigation, if interesting at all, will piobably be so to the mathematician rather than to the astronomern. I think, however, that if the theories of physical astronomy were more frequently treated rigorously and symmetrically, apart from any approximate integrations; and if, when the latter are introduced, more care were taken to give a clear and exact view of the nature of the reasoning employed, it might be possible to draw the attention and secure the cooperation of a class of mathematicians who now may well be excused, if, after a slight trial, they turn from the subject in disgust, and prefer to expatiate in those beautiful fields of speculation which are offered to them by other branches of modern geometry and analysis. The contents of the two last Sections are more or less closely connected with the subjects of various memoirs by other writers, especially Professor HANSEN and the Rev. B. BRONWIN. I cannot pretend to that degree of acquaintance with them which would enable me to give an exact statement of the amount of novelty to be found in my own researches. I believe it is enough to justify me in offering them to the Society; beyond this I make no claim. Oxford, Feb. 15, 1855. SECTION IV. 49. The following theorems were demonstrated in the former part of this essay, and are recapitulated here for convenience of reference. (As before, total differentiation with respect to the independent variable t will, in general, be denoted by accents, which 'will be used for no other purpose.) Theorem I.-If X be a function of n variables xi, X2, ... x., and if yl, Y2, ... yn be n other variables connected with the former by the n equations dX dX dX d1 yld2 n d yi . . . . . . (5 ) then will the values of xl, X2, ... xSn expressed by means of these equations in terms of,, ....yn be of the form dY dY dY Al=dy5X2 W 51'2 dy, tndy ****** . and if p be any other quantity explicitly contained in X, then also dX dY dp + dp =?0 . . . . . . . . . . . . (52.) (the differentiation with respect to p being in each case performed only so far as p appears explicitly in the function). The value of Y is given by the equation Y=-(X)+(xl)yl+(x,2)y2+ *.+(X.)Yn, (53.) where the brackets indicate that xi ... x*, are supposed to be expressed in terms of ay sun (arts 2, 3.). DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS OF DYNAMICS, ETC. 301 Theorem II.-Suppose the function X to contain explicitly, besides the n variables h... x,,, another variable t, and also n constants a,, a2, ,. a,,; and in addition to the equations (50.), let the following be assumed: dX dX . = (54.) daj an n where b1, ... be are n other constants; so that, by virtue of the 2n equations (50.), (54.), the 2n variables xl... xq, y ...y, , may be considered as functions of the 2n constants a1,... al, h., ... b, and t. Then if from the equations (50.), (54.), and their total differential coefficients with respect to t, the 2n constants be eliminated, there will result the following 2n simultaneous differential equations of the first order; viz.dZ , dZ idy i= X(55.) where Z is a function of Xi ...x, yj, ... yX, (which will in general also contain t explicitly), and is given by the equation Z =-(dd-X) w * * * * * * * * * *(56.) dX In this equation -drepresents the partial differential coefficient of X taken with respect to t so far as t appears explicitly in the original expression for X in terms of xi .,, a, .. an and t; and the brackets indicate that a1, ... a, are afterwards to be expressed in terms of the variables by means of the equations (50.), (arts. 5, 6.) Theorem III.-Let the supposition that the 2n variables xl ... yx . ...y, are expressed in terms of the 2n constants and t, be called Hypothesis I.; and the converse supposition that a ... a,, b1 ... be are expressed in terms of the 2n variables and t, Hypothesis II.; then will the following relations subsist: de_ dl& dxi da daj dy i'dbj dyil 5 > * * * * ? e * @ ~~~~~(5 7.) dyi dbj dy,__ dayj da1 d,' dbJ dxj (In each of these equations the first member refers to Hyp. I., and the second to FYp. II.; and since there is no connexion between the indices of the variables and those of the constants the case of i=j has no peculiarity.) Theorem IV.-Let the symbol [p, q] be an abbreviation for the expression dp dj dp dqX d y-dyt dxo dx i dy i (where p, q are any functions of the 2n variables, which may also contain any other quantities explicitly; and the differentiations are performed only so far as xj,&c.y&c. appear explicitly in p, q); then if al, ... a,, ha,.. b, be expressed (IHp. II.) in terms of the 2n variables and t, the following equations subsist identically: [as, bJ--[b , a] =1, [at, b1 =[ate A]=[be b] = * . (58.) 2 s2 302 PROFESSOR DONKIN ON THE (i being different from j); and obviously in all cases [p q]-[q p], and [p, p] = 0 (art. 9.). Theorem V.-If u, v be either (1) any two functions whatever of the 2n constants a, &c., b,, &c., or (2) any two functions whatever of the 2n variables xw, &c., y, &c. (which may in either case also contain t explicitly)*, then { du dv _ du d du du du dv) dYi dWx dxi dyT J T Ldai dbi dbi fa(i (When u, v represent functions of the constants, the differential coefficients in the first member of this equation refer to Hyp. II.; and, when functions of the variables, those in the second member refer to Ilyp. I.) (art. 10.). Theorem VI.-Let x,, ... xn, y, ... ye be 2n variables concerning which no supposition is made except that they are connected by n equations of the form as X2.X*' ,n) Yin y2 .. ye).(a.) (where the functions on the right are only subject to the condition that the n equations (a.) shall be algebraically sufficient to determine y,, ...yX in terms of xl, ..n. x) ai, &c., and may contain explicitly any other quantities besides xl, &c., y,, &c.). 'Then, if by means of the equations (a.) the n variables y1, Y2, ...y,, be expressed as functions of xi, X2, &c., al, &c.; in order that the (2 ) conditions dye dy1 dcj dxi may subsist identically, it is necessary and sufficient that each of the n(n2) expressions [ai, ao] vanish identically. Theorem VII.-Let Z be any function whatever of 2n variables xI ... x", yl ... yn, and t. If of the svstem of 2n simultaneous differential equations of the first order , dZ dZ Yi di i-xi ***( there be given n integrals involving n arbitrary constants al, a2, ... an, so that each of these constants may be expressed as a function Qf the variables x,, &c., y,, &c. (with or without t); then if the ~-(2 -) conditions [ai, aj] =0 subsist identically, the remaining n integrals may be found, as follows. By means of the n given integrals let the n variables y, ... yn be expressed in terms of xi, &c., al, &c.; and let (Z) be what Z becomes when y1 ... yn are thus expressed. These values of yl, y2 .. . y, and (Z), will be the partial differential coefficients with respect to X1, X2, ... Xn and t, of one and the same function; call this function X, then, since its partial differential coefficients are * It was inadvertently stated in art. 10, that u, v must not contain t explicitly. But it is evident that no such limitation is implied in the demonstration of the theorem. The preceding theorem is obviously a particular case of this; namely, the case in which u-I ay, v-j. DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS OF DYNAMICS, ETC. 303 all given (by the equations diX dX -(Z) , X may be found by simple integration, and is therefore to be considered a given function of xl, ... ,*, al, ... an and 1. The remaining n integrals are then given by the n equations dX dai-bi b.. b. being n new arbitrary constants. [On the [elation between this theorem and the theories of Sir W. R. HAMILTON and JACOBI, see arts. 15-20.] 50. Other results established in the former part will be referred to as occasion may require. To the theorems enunciated in the preceding article, the following may now be added. Returning to the equations (50.), (54.), (55.), we may observe, that if, in theJirst members of (55.), xi, yj be supposed expressed in terms of a,, &c., b&, &c. and t, then dx dyi -T,' -I may be written instead of x4, y'; since on this hypothesis the total differential coefficients of xi, yi are obtained by differentiating with respect to t as it appears explicitly. We have therefore dxi_ dZ dyi_ dZ dt dyi dt dXi where the first members refer to Hyp. I., and the second to Hyp. II. But since the equations (50.), (54.) involve a, b, exactly in the same way as they involve x, y, it is obvious that the same reasoning which leads to the equations just written, would lead, mutatis mutandis, to the following, which may be considered as an addition to the system of equations (57.) (Theorem III.): dai_ dZ dbi dZ.0 dt dbi' dt da' In these equations, aj, bi in thefirst members are supposed to be expressed in terms of the variables (Hyp. II.), whilst in the second members xl, &c., yi, &c. are supposed dX to be expressed in terms of the constants and t (Hyp. I.). As before, Z=t 3 but in (60.) Z is differently expressed, being what the Z of (55.) becomes when x,, &C., y1, &c. are expressed according to Hyp. I. It is to be remembered that all consequences deduced from the form of the system (50.), (54.) belong to the system of equations, obtained as in Theorem VII., which express the solution of the differential equations (I.). Such a solution will be called, as before, a normal solution; and the systern of equations obtained by expressing a,, &c., bl, &c. in terms of the variables and t, will be called a system of normal integrals. (See art. 20, and the note to art. 29.) 51. Let a,, &c., I,, &c. be called, as before, elements. If then c be any function of the elements, when the latter are expressed in ter ms of the var iables and t 304 PROFESSOR DONKIN ON THE (Hyp. II.), c becomes also a function of the same; and we have dc=, (dc dai dcdbi (dc dZ dc dZ dt dadt dbi dt1 4ai dbi db( da. (see the last article). But, by Theorem V., this becomes dc [c, Z]. (62.) It is worth observing that both this equation and (60.) might have been obtained indirectly as follows. Since c is constant, we have c'=0; that is, dc+ [Z. c] =0 (see (32.), art. 22.); this gives (62.), since [Z, c] =[c, Z], and again, by Theorem V., is changed into (61.); and if, in the latter, we put successively c=aj, c=bj, we obtain the system (60.). SECTION V.-On the Variation of Elements. 52. The following general problem includes, I believe, all the cases which occur in practice. Let P1, ... Pa, Q1, .... Q. be any functions whatever of the 2n variables xl ...xad) yi, ... yand t. It is required to express the 2n integrals of the system of 2n simultaneous differential equations of the first order xPi, y=Qi *.(63.) in the same form as the integrals (supposed given) of the canonical system dZ dZ W-i p drip . . . . . . . (I ) by substituting functions of t for the constant elements of the latter system. Suppose a normal solution (see end of art. 50.) of the system (I.) to be employed. The elements ai, bi represent the same functions of x1, &c., 'y, &c. and t as before, but ale now variable; consequently we have da ai + ai /dai, f da.j daid al= dt j dx dyYiJ dt + YAl Pi dxj yIJ with a similar expression for b'. But, by equations (57.) and (60.), these are immediately transformed into the following: V_ dZ Q dxj pdyjl ai= dbil{Q dbi Pj db-i} i dai Y 31dai jdaif where Z, Q, Pj, xj, yj in the second members are supposed to be expressed (Hyp. I.) in terms of the elements and t. Thus the system (63.) is transformed into a system involving the new variables aj, bi, instead of the original variables xi, yi. 53. If, instead of employing a set of normal integrals of the pattern system (I.), we take anzy complete set of integrals c,, c2, ... cB, then cl, &c. may be: considered as. DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS OF DYNAMICS, ETC. 305 functions of a1, &c., and again, through them, of the variables. We have then da dbc and if in this equation the values of al, &c. be introduced from the formula (E.) of the last article, the following expression results: c_={Z, ci}+y1(Qj{xp, Ci}-Pj{yj, Ci}) (in which the symbol {p, q} is used to denote Il d -dodp dq {dbk dak dak dbkA so that by (59.) (Theorem V.) we have {p, q}= [p, q]; but in {p, q} p and q are considered as functions of a1, &c., bl, &c., whilst in [p, q] they are considered as functions of xa, &c., yl, &c.). Now, consider ingp, q as functions of c,, &c., and through these, of a1, &c., we have (by reasoning exactly similar to that employed in deducing equation (24.), art. 9.) { p S} =2 { 2)C13} de, deps de,, de,) (the summation referring to all binary combinations of the indices a, {3). Hence we have, putting q--ci, {P Ci Ea {Can Ci} ) . (64.) and consequently the above expression for c' becomes cf={Z Ci +ci} (Q dPi ).(F.) an equation which is easily seen to become identical with (E.), art. 52, when c1...C2n represent al...a,* bl.. .b** 54. The simplest case is that in which the system of equations (63.), whose integrals are sought, are of the canonical form; that is, where dW, dW dye dQ i W being a given function of the variables (with or without t). In this case the formula (E.) becomes dZ dW idbi dbi I dW} AK.(65.) t d~a-i+ dqiJ whilst (F.) is easily found to be reducible, by the help of (64.), to either of the following forms: ci={Z, ci}-{W, cl ..(66.) 306 PROFESSOR DONKIN ON THE If we put W-Z+f2, so that fi may be called the "1 disturbing function," the above formulae become C b ({Qi cz}g).(69.) On the first of these forms see the note to art. 38. With respect to the form (69.), if we put for {ci, ca} its equivalent [ci, caJ,] or [ca, cJ (see Theorem V. art. 49.), we obtain the well-known expression cj= a ([C., ci] d no) The difference between this last form, and (69.) consists in this; that in the latter the coefficients [Ca, Cjl are obtained from the expressions for c1, C2, &c. in terms of the variables; whereas in (69.) the coefficients {ci, ca} are similarly obtained from the expressions for cl, &c. in terms of the normal elements a,, &c., b, &c.*; and when a normal solution of the undisturbed problem has been obtained, the latter process will generally be found much more convenient than the former, since the elements c,, &c. will usually be much simpler functions of the normal elements than of the variables. 55. In illustration of this, it will be worth while to deduce the expressions for the variations of the ordinary elliptic elements of a planets orbit from those of the normal elements given in art. 30. Let a and e be the semiaxis major and excentricity, the inclination of the orbit to a fixed ecliptic, v the longitude of the node, v the longitude of the perihelion, nt+(s) the mean longitude of the planet; longitudes being reckoned in the plane of the ecliptic (from a fixed origin) asfar as the node, and then on the plane of the orbit. As 1 fbt usual, n stands for Also let nt+(s)=nadt+s, so that s'=(s)+tn'.

(LAPLACE uses R with the opposite sign.) Those in the text agree (allowing for notation) with the expressions given by Professor HANSEN, Astr. Nachr.

[It will be observed that the formulae for I', of 1 at the end of the last article, (1o not agree with those of PONTE'COULANT (P. 330) for the variations of the corresponding quantities An n, p. The reason of this is as follows:-In PONT1'COULANT'S notation p expresses the same as I in this paper, and a the same as v. But w (the longitude of the perihelion) is not the same as r; the former being measured entirely in the plane of the orbit from a radius vector,fted in that planet, and assumed as the origin of longitudes. Consequently s, in PONTECOULANT (which we will call a for distinction), is not the same as (E) in the present paper. In fact, if we equate the expressions for the mean anomaly in the two notations, we have also it is evident that if we put 3 for the angle between the node and the origin from which w is measured, we have df3= -cosS dv, and rm=+13+w, so-that do= dw + (I1-cos :)dv. If then it were allowable to consider R as capable of being expressed as a function of w and A instead of f and (s), and if we represented by (R) the expression for R so transformed, we should have dRd dR d+ d(R)d d(R)d+ d dada d(s) +&c. dX)&+ ds)^+&C., and if, in the two first terms, we put for dw and d(s) the values da=dw+(l-cosi)dv, d(s)=ds,+(1 -cos :)dv, and compare the two expressions, we find dR d(R) dR d(R) dw dw 'd(?) de dR \dR dR d(R) W +(I cosl)\djdjT These relations, together with the equation WI il+ (I 1-Cos I)Vtn are easily seen to render the expressions at the end of art. 55 identical with those of PONTE'COULANT; in fact, it is by an equivalent transformation that the latter are finally obtained by that author from the correct expressions in p. 328. But it is to be observed that this proceeding is founded upon afalse assu nption; for it is impossible to express R as a function of a, e, l, v, , a as is obvious from the consideration that R, in its original form, is not a function of (s)-w merely, but also of (s); whilst (?) is not expressible as afunction of the new elements, as is shown by the equa. tion d(s) =de,++(I -cos:)dv .

See also Appendix B.] -57. Returning to the expression (69.), art. 54, it may be observed that the coefficients {ci, cj} are to be expressed in terms of C1, C2, &c., and this involves no difficulty when each of the two sets of elements cl, &c., a1, &c. can be expressed in terms of the other explicitly, as was thie case in the example just discussed. Suppose, however, that the normal set a1, &c., &, &c. are given in terms of the set cl, &c., but that it is impracticable or inconvenient to obtain the converse equations expressing the latter in terms of the former. In this case we inay proceed as follows. Adopting the notation of art. 1+, and puttingf, g for any two of the set c,, C2, &c., we have d(f, g) {f, g} = id (bj5 as); suppose this equation written at length, and then, after multiplying by ddb1, a, let each side be summed with respect to all binary combinationsf, g. The result is (see art. 1, equation (4.)), d( fg) . (70.) (the summation referring to the combinations f g). Again, if the forner equation be multiplied by d(p, q) where p, q represent any two of the normal elements, a, &c. d(f, g) 1 b1, &c., except a conjugate pair, and the sum be taken as before, we have :{fg}=... (71.) The two formulae (70.), (71.) give n(2n1) linear equations for determining the n(2n1) unknown quantities {J; g}; the coefficients of the latter being all given functions of c,, &c. But such cases will hardly occur in practice. (With respect to the form of the above system of linear equations, it is easy to show that the complete determinant of the coefficients is = 1.) 58. The integration of the formulae (65.), art. 53, would give the means of expressing the solution of the system x dW , dw Xi=-5 A-dmulae alluded to in a preceding note, as the various steps of it are to be found in different places, the notation is somewhat inconsistent, and the results do not profess to he rigorous. My impression is, however, that LAPLACE nowhere commits the fallacy of assuming (for example) that R is a function of r, v, z, or r, v, s (see vol. i. p. 295), where v is the angle described by the radius vector on the varying plane of the orbit. * See JACOBI'S two letters to Professor HANS5EN in CRELLE'S Journal, vol. xlii. t i. e. using d(u, v) as an abbreviation fordu dv du dv d(x, y) d 2 dy dy dT 2 T 2 310 PROFESSOR DONKIN ON THE in theform of a normal solution of any other similar system , dZ , dZ xi=yn yi=W ~dy-i ~~xi which may be chosen as the pattern. In the most usual examples the function to be chosen for Z is naturally suggested by the circumstance, that W presents itself under the form of the sum of two functions Z+f2, of which the former, taken alone, gives an integrable system. But this is not necessarily the case; and it is worth while to observe that the formule (65.) take a simple and remarkable form whatever Z may be, provided that it be a function not containing t explicitly. For then, assuming the "integral of vis viva," Z=h, as one of the normal integrals of the pattern system *, the element conjugate to h is X (the constant added to t); and observing that Z. in (65.), being expressed in terms dZ of the elements, reduces itself simply to I, we shall have I=1, whilst the differential coefficients of Z with respect to all the other elements vanish; so that, if we put a,, ... -a.-,, b, .b for the remaining elements, the system (65.) takes the following form:dW dW. 1 dW b dW as=-_d b-i 1bib= dai This, in dynamics, gives the process to be used in the following problern: "To express the solution of any dynamical problem in the form of the solution of any other (involving the same number of variables) in which the principle of vis viva subsists." 59. As an example of the above process we may apply it to determine the motion of a simple free pendulum (not taking into account the earth's rotation). Let I be the length of the pendulum, and let the mass of the material point m placed at its extremity be represented by unity. Also let x, y, z be the rectangular coordinates of m, the origin being at the position of rest of m, and the axis of Z directed vertically upwards. The equation to the sphere described by mn is x2+y2+Z2 2z=0, and theforce-function U is -gz. Hence if we take, as the two independent coordinates, the radius vector g of the projection of mn on the plane of xy, and the angle 0 between f and the axis of x, we shall have for the differential equations of motion, IdW __dW du dv . dW I dW I * See art. 19 (where hi in equation (29.) is a misprint for bi).

The above approximations would cease to be sufficiently accurate if b were very nearly equal to a, or the motion very nearly circular; but they apply to any other case, and in particular to that in which b is verv small, or the motion nearlv rectilinear. In the case of nearly circular motion, it would be necessary to develope sec in a series of powers of a2-b2, and the results would be applicable whether p were smnall or not. But I shall not pursue this subject further here. SECTION VI.-On the Transformation of Variables. 61. The method of the variation of elements, theoretically considered, consists merely in a transformation of variables of a particular kind; that kind namely, which leads to a new system of differential equations belonging to the same general class as the original system. But practically, the choice of variables is determined by the well-known considerations from which the method derives its name. It is the object of the present section to consider the general class of transformations of which the method in question is a particular, and not the only useful case. 62.

And consequently if n integrals a,, a2, .. an of the original s ~ ~ ~ ~(n-1 the original system be given, which satisfy the 2 conditions [aE, a7j =0, they will continue, after a normal transformation, to satisfy the analogous conditions, so that the method of finding the remaining integrals given in Theorem VII. art. 49, will also continue to be applicable. We had an instance of this in the case of the problem of central forces (art. 27.), where the above conditions were found to subsist after the transformation from, rectangular to polar coordinates. (It will be shown presently that every transformation of coordinates is a normal transformation.) 66. It was shown in Part I. (art. 18.), that if W be any function of x,, x,2 ,.xn, Xl X2, .. xn (which may also contain t explicitly), the system of n differential equations of the second order (dW)'__dW . . .

It will appear in the sequel that the extension to the case in which P may contain t, is of importance. If the expression were not already appropriated, I should have' proposed definitively to call P the " modulus of transformation;" and I shall use 'this term provisionally in the present paper, not being able to suggest a tolerable substitute. After all, as the word "modulus "itself is used without confusion in very different senses according to the subject matter, there is, perhaps, no reason why a similar liberty should not be allowed in the use of the proposed expression.

The n equations dZ yi _dxi are then changed by (a.) and (b.) into the form (80.). -On the Transformation of Coordinates. 67. It has been seen in the preceding article, that we can always change the system of 2n equations of the first order of the form (I.), art. 64, into a system of n equations of the second order of the form (80.). In this latter form the equations of dynamics naturally present themselves. Now in the case of the dynamical equations, xi, x2, ... x, are the independent coordinates of the system (the word coordinates being taken in its most general sense), and when the equations are to be changed into the form (I.), the additional variables. dW are defined by the equations d-, =yi. In this case a transformation of coordinates, in the most general sense, consists in taking n new variables c 2, ...,, connected with the original coordinates x, ... x,, by n equations, which may also involve t explicitly.

It will be seen presently that the two expressions are equivalent when the equations connecting Xl,... xA with E,, ... i, do not involve t explicitly.] 68. Following the analogy of the dynamical equations, I shall adopt the following as the Definition of a transformation of coordinates. The original equations (I.), art. 64, having been changed into the form (80.), art. 66, let 1, E2, A,, be n new variables connected with the n variables x1, ce, ... x, by n equations, which may also involve t explicitly; and let na, ;.. . ,nn be n other new variables defined by the equations =4i(where W has been expressed in terms of El, &c., E', &c.). By means of the 2n assumed relations, the 2n original variables x, .. . xn, yl, ...y can be expressed as functions of the 2n new variables {,l ... i, ... n. Let this substitution be called a "ctransformation of coordinates." It has been seen in the preceding article that the original equations (I.) are changed by a transformation of coordinates into a system of the same form, which however cannot in general be obtained by merely expressing Z in terms of the new variables. But we are not at liberty to assume (and it is not generally true) that a change of the system (I.) into another of the same form is a normal transformation (art. 62.). It has already been stated, however (end of art. 65.), that this is true in the present case; a proposition which I proceed to establish. 69. Every transformation of coordinates is a normal transformation. To prove this theorem, we have to show that every transformation of the kind described in the last article is also of the kind defined in art. 62; in other words that it is possible to assign a function P, of 1, ... i, y1, ...y, (with or without t), such that the given relations between x, &c., 0, &c., which define the transformation of coordinates, shall be equivalent to the system of equations dP dP dyiwindi Take P= (X)y,+(X2)y2+?...?+()yn .. .

Then P is the funcd DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS OF DYNAMICS, ETC. 319 dP tion required.

(See arts. 62, 68.) This theoreni will be made more intelligible by applying it to a very simple example. Let it be proposed, then, to transform from rectangular to polar coordinates the differential equations of any dynamical problem referring to the motion of a single material point whose mass is m. 'Let x, y, z be the rectangular coordinates of m, * See note on Theorem VIII. art. 64. 320 PROFESSOR DONKIN ON THE and u, v, w the variables conjugate to them ; so that, putting T= m(x12+yJ2+z12), we dT I1tl+2 dZ have u=w-,, &c.; whencewT-(2+v2+w), and the equations of motion are x u'=-d, &c., where Z= (u2+v2+w2)-U, and U is a given function of x, y, z, with or without t. Now let r, 4, p be polar coordinates of P, so that x=r sin d cos p, y=r sin 4 sin P, z=r cos 4. Let u, v, w be the variables conjugate to r, d, p. Then the ordinary process of transformation would be as follows: (1) to express x', y', z' in terms of r, 4, p, r', 4,d I', and thus transform T into a function of the latter quantities; (2) to define u, v, w by the equations dT dT dT U=wi7, v=doW W=dp and by means of these relations to express r', 4', @' in terms of u, v, w, r, 4, , so that xi, y', z', and therefore, finally, T and Z, might be expressed as functions of the six new variables. Instead of this, let us adopt the method indicated by the theorem at the beginning of this article. We have then, for the modulus of transformation, P= (x)u+ (y)v+ (z)w, in which x, y, z are to be expressed in terms of r, 4, a; so that the proper form of P is P=ur sin 4 cos p+vr sin 4 sin p+wr cos 4, dP and the equations (corresponding to ;i= (art. 69.)) which define the new variables U, v, wL, are dP dP dP a=-T -,To W-WThese give u=sin 0(u cos p+v sin p)+w cos 4, v=r cos d(u cos 'p+ v sin p) -rw sin 4, w= -r sin d(u sin pv cos p), from which the values of u, v, w are easily obtained in terms of the six new variables. But in order to effect the transformation of T, we have only to square each side of these equations and add them, after dividing the second by r' and the third by (r sin 4)2; we thus obtain 2 VV +w2_8 +^.st~r~i2 u2+V2+W2=U2+-~j rsn02 DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS OF DYNAMICS, ETC. 321 and the transformed equations of motion are therefore mr=u, mo'=vr 2, m-P@ w(rsini)2, mu'=r-3(v2+w2 (sin 0)-2) +mdU I dr 3 2 dU dau mv'-(r sin ) w2 cos + dnWW The preceding process is not, of course, given for the sake of the result, which may easily be verified directly, but in order to illustrate the meaning of the theorem on which it depends. It is hardly necessary to add, that if the problem involved the independent rectangular coordinates of any number of material points, the transformation to polar coordinates would be effected in the same way, by merely adding to P analogous terms for each point. 71. Before proceeding further there is an important remark to be made. It has been hitherto assumed that the modulus of transformation P was a function ,of no other quantities than the 2n variables I,,, y,, ... y . and t. But if every step of the demonstrations of the theorems of transformation which have been given (art. 62, &c.) be examined, it will be seen that they continue to hold good in the following more general form. Take P 2f(E1, L Ann yl y2, *fnp,w q, r, ..., where p, q, r,... are any functions of any or at the variables, old and new, with or without t. Let the equations connecting the old and new variables be, as before, dP dP dyi din Tid ni, ..(83.) with the condition that p, q, r, ... are exemptfrom differentiation informing these equa. tions. Then take .T=dt with the following signification; (1) denotes the differential coefficient of P with respect to t, so far as t is contained explicitly, and also through the variables in p, q, r,...; that is to say, d(P) dP dP, dP, dt dpd+p P+dp q+.. (where P'=-+ -t P x'+&c. &c., but this substitution is not to be made at this stage); (2) (dl)) denotes the result of substituting in the above expression the values of y1, Y... in terms of -l, . . 4, il . . .p, p, q, r,... from (83.), so far as dt contains y5, .0.yn explicitly (i. e. not involved in p, q, r, ...). Lastly, take 'D (Z)+-, where (Z) denotes the result of substituting in Z the values of the old variables as 322 PROFESSOR DONKIN ON THE given in terms of p, ... ,...p, q, r, ... from (82.). We shall then have I, W<) 77, = _ de>, . . . . . . . (84.) where 'D is in general a function of h n, 4ns p1) q* an ) ?,1 pf, *. q, r',.. and t; and the differentiations with respect to an i are performed only so far as those variables appear explicitly in (. But after these deff~rentiations, we may introduce the actual values of p, ... ... in terms of the variables and their differential coefficients. It is obvious that the original variables will not, in general, have been eliminated froin the system (84.); but of course the elimination may be afterwards cornpleted*. Similar considerations apply to that particular case of transformation which we have called a transformation of coordinates (art. 68.). We hav e then P (X1)y + ... + (xn)yn, and the relations connecting xl c.. xn with 0, ... En may contain p, p, r, ...; so that (xl), &c. are functions of P, q, r, ... as well as of l, ... We might have deduced the preceding conclusions from the following simple consideration. Since p, q, r, ... are actually functions of t, though unknown functions, we may imagine them to be known, and to be expressed explicitly in terms of t; and then the case resolves itself into that of art. 62, &c., so far as the demonstration is concerned. But as a doubt might possibly have arisen whether any fallacy was involved in the circumstance that p, q, r, ... involve (when supposed to be expressed in terms of t) the arbitrary constants of the problem itself, it seemed best to refer to the original reasoning; the most important part of which is that contained (mutatis mutandis) in art. 6. (For the " mutanda" see the beginning of art. 63.) It is then apparent that this circumstance is perfectly immaterial with reference to the conclusions in question, though it may be important in other points of view. 72. This being premised, we will proceed to an example of transformation more interesting than the former, namely, the Transformation fromfixed to moving axes of coordinates. Let x, y, z, u, v, w have the same signification as in art. 70, and let xfy, z, u, v, w be the new variables, where x, y, z are rectangular coordinates, referring to a system of moving axes of which the origin always coincides with that of the original fixed axes of x, y, z.

The modulus of transformation P is found (art. 69.) by substituting for the variables x, y, z in the expression xu+yv+zw, their values in terms of x, y, z; we have therefore P= (kOX+1y+2z)u+ ((hOX+P(hy+Ph2Z)V+ (vOX+v2y+V2z)w; and then the three equations dP dP dP -X=u, T =V, TZ=W, give U =:Ou+P(OV+yOw fU = ?X.oU+ XIV+ KW2 v =Xu++P(v+vlw , whence v =POU+PIv+(P2w . . . . . .

On the principles of the integration of this, and of transformled systems in general, I shall make some remarks hereafter, For the present, the following may be observed. If, in the transformation of the last article, we suppose the motion of the new axes given, then xn, &c., and therefore also wo, W11 W2 are given explicit functions of t. But if the motion of the new axes is only given by connecting it with the motion of the point m itself, then the above quantities are given functions of the variables and their differential coefficients. The most interesting case of the latter kind is that in which the motion of the new axes is assumed to satisfy the equations X y z which express the condition that the instantaneous axis of rotation (of the moving axes) always coincides with the radius vector of the moving point m The radius vector traces, in fixed space, a certain conical surface. It also traces, with reference to the moving axes, another conical surface; and we might always assume as one of the conditions defining their motion, that this latter should be any proposed surface; that is, we might assume that the new coordinates x, y, z should always satisfy the equation p(x,y, z)=0, p representing any given homogeneous func4 tion. If to this last assumption we add the two conditions expressed by the formula (Z.), we further assume that the conical surface traced by the radius vector with reference to the moving axes, rolls upon that traced in fxed space. Suppose, for example, we assume for the equation ,(x,y, x)=O, simply z=O. This, with the conditions (Z.), will express that the radius vector is always in the plane of my, and that this plane rolls upon the conical surface traced by the radius vector in fixed space. We may then say that the plane of xy is the " plane of the orbit," and that the axes of xy, or any lines fixed with reference to them in their plane, are "fixed in the plane of the orbitt ."* See JACOBI'S first letter to Professor HANSEN (CRELLE'S Journal, vol. xlii. p. 21). This letter appears to refer to some unpublished (?) results of Professor HANSEN, which may possibly be similar to those of this article. t The student of elementary treatises is, I. believe, always left to find out for himself what this expression means, or ought to mean. DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS OF DYNAMICS, ETC. 325 Now since we are supposing the equations to belong to a dynamical problem, we have u=mx', v=my', w=mz', and if we substitute on each side of these equations the values derived from (85.), art. 72, we find easily u=m( '+Wvzl-W2y), v=m(y'+x2x-c.z), W=m(Z'+cOy-cx), relations which are true on all suppositions as to the motion of the axes; but the assumptions (Z.) reduce them to The further assumption z=0, which involves z'=O, gives w=O, and also (by the equations (Z.)) w,=2-O. Thus the equations (86.) are reduced to dZ a dZ d dx dZ ,__ dZ Td dy dZ dZ ?=gt, 0==+WJU-c0V, where in dZ ard-, z and w are to be put =0 after the differentiation. It is to be observed also, that the values of u, v, w above given reduce the three first of the dZ dZ dZ equations (86.) to the form u=m ?d v=m d w m T1 from which it is evident that Z_ I (U 2+v 2+W2)-U 2m where U is the original force-function, expressed in terms of the new variables. This depends only upon the conditions (Z'.); but in the case now considered we have also w-=0. Let the origin of coordinates be the Sun; m a planet disturbed by another planet ml whose original coordinates are x, y,, z,, and new coordinates x,, y,, z,; also let x +y2+z2=r,2 x2+y2+z2=r2 xx2+ 2+z2=-2, x2+y2+Z2=r2, and (x x)2+(yj y)2 + (Z' Z) 2 t2 we have evidently r2=r? r2=r2, and (X, X)2 + (y, .) 2 + (a _ Z)2 = (XI X)2 + (.y _y)2 + (Z %2 and xx, +yy,+zz1,=xx+yy1+zz1 We have then originally U=T~+Mmm1 XI 7~ where pj=m+mass of Sun; and it is evident that this expression preserves the same form when expressed in terms of the new coordinates, and also (which is essential to the validity of what follows), that tM, &c. are the same whether the differentiation 2 x2 326 PROFESSOR DONKIN ON THE be performed before or after the substitution for x, y,, z,, in terms of x,, y,, z,. If then we put z=0 and R~~m1(4 x+ YYi) we shall have, from the fourth and fifth of the transformed differential equations*, 4 a dR ZH + do p . . . . . ~~~(87p) y=_P-y+dR from which it is evident, that, assuming the motion of 1n, to be known relatively to the new axes, the variations of the four elements of the orbit of m which determine the dimensions of the orbit, its position relatively to linesjfxed in its own plane, and the time of perihelion passage, will be expressed in terms of the differential coefficients of R in the same way as if the plane of the orbit were fixed. But the motion of the node of the orbit upon the fixed plane of xy, and its inclination to that plane, must be determined by means of the last of the differential equations, as follows: that equation gives MU-ZV =(ddZ\ -__ O) or if we put -i2 for the tertn multiplied by mm, in the value of U given above, dz arid z is to be put =0 after the differentiation, which reduces the above to. Let 2+N=O2, so that a is the angular velocity of the plane of the orbit about the radius vector; then (observing that u=mx', &c.) we have a ovo W0-c X y r-m(xy'x Y) whence VWO-c(uw1= yI(y -Y) r / ~a tW ~ae and therefore m6=V-2 e2)jd> which gives a in terms of the four elements referred to above, and of t. And if we put i for the inclination of the orbit to the plane of xy, v for the longitude of the node* These equations (87.) have been obtained in a different way by Mr. BRoNwIN. Camb. Math. Journ. vol. iv. p. 245. t See below, art. 80.

The actual value of (d) is mm z, (r-3), which (since z, r1, &c. are supposed given in terms of t) may be expressed in terms of the four elements first mentioned, and t. I propose to consider the transformation of the differential equations of the planetary theory in a more general manner in the following section. At present I shall add some remarks on normal transformations in general. 74. Theorem. If dZ dZ(s. i= y(89.) be a system of 2n simultaneous differential equations, where Z==f(XI,y1, X2,y2, ... p, q, r, ..., 1). andp, q,r,... are also explicit functions of xF, &c.,y1&c. and t, but are exemptfrom d.Jfrrentiation in taking the differential coefficients dZ dZ; and if these equations be transdxi dyi formed by a normal substitution of new variables E1, &c., p1, &c. (art. 62, equation (73.)), then the transformed equations are, as in art. 64, d? dZ dT dZ {i= d d -' Hi-gdi in which Z is expressed in terms of ', &c., 8, &c., but the differentiations with respect to Ei, ni are performed before the substitution of these variables in p, q, r, &c.; in other words, p, q, r, ... are still to be exempt from differentiation in forming the differential equations. This may be proved simply by repeating the reasoning of art. 64. The only difference is, that in the term jdZ dxj dZ dy} Idxj dnj dyj dn, J the differential coefficients are now taken only so far as Z contains x1, y inde328 PROFESSOR DONKIN ON THE pendently of p, q, r, &c.; and therefore the term represents the differential coefficient dZ taken so far as Z contains ni independently of p, q, r, &c. The same reasoning applies to the corresponding term in the value of h. The theorem is thus established. It is evident that it may be combined with that given in art. 71, where other functions analogous to p, q, r, ... are introduced by the modulus of transformation P. If we call the form of the system of differential equations (89.) canonical when the differentiations of Z with respect to x1, &c., y1, &c. are total, we might call it pseudocanonical when Z contains functions of x,, &c., y,, which are exempt from differentiation in forming the differential equations. In like manner, if we call a transformation of variables normal, when the differentiations of the modulus P (equations (73.),. art. 62.) with respect to El, &c., y,, &c. are total (as in art. 62.), we might call the transformation pseudo-normal when P contains functions of the variables which are exempt from differentiation in forming the equations of transformation (as in art. 71.). Adopting these designations, we may enunciate the following general theorem of transformation Theorem X.-If a pseudo-canonical system be transformed by a normal or pseudonormal substitution, the transformed equations are also pseudo-canonical, and may be formed by the rules applying to normal transformations of canonical systems, provided that the functions which are originally exempt from differentiation with respect to the variables, be continued exempt to the end of the process; but if such functions occur in the modulus of transformation P. they are subject to total differentiation d.,P with respect to t in forming the term d-i (See art. 71.) [With respect to this theorem there is one important remark to be made. If u, v be any two functions of xl, &c., yi, &c. (with or without p, q, r, ... and t), the equation du d dudv dudA du ) ) Gladys (ar Dali dye tvd~tit, 63.) is now only true on condition that the substitution of the actual values of p, q, r, in terms of the variables be not performed till after all the differentiations.] 75. The theory of the variation of elements affords an interesting example of the theorem given in the last article. Consider the following system of differential equations, ,dZ dt , dZ df2 i= dyi +i i (90.) dZ dZ where in d. _the differentiations are total, but Q is supposed to contain functions of xl, &c., y &c. which are exempt from differentiation in forming the above equations. The system dZ , dZ Z~~~~i= T.i 7-dz DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS OF I)YNA.MICS, ETFC. 329 is canonical. Let us assume then that a complete set of normal integrals a,, ...a, bl 'v.. bn of this latter system is known, so that we have ai=Pi(xi, &'c*, yi, &c-, t), bi=%i(xj, &c., yl, &c*, t). The assumption of these last equations to represent the solution of the complete system (90.) is simply a transformation of variables, (a,, &c., b1, &c. being the new variables); it is also a normal transformation, since the equations connecting the new and old variables may be put in the form (see Theorem VII. art. 49, and art. 62.) dX dX =Y, ~-=b Txi, da i, where X (the modulus of transformation) is a function of xi, ... x . ax, t. The dX function T of art. 62 is now obtained by expressing Wt in terms of a,, ... bj, .... dX but since Z is expressed in terms of xi, &c., yi, &c., it follows that when Z is expressed in terms of the new variables a,, &c., b1, &c., it becomes identical with T. Now if the process of art. 63 be followed, mutatis mutandis, it will be seen that in the present case we obtain d1P dZ {du i? aiT Wb-db-JI(y db}' in which expression the first two terms destroy one another, and the remaining term is evidently the differential coefficient of Q with respect to bi, taken so far as Q contains bi independently of those functions which were exempt from differentiation in forming the original differential equations (90.). Similar reasoning applies to the expression for bl. As this result will be useful, I shall enunciate it separately as Theorem XI.-If the original system of differential equations be formed by treating certain functions, p, q, r, ..., contained in the disturbing function Q, as exempt from differentiation with respect to xl, &c., y1,&c., the equations which determine the variations of any set of normal elements a,, &c., b,, &c. dfl d a,= -db 6, dai on condition that p, q, r, ... be treated, i n forming these equations, as exempt from differentiation with respect to a,, &c., b1, &c. [It is important to recollect, that after these equations are formed, p, q, r, &c. are to be expressed in terms of a,, &c., bl, &c., and in the integration of the system a1, &c., b1, &c. are to be treated indiscriminately as variables, whether they originally entered through p, q, r, ... or not]. The Theorem XI. may also be immediately obtained from the general equations (E.) of art. 52 (in which it is to be rememxbered that Z includes the disturbing 330 PROFESSOR DONKIN ON THE function). The above method of deducing it is given as an additional illustration of the general theory of transformation. If, instead of the normal elements al, &c., bl, &c., we employ any other elements, c1, c2, &c., which can be expressed as functions of the former, the formula (69.) of art. 54 will still be applicable, with the condition that p, q, r, &c. are exempt from differentiation with respect to cl, c2, &c. SECTION VII.-On the D fferential Equations of the Planetary Theory. 76. The differential equations which determine the motions of a system of mutually attracting material points relatively to one of them, do not, as is well known, naturally present themselves under the canonical form (I.), art. 49. It is possible indeed to reduce them, by different artifices, to that form; but it seems doubtful whether any practical advantage is gained by doing so. When the ordinary method is followed in the case of a planetary system referred to the sun, there is a distinct disturbing function for each planet; but it is easily seen that the usual expressions fob' the variations of the elements hold good, not merely for each planet on the hypothesis that the motions of the rest are known, but as a complete and rigorous set of simultaneous differential equations involving all the elements of all the orbits, and their differential coefficients with respect to t (and containing of course also t ex.plicitly). It does not appear that we are practically farther from the attainment of the rigorous integration of this system, than we should be if it had the canonicalform, as it might be made to have if it were derived from an original system of that form; and so fat as the development of the disturbing functions is concerned, the most troublesome part of them, which is that depending on the mutual distances of the planets, is not likely to be got rid of by any conceivable artifice. However this may be, all that I propose to do in the present section is to take the original differential equations in their ordinary form referred to rectangular axes passing through the sun and parallel to fixed directions, and then to exhibit in a general manner the effect of a transformation to new rectangular axes, still passing through the sun, but changing their directions in space according to any arbitrary law. 77. Let M be the mass of the suD, and m, O mill &c., the masses of the planets; and put M+m=Pi, M+m,=,, M+m,,=l PJ ... M+m(,)=p((). And, referred to the original axes, let x, y, z be the coordinates of n, x,, y,, z, of m,, ..., xt, y(,), zoo of n(i. Also let R, R., ... R(Y) have their usual significations, so that m(i) ; m( )(XX() + yy(i) + zz(j)) ((X(t) X)2 + (y(i) _ Y)2 + (Z(i) _z)2)( W+~)+zi) the summation extending to all the planets except m. Then if we put xU(+y ()+ -(4)=rj), the original differential equations of the second otrder are such as / f) dR .Ji Let u,., V(j), wli1.be thc variables onjiua to DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS OF DYNAMICS, ETC. 331 x(t), yTO),Z(). Then instead of the original system of differential equations of the second order, we have the following system of the first order: I dZ(i) * dZ(j) I dZ& X(a) , Yti),dv ? d ki1 d(tj) + ' V~i)+ d 0,? Wf)+dZ(i)=O in which Z(U)=4-(iu)+vi)+wi)) _M(i) R These equations are not of the canonical form, because R(e) is not the same for all the planets. But it is easy to put them in the pseudo-canonical form (art. 74.), a process which is not necessary, but saves trouble by bringing them under the operation of the general rules of transformation established in former articles. In fact, if we take Z U(i) + VIr +,WW m _mpi,l(i)) 2m(i) r(i) Q l? {X(i)X(j) + (i)yu() + Z(i)z(j) X(i)X(j) + y(i)y(j) + Z(i)z(j) (i) (3) \ r r( 2 U) \ ((X(i)-X(J))2 + (Y(i) _ Ye.())2 + (Z(.)-Z())2) where the summation in the first term extends to all the planets, and in the second to all their binary combinations, and a horizontal line placed over any letter indicates exemptionfrom dijftrentiation, we shall have dZ dQ dZ dQ Xi)= d+7 U(i)9dx 1*) with similar equations for y(i), z(i)) si), w(i). [The terms &c. are only written for the sake of uniformity, being really =0, since Q does not involve u(i), Vf) w(0).] In these equations Z and Q are the samefor the whole system, and the differentiations of Z are total; but those of Q are restricted to the quantities not marked by the dQ. dR(s) horizontal line, so that is really the same thing as -m(i)dX. 78. Let us now refer the whole system to new (moving) rectangular axes, whose position at any instant with respect to the original axes is defined, as in art. 72, by the variable direction-cosines Xo &c. Let x(j) y(), Z(f) be the new coordinates, and U(j), V(j) W(i) the new variables conjugate to them. The transformation will be effected, as in art. 72, by taking for the modulus P= ((Xox(i) +Xly(i)+X2Z(i))U(i)+ (POX(i) + JIY(i) +jP2Z(i)) V(i)-+ (0X(OX(i) +IY(i) + V2z(i)W(i), and the result will be as follows: put cc-c + d (Z. ) YFiv., i)) I 1 2 (t + 2.iIi t 332 PROFESSOR DONKIN ON THE (where Q is expressed in terms of the new variables, and w, wi, w2 (the angular velocities of the moving system of axes about the three moving axes themselves) are marked with the horizontal line to show that these quantities are exempt from differentiation in forming the following system of differential equations, though they may be functions of the variables); then the system (91.) is transformed into dZ dt , dZ d. Xki) dUid (i)= 8,d~,dx(i, .s. (92.) with similar equations for y, &c. In these equations Z is to be expressed in terms of the new variables; and it is evident from the original form of Z and Q, that when so expressed, these two quantities are the same functions of the new variables that they were of the old, and involve (see art. 74.) the quantities exempt from differentiation in the same way*. Thus the transformed system (92.) contains no ternms explicitly depending upon the motion of the axes, except those introduced by the three terms multiplied by aw, , w, in the value of Ql given above; and the addition of these terins constitutes the only difference between the form of the old and of the new system. 79. We may now apply the method of the variation of elements to the system (92.) as follows The system obtained by omitting the disturbing function (2, namely, , dZ , dZ , dZ d(i) dZ a~))?dO f.(93.) U~~+~jYO = V~+ dyU70 (wj 1)9 (+dz V, k'dzJ, (+dz, =0 is canonical, and consists simply of the aggregate of the equations representing, for each planet, undisturbed elliptic motion about the sun (relatively to the new axes of coordinates). The integrals of these equations may therefore be expressed in any of the usual forms. We will suppose that the elements chosen are a, e, or, (E), 5, Y, with significations corresponding to those given to the same symbols in art. 55. These letters unaccented will apply to the planet tn, and a,, e,, &c., a,,, e,,, &c., a(,), e(i), &c., to the planets M,, inn m(t), &c. The defnitions of the elements a, e, r, &c. are their expressions in terms of the six * Since the direction cosines X0, &c. are exempt from differentiation in forming the equations connecting the old and new variables from the modulus P, they continue exempt throughout. (Theorem X. art. 74.) Hence we have ~,? xxJ + zz,=(X0X+XIy+X2Z)(X0aX,+Xly,+X2Z,)+&&c.=x', +yj +Za and similarly for the rest. t z= z (U ?v2+w r ) the summation extending to all the planets. DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS OF DYNAMICS, ETC. 333 variables x, y, x, u, v, w *, and t, and the same expressions continue to be their definitions when they become the variable elements of the disturbed motion. Now the general formulae for the variations of the set of elements here chosen have already been given in art. 55; for it is evident that the process in the present case would merely be a repetition, for each planet, of the process there employed. Here however we are to use in every case the disturbing function i given in art. 78; but if we observe the effect of the marks of exemption, it will be evident that, for the planet m, the only effective part of ?1 is C0(zv-yw) +-1(xw-zu) +32(yu-xv) -mR ; and similarly the effective part of E2 for any other planet will be given by suffixing the corresponding number of accents to x, y,, u, U V, WI m, R. Now if we put A0, Al, A2 for the terms multiplied respectively by wx, w,, wS in the above expression, we have, by the definitions of the elements, (A +AI+eA2 22) __ A2= -m,/pa(I -e2). cos t, Al=manpva(l e2) . cos v sine AO= -mVpa(l -e2). sin v sine, so that the disturbing function, so far as m is concerned, becomes -m, { R+ \7 a(1 -.e2). (-W sin v sin i-a, cos v sin i +)2 cos s)}.(94.) Consequently, since the expressions in art. 55 were obtained by taking -mR for the disturbing function, we have merely to add to them the additional terms derived from the part added to R in (94.). Performing the differentiations, and omitting afterwards the symbols of exemption over WIv, 6, W2 which cease to be of any use, we obtain, after obvious reductions, the following simple results: if dg, d &c. represent those parts of the differential coefficients of a, e, &c., with respect to t, which depend upon the motion of the axes of coordinates, then dt 2 t 3(e), as=o ()-tan 2(a,, cos vx0 sin v) S Tt-s(co cos +w,1 sin v) dgt=-a2+ cot i (w0 sin v-1cosv)-| where it is evident that we may write s instead of (&) (see art. 55.). $ Not their expressions in terms of x, y z, x y', z'; for though these are equivalent in the undisturbed equations, they are not here equivalent in the disturbed equations, and therefore the general theory, which assumes the former mode of expression, is not here applicable to the latter. 2 Y2 334 PROFESSOR DONKIN ON THE The complete variations of the elements are then found by adding to the terms just written the expressions given in art. 25. It is easily seen that the expressions (95.) might have been deduced from geomnetrical considerations alone, if we had been at liberty to assume beforehand that the mechanical and geometrical parts of the variations might be calculated separately; the former as if the axes were at rest, and the latter as if there were no disturbing forces. It would not, I believe, be difficult to establish by a priori and simple reasoning the validity of such an assumption, and then the above results would only serve as a verification of the method which has been employed to obtain themn. 80. In order however that no obscurity may rest upon the interpretation of the formulae obtained in the last articles, it is necessary to consider the physical (or rather geometrical) meaning of the elements a, e, &c., which we have so far only defined by means of their expressions in terms of the variables x, y, z, u, &c., and to ascertain what relation they bear to the elements similarly defined by means of the original variables x, y, &c., which refer to axes whose directions are invariable. The relations between the variables ((85.), art. 72.) give immediately t2 + 2= 2X2 +y2+ Z2 x2 +y2+ z =2y?z2 u +v2+w2112?v2+w2 ux+vy+zw=ux+vy+zw; and if we put yw-Zv=eA, zu-.xw=B, xv-yu=C yw-zv=A, zu-xw=B, xv-yu=C, we find, by virtue of the relations P1V2-1w2=X?0, &c., the following equations: A=o0A+po0B+YoC B=X1A+pB+v1C C=x2A + Pi2B +V2C and A2+B2+ C2=A2+B2+C2. Now A(=yw-zv=m(yz'-zy')) is the projection on the plane of yz of the areat velocity of m (relative to fixed space) multiplied by the mass, and B, C have analogous meanings; hence it is evident from the above equations that A, B, C are the projections on the three moving coordinate planes of yz, zx, xy of the absolute areal velocity of m relative to fixed spface, multiplied by the mass. (The projections of the areal velocity relative to the moving axes would be yz'-zy', &c., which are not proportional toyw-zv, &c., since u, v, w are not the same as mx', my', mz', except on a particular hypothesis as to the motion of the axes. See art. 73.). Inasmuch as the definitions of the elements a, e, ? involve the variables only in the forms x2+y2+z2, u2+v2+w2, A, B, C, it follows that these three elements are respectively the semniaxes, eccentricity, and inclination to the plane of xy, of the absolute osculating ellipse of the orbit infixed space. Thus the instantaneous ellipse, relatively to the moving axes, is of the same dimensions and inl the same p~lane as the true DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS OF DYNAMICS, ETC. 335 osculating ellipse; and it only remains to show that it coincides with the latter in position, for which purpose we must prove that it touches the true orbit. (It does not in general touch the relative orbit, because mx', my', mz' are not in general the same functions of the elements and t that u, v, w are.) 81. If we suppose the coordinates x, y, z of m expressed in terms of the elements dx a, e, &c. and t, and denote by at, &c. their differential coefficients taken so far as t dx dy dz appears explicitly in these expressions, then dt -d are proportional to the direction cosines, relatively to the axes of x, y, z, of the tangent to the (relative) instantaneous ellipse. And therefore the direction cosines of this same tangent referred to the fixed axes of x, y, z, are proportional respectively to + ? 2dx+ dy+ dz d+ dY+dzx ?dt+ dt+ 2 t tp tl> Tn odg dtv Tt' On the other hand, the direction cosines of the tangent to the absolute instantaneous ellipse, referred to the fixed axes, are proportional to A, dy dz (the differential dt dt dt coefficients of x, y, z, taken so far as t appears explicitly in the expressions for those variables in terms of the elements of the absolute ellipse). The identity of the two tangents will therefore be established, if we can -show that dx dx dy d d dt+ d~t W~t & dx . Now Tt is that part of x' which does not depend upon the disturbing function; i. e. (equations (92.), art. 78.) we have identically dx dZ dy dZ dz dZ. dt du dtdWV dt dw d I k * dx~~A dZ dy dZ AdZ_ and, in like manner, d d Z __ dt du dtdTv dt dw where Z is the same as before, but expressed in ter ms of x, y, Z, u, v, W, instead of x-y, z, u, v, w. Now let the latter set of variables be expressed in terms of the former by the fornulve of art. 72, and we have dZ dZ du dZ dv dZ dw du du du+ dv du+dw du but ~~~~du dv dwat but d-u_4 du_4 dU=42 ((85.), art. 72.), &c., and therefore dx dxdy+ dzt as was to be proved. 82. It follows, then, that the mode of treating the problem adopted in the preceding articles is equivalent to representing the motion of each planet by means of the true osculating ellipse of its actual orbit (relatively to the sun) in fixed space. 336 PROFESSOR DONKIN ON THE The definitions of all the elements (relative to the moving axes) in terms of the six new variables xy, z, u, v, w, have the same form as those of the corresponding elements (relative to the fixed axes) in terms of x, y, z, ui, v, w. The two relative elements a, e are the same as the corresponding absolute elements; i is the inclination of the plane of the ellipse to the moving plane of xy, and v the longitude of the node reckoned from the axis of x; and since the place of the body in the ellipse is evidently the same, the relations between the remaining elements v and (@) (or 6) and the corresponding absolute elements are purely geometrical. Comparing these results with those of art. 79, we see that the independence of the foirmulae for the mechanical and geometrical variations of the elements of the true osculating ellipse is completely established. 83. In all that precedes, the three variables WI, W 2 (the angular velocities of the system of moving axes about the axes themselves) are entirely arbitrary; they may tbe either explicit functions of t, involving only determinate constants, or they may depend in any way upon the relative or absolute elements of the orbits of any or all the planets, and their differential coefficients with respect to t. In the case in which the expressions for o, 1 t involve only the relative elements, when these expressions are introduced in the formulae (95.), art. 79, and these formulae completed by the addition of the terms in art. 55, and when the corresponding sets of equations are formed for each planet, we obtain a set of simultaneous differential equations involving all the elements of all the orbits, and their differential coefficients with respect to t. The integration of these equations would determine all the elements aIs functions of t, and thus the motion of all the planets, relatively to the axes of coordinates, would be known. Lastly, the motion of the whole system, relatively to fixed space, would be found by integrating the system of equations L'=wo cos X-, 1sin X N'sinL-& sin X+w1 cos X (96.) X'-N' cosL J where woI wjn w2 are now given functions of t, and L is the inclination of the plane of xy to that of xy, N is the longitude of the ascending * node of the plane of xi, reckoned fiom the axis of x, and X is the longitude of the axis of x, reckoned upon the plane of xy,from the node, in the direction of positive rotation. In the case in which W WI, x2 cannot be expressed in terms of the relative elements, the integrations which determine the relative motion of the system cannot be separated from those which determine the position of the axes in fixed space; but the equations (96.) must be considered simultaneously with the other differential equations of the problem. * Ascending relatively to a positive rotation, i. e. from x to y. DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS OF DYNAMICS, ETC. 337 Application to the Problem of Three Bodies. 84. I propose to exemplify the preceding principles by applying them to the transformation of the equations which determine the motion of three mutually attracting bodies, considered as material points. Let them be called the sun and two planets, and let the origin of coordinates be placed at the sun, and the notation be the same as in arts. 77-79, so that M, m, mn are the three masses, M+m=p, M+m,=!,, &c. Let the elements be chosen as in art. 55, and longitudes be measured, as before, along the plane of xy (front the axis of x) as far as the node, and then along the plane of the orbit. Putting for convenience mR=fl, m,R,=f2,, we have n= =mrn, { (r2+r22rr, cos X) rr2 cos C} Q.-=rnm,{ (r2+r,2-11 2rr, cos X)r'cos X}) where X is the angle between the two radii vectores. Let I be the mutual inclination of the planes of the two orbits, and let the angular distances, on the planes of the orbits, between their ascending nodes on the plane of xy and their line of intersection, be respectively v, v,,; so that a-v-v, 0,-uv -, are the angular 'distances of the two radii vectores from the line of intersection (which we may call, simply, the line of nodes).

Hitherto we have assumed nothing concerning the motion of the axes of coordinates. Let us now however take as a first assumption that the plane of xy shall always pass through the line of nodes. This implies the conditions* v,=v, v=O, vI=0 and consequently I=.,-i. Introducing these conditions in the expressions at the end of the last article, and * The legitimacy of the following processes will be apparent to the reader who shall have followed the general reasoning of former articles, though probably not to others. In either case it may be useful here briefly to recapitulate the principles now to be applied. The results of art. 79, and in particular the expressions (94.), (95.), were established independently of any assumption as to the values of tool W, w2, which are perfectly arbitrary. We are therefore at liberty to assume that wo, WI, wc 2 are such functions of t that any three functions of the variables shall constantly =0. Thus the first assumption made in the text is that v,-v shall constantly =0. But since such assumptions may cause (as in this case) certain elements to disappear from the expression of A, it is necessary to perform the differentiations of a with respect to such elements first; the differential coefficients may or may not vanish, on afterwards introducing the assumptions; if not, we find expressions for them in terms of differential coefficients with respect to other elements which do not disappear; so that instead of differentiations which ought to be performed before the assumed conditions are introduced, we have finally only such as may be performed afterwards. The expression " disappear" does not, it must be observed, necessarily mean the same as "vanish." Thus the condition Y,-v 0, causes v and vY both to disappear from i r, but does not of course imply that they both vanish. DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS OF DYNAMICS, ETC. 339 d7 observing that -do-=EQ, &c. (see equation (99.)), we have evidently (ndv\ dt di ds -Qy9EP( du du and it only remains to find the values of (k) &c., namely, the values of dy &c., which correspond to the assumed conditions v,-v=0, v=v,=0. Now in any spherical triangle of which a, b, c are the sides, and A, B, C the opposite angles, if a be considered as a function of c, A, B, by virtue of the equation cot a sin c= cot A sin B+ cos c cos B, we have by differentiation da (sin a2cot a cot c+ cos B) = cos a sin a cot c+ (1 (cos a)2) cos B cos B + cos a cot C sin B da (sin a 2 sin B sin a sin B dA krsin A sin c sin C da (sin a)2 cot A cos B + cot c(sin a)2 sinBB sin a cot C; dB siC and if the sides of the triangle be indefinitely diminished, these expressions become, in the limit, da sin (B?

But the angular velocities wo, w w2 are no longer wholly arbitrary since we have made one assumption concerning the motion of the axes, which implies one relation between these quantities and the elements. In order to determine wo, , w2 completely, it will be necessary to make two more assumptions; but first we will investigate the relation already implied. 86. The complete expressions for V', V, obtained in the way mentioned in the last article, from arts. 55 and 79, may be written in the following form: put for brevity mN/a ~(ie2) =p, mV-,( pi and put Ada-9 for n, and p,1a,for n,; then a'=~ .1 gp+ cot i.(w sin vw1 cos P) 2 / I df~~~~~~~~, }.. ~~~~~~(1,02.) p, sin j, d, vo +1 Acot i(0 sin -JcosV,-2 and if the latter equation be subtracted from the forger, and the conditions dA2 d&Ald&2 df2, di 4' d; dl be introduced, the result is easily found to be sins dQ sins dQ (WS sin Y-wl cos v)sin I= Pi dI + p d .(103.) This is the -relation between w0, w, and the elements and t, implied by the one assumed condition that the plane of xy passes through the line of nodes. -rThe angular velocity a2 of the system of axes about the axis of z, is so far left, as it evidently ought to be, perfectly arbitrary. Q and Q. are now functions of the following elements* onlyl a, e, (s), n, a,, e,, (a,), ' I P. And we now have COSX= Cos (a-V) Cos (K,-V) + sin (d-Y) sin (d, -) cos I. 87. The complete expression for :', derived from arts. F55 and 79, is easily put in the form i=--p s { +(1-cos i)EQ }-(cWocos VY+Jsin v), andl on introducing the assumptions of the preceding articles, this will be found to become, after simple reductions, p sin 1.5= -(cos I.EQ+EQ)-(a0coS v+wsin v)p sin I; * On the difference between (E) and ? see above, art. 55. We cannot strictly call &2 a function of a and ?. DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS OF DYNAMICS, ETC.341 similarly, we find plsin I.s=cos I.E Q,+EQ1-(w,0cos v+wsin P)psin I; and since I'=/-/', we obtain from these pp.sin I.I'=p(cos I. EQ,+EQ,)+p (cosI.EQ+E1Q), . . . (104.) an equation which may be transformed as follows:-since Ta=0, ad =0 (art. 79), we find from art. 55, 1=-W+d=EQ, and similarly p= E Q,, whence it is easily seen that the above equation may be written in the form (pp4 cos 1)'+pEQ,+pEQ=0. . . . . . . . (105.) If we investigate, from the above expressions for a' and 4, the values of (p sin s)' and (p, sin i)', we find sin I.(p sin *)'= (cos i,.E+cos s.E,)Q-p cos I sin I(w,0cos P+w, sin v), sin I.(psin 5,)1= (cos *.E,+cos *,.E)Q,-p1 cos *,sin I (w0cos v+x, sin v), and, adding these equations, sin I.(p sin s+psin s1)'= (cos i,.E+cos i.E1)(Q,Q) (p cos +p, cos i,)sin I. (cwcos v+w, sin P). . . (106.) With respect to this equation and (103.), it may be observed that z0cosv+-, sin V is evidently the angular velocity of the plane of xy about the line of nodes, and cWcos V-reo sin v is the angular velocity of the same plane about a line in itself perpendicular to the line of nodes; or, which comes to the same thing, the angular velocity of the line of nodes itself in fixed space, estimated perpendicularly to the plane of xy. 88. The position of the plane of xy at any instant has been so far left arbitrary, except that it has been subjected to the condition of passing through the line of nodes. As a further assumption, that which mrost naturally presents itself is, that the plane of xy should always coincide with the principal plane. By the principal plane I mean, of course, that on which at any instant the sum of the projections of the areal velocities (multiplied by the masses) of the two planets about the sun, is a maximum; it evidently always passes throughi the line of nodes, and would be the invariable plane if the disturbing functions vanished. To determine the position of this plane we have (see art. 80.) to express the condition that s and A, are always so taken, subject to the equation -s_=1, that the expression mVc`a( 1e2) . cos 5+mV'/fp,a(l e12). cos sX shall be a maximnurn. We will put a for the value of this expression, so that using p and p1 with the same meaning as before (see art. 86.), we have o'=p cos s+p,cos .,, 2 z2 342 PROFESSOR DONKIN ON THE and the required condition of a maximum will evidently be p sin i+psin ,=O *;.(107.) adding the squares of these expressions, we obtain G2 =P2 +p2 +2ppcos I, .(1 08.) which determines the actual value of oT; moreover we have sins Sin sinll (109.) Pi P C * * and it is easy to find ocosI=p p+cosI .(110.) cos *,-p,+p cos I so that a-, sin *, sin *,, cos *, cos *, are all simply expressible in terms of p, p, and I. The variation of a is easily found by means of the equation (105.), which gives an' (pJE,-p E) (Q. -(Q).111.) The equation (103.) now gives (see (109.)) -(w, cos vo sin Y) = d (I 12.) and from (106.) we obtain a2 sin (wocos v+,sin v){ (p pcos I)E,+(p,+p cos E}(Q-Q). ( 13.) The two last equations determine the motion of the principal plane in space, irrespectively of any arbitrary sliding motion which we may attribute to it in its own plane. For they give the angular velocities with which it is at any instant moving about two lines at right angles to one another in its own plane (see the end of art. 87.). They may be put in another form as follows :-the actual value of fQ.f is r r\ mmn t 2rJCos G where cos X has the value given above (end of art. 86.); and if the operations indicated be actually performed, observing that Er=0, EEr=0, &c., and that dCos X& E cosy, dO c. the results will be found to be o-(w cosyv-.ssin v)=mmsinI. ( ) si )sin (,-i) e(w0cos v +&l sin v) = mm, sin I . (--) X (p cos (0-y)sin (0,-v) +p sin (O-Y)cos(dO,-)). Here O-v, 0 -v represent, it will be remembered. the angular distances of the planets fromn the line of nodes. We will assume for the present the condition a)2=0, so that the plane of xy may have no sliding motion, but roll upon the conical surface to which it is always a tan* Referring to the arrangement supposed in the diagram, it will be seen that & becomes negative in the case now considered. DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS OF DYNAMICS, ETC. 343 gent plane. If, then, we call w the actual angular velocity of the principal plane about its instantaneous axis of rotation, so that G=N/4+Z22 and put j for the angle between the line of nodes and the instantaneous axis (which is the line in which the principal plane is intersected by its consecutive), we shall have W0cos Va-Z sin P= coSj and 1 cos v w0 sin Y=c sinJ; and the above equations give af cotj=p cot (d-v) +pcot (d, v), a result which may also be put in the form (see (109.)) sin I cotj=sin a,cot (d-v)-sin: cot (d,-v). It is very easy to show by spherical trigonometry that this equation signifies that the instantaneous axis coincides with the line in which the principal plane is intersected by the plane of the two radii vectores*. In other words, we have this theorem: The principal plane always turns about the line in which it is intersected by the plane of the two radii vectores. It follows of course that the principal plane always touches the conical surface described in fixed space (relatively to the sun) by the-said -line. I think it probable that most persons would expect, at first sight, that the principal plane would always touch the conical surface described by the line of nodes, which, as has been just shown, is not the case. It is perhaps worth while to verify this result lay independent reasoning. 89. Let Roman letters refer, as in former articles, to axes of coordinates having any arbitraryJlxed directions. Then, putting A=m(yz'-zy'), &c. (as in art. 80.), and using i, a, G for current coordinates, the equation to the principal plane is (A+A,)0+(B+B,)n+(C+Ql=0; S . . . . . . (114.) and the line in which this plane is cut by its consecutive is determined by combining the equation (114.) with that obtained from it by differentiating the coefficients of ) with respect to t; namely, (A'+A) + (B'+ BE)+ ('+C' 0.(115.) Now from the fundamental equations itx + x dX I mx"+mPJT1 &C., we obtain A'=nm(yz`-zy')=Y -Z dz = nmMj(yz,Zy)I(8 -r) dy * Let 4 be the angle between the principal plane and the plane of the radii vectores; the former plane divides the angle I into two parts, of which one is ij and the other is -I; and we get two spherical triangles which have a common side j,. with adjacent angles. ? and 4' in one, -s and i-4 in the other; hence cot (0 -v)sinj= cot 4' sin i + cosj cos i cot(01-v)sinj=cot 4 sin i + coscosjo; and if cot 4' be eliminated between these, the result is the equation in the text. 344 PROFESSOR DONKIN ON THE (where 8 is the distance between m. and in,); and in like manner A'=-mom yz-Zy)(-3 _r~3 we have therefore A' + A =mm,(yz,-zy,) (r-d r-3), with similar expressions for B'+B', C'+C' so that, when the common factor mm,(r, -r ) is omitted, the equation (115.) becomes (yz,-zyJ)ff+(X (x-xz )g+ (xy,yx1)t= 0 which is evidently the equation to the plane containing the two radii vectores. Thus the theorem in question is verified. 90. To return from this.digression: the motion of the line of nodes in the principal plane will be given by putting a2=0 in either of the equations (102.), and introducing the value of c,0 sin v-l cosv from (103.). In this way we find, after slight reductions, d12 dfll ppsin I.v'=p, cos dI +p cos 1 ' in which we may substitute for cost, cos t, the values given by equations (110.); this gives sin 1 '=(p2+pp cosI +( p2 +pp, cos 1)i dt2 dfi? or, if we introduce the actual values of din dig we find pp, =-mmrrsin (d-Y) sin (k,) x jp cos . (3-r) +p,cos i,(;r) }. It is not my purpose however to enter fuirther into details; and I shall conclude this subject by briefly examining the consequences of a slightly different assumption as to the motion of the axes of coordinates. I shall suppose, namely, that the plane of xy still always coincides with the principal plane, but has a sliding motion such that the axis of x always coincides with the line of nodes. 91. The assumption made at the end of the last article 'implies the condition '=O; and 62 will no longer be 0, but must be determined by equations (102.) ; either of these gives (putting v'=v='0 and reducing by means of (103.), (109.), &c.) pp, sin I.w2=pcOSHIYd+p cos ' .(I 16.) which coincides, as of course it ought, with the expression given for Y' on the former hypothesis (art. 90.). The difference is that Q, Q, now no longer contain v. The values of W0, sv are obtained at once by putting v=0 in the equations (112.), (113.) ; and all the conclusions which were derived independently of any supposition as to the value of 2,, subsist as before, when modified by putting v=0. We may add one more equation, which is required in forming some of the expressions for the variations of the elements; namely tan 6 = -pi sin I 2 +p p, cos.( 17.) DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS OF DYNAMICS, ETC. 345 This is easily obtained from (109.) and (110.); and in like manner tanp sin I 2 a+p+p cosI I shall now recapitulate the results of the last supposition, so as to exhibit in one view the transformed differential equations of the problem of three bodies. It will be as well to repeat also the explanation of the symbols. 92. Signijication of the Symbols. M, m, m, are the masses of the sun, and of the two planets, and M+m=ji , M+m,--{. a-and e are the semiaxis and excentricity of the instantaneous ellipse described by m about the sun. a, and e, have the same meanings with reference to m,.

The same is true for m,, mutatis mutandis. X is the angle between the radii vectores so that Cos x= Cos 0 Cos 0,+ sin 0 sin 0, cos I.

Djffirential Equations of the Problem. 93.

The only parts of the preceding expressions of which the deduction is not perfectly obvious, are the terms involving I in the values of a', S, a', a. They are obtained, as has been sufficiently explained, from the expressions in art. 55, to which are to be added the values of dT &c. ((95.), art. 79.); on putting v=O, w&, disappears from the latter; and the values of ,, , cos , cos I, tan 2, tan 2 are to be introduced (equations (110.), (112.), (116.), (117.)). After some rather troublesome reductions, the expressions above given will be found. In these equations it will be recollected that the mean longitude of m is represented . d2 by ndt+s, and the differentiation with respect to a in da is only performed so fat as a appears explicitly. If we wished that the mean longitude should be expressed by nt+s, the only change in the equations would be that the differentiation with respect to a must l)e total; i. e. must extend to a as contained in nt A similar remark applies of course to a,. In actual use it would bie more convenient to introduce R, R, instead of Q Q,; the latter functions give a rather more symmetrical form to the equations, and are more convenient in general investigations. (The relation between them here is merely Q=mR, Q =m, RL,; in another part of the paper the symbol Q was used for -mR (art. 55.)). 95. If the equations of art. 93. were completely integrated, the intrinsic motion of the system would be completely determined; that is, we should know at any instant the dimensions of the two orbits, the mutual inclination of their planes, the position of their axes with respect to the line of nodes, the place of each planet in its or'bit, and (by (1 10.)) the inclination of each orbit to the principal plane. The position of the system relatively to fixed space would then have to be separately determined as follows The three quantities w, nJ,-, t'2 (see end of art. 92.), of which the values are ((1 12.), (I 13.), (116.)) given by the equations 2 sin I.wo= (P+P, cos I) +d +(p,+p cos I) d+ d all dI(QX Qdf a sin I.W2 (t+ cos I) + (p+ cosl>)d' MDCCCLv. 3 A 348, PROFESSOR DONKIN ON THE would be given functions of 1. Then if we call J the inclinatlion of the principal plane to an arbitrary fixed plane; Q the longitude of the line of intersection of these two planes, reckoned in the fixed plane from a fixed line; N the anble between this line of intersection and the line of nodes; we should have (as in art. 83. with a different notation) Xl=wo cos Nw1 sin N Q' sin J=c osin N+,1 cosN j.(118.) N'=w2cot J(co0 sin N+w1 cos N) and the integration of this system would give J, Q, N as functions of t, and so determine at any instant the position of the principal plane and of the line of nodes, relatively to fixed space. With respect to the motion of the principal plane, the following may be added. It has already been shown (art. 88, 89.) that the line about which it is at any instant turning, coincides with that in which it is intersected by the plane of the radii vectores; and the values of w, a w (see art. 88, putting v=O in the expressions there given) may be put in the form e2w"=m sin Tn (p cos K sin14 sin 0 cos 0) o'w m=MM sin I sin O sin d,* If the latter of these be multiplied by a, and then both sides of each squared, and the results added (after putting for o.2 on the right its value p2+p2+2pp, cos I), we find, observing that cos 0 cos P,+ sin 0 sin d1 cos I= cos x) r2/V0+&jmm2 sin I (-4) (p2 sin2 ,+psin2 d+2pp,sin Osin d, cos ), an expression which may be further transformed as follows. LXet A x, be the latitudes of mr M, (with reference to the principal plane) ; then sin Xsin 0 sin:, sin, =sin0d, sin:1; -o sins hence, since p= pi i-,we obtain 0.Vi i +< =mmaQ P4t) (sin2x + sin2 x, -2 sin x sin A, cosX). This gives the absolute angular velocity with which the principal plane is at any instant changing its direction in space ; it is evident that (if the supposition r,=r be excluded) it can never vanish except when both planets are in the line of nodes. The direction of the rotation is determined by the signs of wo and w,. 96. The system of differential equations given in art. 93. affords an example of the so-called " elinination of the nodes" in the problem of three bodies. JACOBI, by a very remarkable and ingenious transformation, has effected the elimination in a quite DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS OF DYNAMICS, ETC. 349 different manner*. The equations of art. 93. are merely transformations of the original differential equations of the problem, without any integrations; they are however in a form which might perhaps be used advantageously in certain cases for the purposes of physical astronomy. Those of JACOBI are obtained by employing all the four usual integrals of the problem, and are shown to include an additional integration. They have however the disadvantage of substituting the coordinates of two fictitious bodies for those of the actual planets, and would probably be inconvenient for ordinary practical use ; though in a theoretical point of view they seem to deserve more attention than they have hitherto received. It would be wrong to take leave of this celebrated problem without referring to another transformation by M. BERTRAND+, which, as has been remarked by a recent writer in the same journal, effects six integrations, and therefore represents the furthest advance which has yet been made towards a rigorous solution. APPENDIX A. When the method described in Theorem VII. (art. 49.) is applied to the solution of a system of equtations of the form (I.), of which n integrals, a, .. an, satisfying the conditions [at, aj]=0, are given, the first step is to express the n+ 1 partial difdX ~dX ferential coefficients d &c., and -h-; namely, the values of y,, ... y and -Z in terns of xw ... x., a,, ... as and t. The direct process is then to find X by integrating the expression yldxl+ydx2+..+y dx.-Zdt, and afterwards to form the remaining dX integral equations d-=bl, &c.: when this process is adopted, the inferior limits in the integrations are perfectly arbitrary; in other words, we may add to X an arbitrary function of a1, a2, ... an, without altering any of the general properties of the fintal system of integrals. But it is generally much more convenient to perform the differentiations with respect to a1, ... a,,frst, and integrate afterwards; thus we obtain the remaining equations in the form bAJ 5 dx+ T dX2+-*.+. da --dta When this plan is followed, the limits are still arbitrary if it be only required that the equations thus obtained shall be true; but if it be required that they shall form, with the given integrals, a normal solution, it is necessary to take the lim its in such a manner that the functions equated to bl, b2, ... bn shall be the partial differential coef. ficients with respect to al, a2, ... a,, of one and tihe same function; which will not generally be the case unless care be taken that it should be so. In practice, the expression for dX usually consists of several terms, of which each* Comptes Rendus, 1842, part 2. p. ^36, &C. t LIOuVILLE'S Journal, 1852.3 A 2 350 PROFESSOR DONKIN ON THE contains one of the variables only. Suppose one of these terms is P(x, a,, a2, ... a,)dx, so that, so far as this term is concerned, we have X: pj x a,, al 2, . an)dx, where A is an arbitrary function of a1, ... a.. Consequently dX atdp dA dx 3A1dasdx-p(A, a,,.. adA and we see that we should not in general obtain the differential coefficients with respect to a,, ... a, of one and the same function X, by merely integrating --, d &c., alda2 with respect to x, from the same inferior limit A, chosen at hazard. But it is evident that we shall attain this end if we adopt the following simple rule: Integrate d@, &c. with respect to x, taking the same inferior limit in each case, namely, either (1) a value A of x which satisfies the equation p(x, a, .. an)=O, or (2) any determinate constant (i. e. not a function of a,, ... an). For example, in the problem of central forces (Part I., art. 28, &c.), we had (see art. 19.) dX= hdt+ cdO+ (2m(h+ p(r)) k2r2dr (k'c2 sec' )AdX (where r, 0, X are the three variables). The very troublesome process of differentiating X with respect to h, k and c after first finding X by integrating the above expression, is avoided by the method adopted in art. 29; namely, by differentiating first, and integrating afterwards. In the integrations with respect to r, the inferior limit is one of the roots of the equation 2m(h+p(r)) -k2r-2=0 namely (in the case of elliptic motion), the perihelion distance; and in those with respect to X, the inferior limit is 0; so that the rule above given is observed. At the time of writing the article referred to, neither the rule itself, nor the necessity of attending to the limits, had occurred to me; it was therefore, strictly speaking, accidental that the final integrals were obtained in a normal form. In treating the problem of rotation (Section III.), I perceived the necessity of caution as to the limits, if the former order of proceeding were adopted; but preferred avoiding the risk of error altogether, by performing the integrations first, so as to obtain the actual expression for V. The final equations (R.), art. 44, might however be obtained in a more simple way by differentiatingfirst; thus we should have (see k ( equations (45.), (46.)), observing that ~-k V &c.

I do not regret however having introduced the rather prolix investigation of arts. 39 and 43, because it is interesting to know the actual value of V (equation (48.)), which the method just given leaves undetermined. 352 PROFESSOR DONKIN ON THVE APPENDIX B. On the subject of the transformation of elements, the following additional remarks will hardly be superfluous. Suppose ? is originally a function of tie elements a, b, C, &c. with 1; and let a, (3 re &c. be other quantities connected with a, b, c, &c., by equations such as d=AAda+BdP+Cdr+...?Kdt, . ..(a.) where A, B, C, ... K are given functions of ac, (3, r.... t; or by equations such as da=Ada+B~db+ ... +Kdt,. where A, &c. are given functions of a, , ....1 t. In either case, if each of thie equations be integrable per se, we may consider a, b, c, .... as functions of 0, y, ...., and such equations as ~~.(. ) daC da d . are both significant and true. But if the expressions on the right of the equations (a.) be not differentials per se, the equations (Q.) are either unmeaning or untrue. For the symbol da implies one of two things; either, that Q is expressed in terms of oa ,3 ..t I without arbitrary constants (i. e. that the transformation of Q can be actually effected without integrating the differential equations of the problem), which is manifestly impossible, unless (a.), &c. be integrable per se; or else, that the differential equations are to be conceived to have been completely integrated, so that a, b, &c., and consequently A1, Be &c., are known as functions of t and arbitrary constants, whereby the rigbhthand side of (a.) becomes an explicit function of t (and arbitrary constants) so that &c. may by integration be expressed in the same way, and, by means of (a.), a, b, &c. may be similarly expressed, and finally, by algebraical elimination, a, b, &c. become functions of a, (3, &c., t, and arbitrary constants. On this supposition, dn has a meaning, but the equation (Q.) is untrue; foi we must have dQ df da dI db cia and it is manifestly not true that Z=A, &c. in this case, because the equation da=Ada+BdP+... +Kdt not being integrable per se, only subsists for those variations of ah (3, &c. which actually take place during the instant dt; whereas the equation da a da da=_ da+ dP?...+ dt subsists for arbitrary variations of all the variables. This view of the subject entirely DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS OF DYNAMICS, ETC. 353 coincides, in substance, with that taken by JACOBI; but the above mode of stating it may tend to make it clearer, and to call attention to a matter which, so far as I know, is not so much as mentioned in any of the elementary works usually in the hands of students of ;)hysical astronomy. [Addition to APPENDIX B.] Received March 1, 1855. The remark made above, that the symbol dfl is unmeaning in the case considered, is not of course intended to imply that a meaning may not be given to it; but then such meaning is different from the ordinary signification of the symbol, which is a partial derivedfunction. The whole matter may be strikingly illustrated by a simple example. Consider the movement of a rigid body about a fixed point. Adopting the nota. tion of art. 40 (Part I.), we have pdt= -cos pddsin 0 sin pd4, qdt= sin pdOsin 0 cos pd4; rdtd;+ cos d4,. Let a, [, y be three new variables, defined by the equations a= fpdt, 13=5qdt, r= rdt; so that da=pdt, &c. Then the above equations give d0=-cos pdos+ sinp d[, dp=dy+ cot O(sin Adze+ cospdP d'4= cosec d(sin Ados+ cos pd3). Here , f3, ry are the sums of the elementary angles described about the axes in the course of the motion; and no one would maintain that 0, p, 4, arefunctions of a, [, y, for the values of the latter variables at any time do not determine the values of the former. If therefore we choose to write such equations as dO dO do Cos, sin A, &c., we must admit that d '% &c. are not partial derived functions in the ordinary sense. At most, d is the derived function of that function of oa which 0 would become if p dca and y were maintained invariable, i. e. if the motion were restricted to a rotation d2O0 d2?O about the A-axis. Again, if we admit such symbols as da d dfl we must interpret them as follows: d2O d dO dcosp .d dedd7 I do d sdMsin o ,' 354 PROFESSOR DONKIN ON THE but c,= Cot 0 cos a' and therefore d20 cot D sin p cos ; d20 and in like manner we find the same value for so that in this particular case ..d2o d20 the condition d20 d20 is verified. But ifw ti d20 d28 But if we take and in the same way, we find the former = sin p and the latter =0, so that in this case the condition is not verf/led. The geometrical meaning 'of this is obvious; analytically it is merely an instance of a general fact, pointed out by JACOBI namely, that the effect of two successive pseudo-dffferentiations with respect "to two independent variables, is not generally independent of the order of operations. If V be the potential of another body, given in position, upon the body considered, then V is a function of 0, ,, 4, and dVdO+dV+ dV dV= do d+ dim @+ -W~dq 4 and if we substitute for do, dp, dqi their values in terms of da, dP, dy, we obtain an expression which we may call Ldk+Mdp+Ndr, L, M, N being functions of 0, p, ,4 dY dY dY do S do 5 of which, as is well known, the mechanical meanings are the moments of the attraction of the second body about the three axes. Here again no one would dV maintain that V is a function of a, 3, r; and if, as is often done, we say -d-=L, &c., the above remarks apply in all respects to these equations. I should have thought it superfluous to dwell so mnuch on these points if it had not appeared that writers on physical astronomy have in some instances either overlooked the distinction between real and pseudo-differentiation, or at least have failed to point it out to their readers. The only discussion of the subject which I have met with is that given by JACOBI, in the correspondence referred to. dV It may be added, that in general investigations, where symbols such as d &c. may be used without defining the nature of V, or the precise meaning of a, P, &c., serious errors might be committed if it were assumed that the condition dWV dWV dxdp dpda always subsisted. APPENDIX C. The theorems relating to the transformation of coordinates, given in Section VI., may be made more general, and in mlany cases mnore useful, as folllows: DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS OF DYNAMICS, ETC. 3.5 If xl, x2, ... X.~ be the coordinates employed in the first statement of any dynamical problem, the differential equations are comprehended in the formula fd1W\ dW~ i{j( dxm -d7 Xi = O.* (*.) [If there be any forces, such as those arising fromn a resisting medium, which do not satisfy the natural conditions of integrability, then on the right-hand side of the formula (D.), instead of 0 we shall have an expression such as f i(Xi bi) I ut such terms are easily introduced and allowed for separately, and do not affect the following investigation. I shall therefore here assume that they do not exist.] In the above formula, W is a given function of xl, ... X,, xl, ... XI, which may also explicitly contain t. In Section VI. the only case contemplated was that in which xw, ... x3C are independent coordinates; in which case the formula (D).) is equivalent to n separate equations, since 4x1, &c. are wholly arbitrary and independent. In practice, however, it is often more convenient to use, at first, a set of coordinates more in number than the independent variables of the problem, and therefore subject to equations of condition. Let us assume then that the n coordinates x1, ... x,, are subject to r equations of condition, L1=0, L =0, ... =, where Li, &c. may explicitly contain t, besides the n variables x1, &c. dWv If we introduce the n conjugate variables yg, ... y,, defined by the equations yj= dab and take Z a function of xi, &c., y1, &c. (with or without t), defined by the equation Z=[WI + *Xl*y1 + . + [nx1] (the brackets indicating that xc, &c. are expressed in terms of y, &c.), then it follows exactly as in art. 18 (Part I.), that the formula (D.) will be changed into the system / dZ x=dyi dZ . ? . . (E.) [In the most usual problems W is of the form T+U, where T is homogeneous and of the second degree in xl, &c., and U does not contain xl, &c. at all. In this case Z is only T-U expressed in terms of yg, &c., instead of x'l, &c. But T is not necessarily homogeneous; in fact it is not so in problems relating to motion relative to the earth, as affected by the earth's rotation.] Let us now s5txpose that the system (E.) is to be transformed by the introduction of the m independent coordinates t 2, ... t, and of the new conjugate variables 1, 712) ... 42; where mnn-r. And let it be required to investigate a theorem by means of which the transformation may be effected without recurring to the original formula (D.).

If then the formula (D.) he transformed by expressing X &c. x &c. in this manner, it becomes, as is well known, di(-' )-di}ej ? where (W) represents the result of transforming W as above; and since te &c. are now independent, this formula breaks up into the mn separate equations _d(W)_ d(W) (F.) V dt ,! dg. ...* d(W) Moreover, if we now define ni by the equation (t =nj, and put T ( (W) + (g)I+ * + (n8 where (0), &c. are expressed in terms of t &c., we know already (art. 18.) that the system (F.) becomes dP , dP Now let P be a function of the m new variables Fl .. im and of the n old variables y1, ... ,y (with or without t), defined by the equation P= (Xl)Y I + (X2),y2 + + ?

And since each equation of condition gives, dZ if differentiated totally with respect to t, with the substitution of for xi, an equation such as dL dL dZ dL dZ O=t dl dy+..+yx dy. . . . . . (L.) the m equations (n.) with the r equations L (in which last xj, &c. must be expressed, after the differentiation, in terms of I, &c.), give n equations by means of which Y, ... Y. may be expressed in terms of 0, &c., i, &c., and can be so expressed only in one way. Lastly, the value of T (see equations (G.)), may be obtained as follows Since -+ anl Z=-[W] + xly+... + [']yn, and (W) is only [W] differently expressed, we have, without reference to modes of expression, On the other hand, since P can contain t explicitly only through (xj), &c., we have dP_ d dt ividt J and also di(xtyi) = Ei (d(d)) + Ei (P ) hence, observing that d we obtain E-Ei(xyi) =-dPdt dIP and therefore, finally, T=Z dP so that Zt must become identical with A, when expressed entirely in terms of the new variables. These results may be stated in the form of the following theorem. The system (E.) is transformed into the system (G.) by the following substitutions: (1) x, ... xa, are expressed in terms of E1 ., by means of the m equations which define the latter variables, together with the nr-m equations of condition L , . .. ~L,-=0 (r=n-wm). (2) 8i, ... 7m are defined by the m equations d-=w; where the modulus of transformation P is given by the equation P = (x]1)yl + (X2)y2 + *+ (Xn)Yn, (xl), &c. being expressed in terms of 1, &c., so that P is explicitly a function of 0, ... .t.n, with or without t. 2BX2 358 ON THE DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS OF I)YNAMICS, ETC. (3) { is defined by the equation T=Zd I in which (after the explicit differentiation of P with respect to t), Xi, &c., y9, &c. are to be expressed in terms of the new variables. yl, &c. are thus expressible by the help of the m equations d and the dL zdL dZx n-m equations dZ +iT _o. If (X1), &c., do not contain t explicitly, then dP =0, and T is obtained merely by expressing Z in terms of the new variables. It may be observed that the whole of the above reasoning would apply to the case in which the new variables 0i .m are more in number than the independent vanidP ables of the problem (or m>n-r), with this exception; that the m equations d together with the r equations obtained by differentiating the equations of condition totally with respect to t, would be more than sufficient to express yi, ... ye, in terms of the new variables; consequentlyyl, &c. might be so expressed in different ways, and therefore, although the value of Y obtained by the above rule would certainly be the same as that obtained by recurring to the original formula (D.), theform of T might be different, and therefore the resulting formula erroneous. There must doubtless exist some rule for choosing n-m combinations of the equations of condition in such a way as to lead to the correct forms of y', --. as functions of the new variables; but I have not at present attempted to investigate it, and perhaps it would be hardly worth while. The theorem in the case in which the new coordinates are independent, may, I believe, be practically useful.
