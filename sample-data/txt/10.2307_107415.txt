: 280 3 XXXTI. Catalogue of North Polar Distances of Ezighty-four principalfixed Stars, deduced from Observations made with the Mural Circle at the Royal Observatory. By John Pond, Esq. Astronomer Royal, F. R.e S Read July 8, 1813. I ME Catalogue, which I have the honour to transmit to the Society, is deduced from the whole of the observations made w ith the mural circle, from its first erection in J une, 1 812, to the present time. I am still employed in endeavouring to give it a greater degree of precision, and when it is entirely finished, I propose to submit some of the observations themselves to the Society, and explain the method by which the results have been obtained. I have already mentioned, that I use neither level nor plumbline; but determine the position of the instrument by means of a standard catalogue of stars derived from the instrument itself, in such a manner, that every series of observation of these stars, serves the double purpose of ascertaining the posisition of the instrument, and at the same time improving the Catalogue. As the present Catalogue has been formed by frequently changing the position of the telescope on the circle, for the purpose of correcting every possible error of division, my observations have not been calculated to decide the question of parallax which has been suspected to exist in es Lyrx, a Mr. POND'S Catalogue, &Cc. e.8 Aquilhe, and some other stars. But from this time forward, I propose to use the instrument in one position of the telescope, with the hope of ascertaining, if not the parallax of these stars, at least the limits, which it does not exceed. IThough the change of position in the telescope, by which all error of division is avoided, is one of the most beautiful properties of this instrument, yet so accurately-is it divided, that I cannot perceive, with certainty, any effect produced by this change, for I have often found as great a discordance between two series of observations made on the same divisions, as when they are entirely changed by a new position of the telescope. What the error of division may amount to in any one position, I cannot exactly say; but, I think, when the six microscopes are used, it can never exceed half a second, and very rarely amounts to half that quantity. That some opinion may be :formed of the accuracy of this instrument, I have subjoined to the Catalogue the results of the observations of some of the standard stars, whose places I am anxious :to determine with the greatest precision, since I propose in future to determine all north polar distances by comparison with these stars; precisely in the same manner as right ascensions are now determined by comparison with the thirty-six stars, whose places have been so accurately determined by Dr. MASKELYNE. 282 Mr. POND'S Catalogue of Eighty-four GENERAL CATALOGUE. | Names of Stars. | No. of N.

R, r $a :302 Mr. POND'S Catalogue of Eighty-four Remarks on the above Observations. a Lyra and a Aquilas having been supposed subject to a sensible parallax, I have, as I mentioned before, reserved them for future examination. The observations which I have already made,, on these stars, and particularly on z Aquila, are not incompatible with this supposition, though I cannot at present venture to decide whether the small discordances I have met with are to be attributed to any regular cause, or are only accidental. Whenever I speak of the degree of exactness to which any result may be depended upon, I allude only to the mechanical measure given by the instrument. I have every reason to believe, that if two fixed and well defined points could be placed in the plane of the meridian, I could, in a very short time, measure their angular distance to within a tenth of a second; but astronomers must be well aware that the stars are not presented to us in this simple form, and that the sources from w hich small errors may arise, either in the observations themselves or subsequent computation, are so very numerous, that anomalies will occur even to the most careful observer, which he will in vain endeavour to explain. With respect to the parallax of a Lyrm, I might observe that it is a star so badly defined, and so little adapted for exact observation, that a parallax of half a second would not be easy to determine even with the Greenwich circle. Aquil is in some 'respects a better star for observation, but only half its actual parallax would be sensible in dechli nation. of the principlfixed tar W There are several other stars much better adapted for this investigation, even should their distance be supposed more than double, such are Polaris, sq Urse maj. M Cygni, P Urs& min. and ry Draconis; now, in these I lavke not hitherto found any sensible parallax; occasional discordance has -frequentily suggested some slight hopes, but these have always been disappointed by continuing the observations. It is, however, useless now to anticipate this subject farther. Those stars which are in the general Catalogue, but which do not form part of the standard Catalogue, I presume to be exact to the nearest second. I have not included any star in the standard Catalogue south of the equator, on account of the uncertainty of refraction.
