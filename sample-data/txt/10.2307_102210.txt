K K Water K L L K (2) (3) inquisitive Sea-man (he has writ a large Folio of Navigation) would needs descend into it, and his Narative was as followeth: `Upon the second of July 1669. I descended by `Ropes affixt at the top of an old Lead-Oar Pit, four `Fathoms almost Perpendicular, and from thence three `Fathoms more obliquely, between two great Rocks, `where I found the Mouth~ of this spacious Place: from `which, a Mine-man and my self lowred our felves by `Ropes twenty five Fathoms perpendicular, into a very `large Place, which resembled to us the form of a `Horse-shoo; for we stuck lighted Candles all the way `we went, to discover what we could find Remarkable. `At length we came to a River or great Water, which I `found to be twenty Fathoms broad, and eight Fathoms `deep. The Mine-man would have perswaded me, that `this River ebbed and flowed,for that some ten Fathoms `above the place, we now were in, we found the Wa`ter had sometime been: but I proved the contrary, `by staying there from three hours Floud to two hours `Ebb, in which time we found no alteration of this Ri`ver. Besides its waters were fresh, sweet and cool, and `the surface of this Water, as it is now at eight Fathom `deep, lies lower than the bottom of any part of the Se`vern-Sea near us, so that it can have no community `with it, and consequently neither flux nor reflux, but `in Winter and Summer,as all ~,Lakes and Loughs `(which I take this to be) have. As we were walking `by this River thirty two Fathoms under ground, we `discovered a great hollowness in a Rock, some thirty `foot above us; so that I got a Ladder down to us, and `the Mine-man went up the Ladder to that Place, and `walk'd into it about threescore and ten Paces, till he `just lost sight of me, and from thence chearfully call'd `to me, and told me he had found what he looked `for, a Rich Mine. But his joy was presently changed `into amazement, and he returned affrighted by the `sight of an Evil Spirit, which we cannot perswade him `but he saw, and for that reason will go thither no `more. `Here (4) `Here are abundance of strange Places, the flooring `being a kind of a white Stone, enameled with Lead `Oar, and the pendent Rocks were glazed with Salt`Peter, which distilled upon them from above, and time `had putrified. `After some hours stay there, we ascended without `much hurt, other than scratching our selves in divers `places by climbing the sharp Rocks. But four days `together, after my return from thence, I was troubled `with an unusual and violent Head-ach, which I impute `to my being in that Vault. This is a true account of that `Place so much talkt of. This Captain Sturmy falling from his Head-ach into a Feaver and dying; what from his Death, and the Opinion of an Evil Spirit, no body was willing to have any more to do with the said Hole from that time to this. But Captain Collins Commander of the Merlin Yeacht (who is by His Majesty appointed to take a Survey of the Coast of England) coming into the setern to that end, and visiting Sir Robert Southwel near Kingrode, and entertaining him from time to time with the Adventures of his Navigation (having shared in the late Voyage with Captain Wood to Nova Zembla, and formerly Sayled in the Eat Indies near as high as Japan) Sir Robert on his part, told him how the story of this Hole had amused the Country; and how the said Narrative had formerly been sent to His Majesty and the Royal Society; and that there wanted only some courage, to find out the bottom of it. The Captain presently resolved to adventure,and so on the 18 and 19th. of September 1682. he took several of his men, with Ropes and Tackling fitting to descend, with Lines to measure any Length or Depth, also with Candles, Torches, and a speaking Trumpet. What he found does much lessen the Credit and Tertour of this Hole, as will appear by the Figure he took thereof, and the Description following: `'Tis down the Tunnel from the superficies to the `opening of the Cavity below, 39 Yards. Then the Hole `spreading into an irregular oblong-figure, is in the `greatest (5) `greatest length 75 yards, and in the greatest breadth `41 Yards. From the highest part of the Roof to the wa`ter, was then 19 yards. The Water was now in a Pool: `at the North end, being the deepest part, it was in `length 27 yards, in breadth 12, and only 5 yards and `a halfdeep; two Rocks appeared above the Water all `covered with Mud,but the water sweet and good. There `was a large Circle of Mud round the Pool, and far up `towards the South end, which shewed that the water `has at other times been 6 Yards higher than at present. `The Tunnel or passage down, was somewhat oblique, `very Ragged and Rocky; in some places it was two `yards wide, and insome 3 or 4, but nothing observable `therein, save here and there some of that Sparr which `usually attends the Mines of Lead-Oar. In the way, `30 yards down, there runs in, southward, a passage of 29 `yards in length, parallel to the superficies above. It `was two and three yards high, and commonly as broad, `and alike Rocky as the Tunnel, with some appearances `of Sparr, but nothing else in it except a few Bats. `The Cavity below was in like manner Rocky and `very irregular, the Candles and Torches burut clear, so `as to discover the whole extent thereof; nor was the `Air any thing offensive. The three men that went down `the first day stayed below two hours and a half. The `next day the Captain went down, with seven or eight `men, who stayd below for an hour, and observed all `things. `The bottom of this Hole where the Land-waters `do gather, is 59 Yards down from the superficies of the `Earth, and by good Calculation, the same bottom, is `twenty yards above the highest Rising of the Severn, `and lyes into the Land, about three miles distant from `it. `There was no other need of the speaking Trumpet, `than to keep much noise, such as the like Cavity will `every where afford, for otherwise those above, and `those below, spoke with reasonable freedom unto each `other.
