John Martyn M. D. F. R. S. &c. to the President, concerning the same. S I R, Chelsea, March 14. 1749. I O N C E more trouble you with the Mention of an Earthquake, which was felt here on Thursday the 8th instant, at about 5 half Read March 15. 1749. [631] half an Hour after 5 in the Morning. It was much stronger than that which happen'd in February; two great Shocks being felt presently after each other. Those who were out of Doors felt the Ground shake under them very sensibly; whereas, in the former, few were sensible of the Shock, except those who were in Houses. I do not hear of any Mischief done by it in this Neighbourhood; neither can I learn that it extended farther Westward than the former. I am very well assured, that it was strongly felt at Fulham, and at Turnham-Green. Several were sensible of a smaller Shock about 3 the same Morning; and some talk of unusual Appearances in the Air. But this last Circumstance seems not very well attested. For my own part, I look'd out of my Chamber-Window to the S. W. at a Quarter after 5, and only perceived it to be a grey Morning, such as usually predicts a fine Day. I am, Sir, with the greatest Respect, Your most humble Servant, John Martyn. XIX.
