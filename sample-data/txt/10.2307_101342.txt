An Account of the Advantage of Virginia for building Ships; communicated by an Observing Gentleman. 1. THE Country of Virginia all over abounds with large and tall Oakes of at least 50 or 60 feet in height of clear timber, without boughs or branchings, being very fit to make plank of any seize, very tough, and excellently well enduring the water; as we know by good experience. 2. With abundance of Pines for Masts, no country, that we know, in the world is better stored than Virginia. Besides there is another sort of wood,called Cypress, which is far better than any Pine for Masts, it being of as tough and springy a nature as yew.tree; bending beyond credit; when dry, much lighter than Fire, and so well lasting in wet and dry, that it seems rather to polish than perish in the weather: And this is known by much use, and several Experiments. 3. The same Country affords great abundance of Old Pine for the making of Rosin, Pitch and Tar; of which they have there made several quantities for their own use, and if occasion were, could fully supply the Kingdom of England 4. The conveniency of planting Hemp for Cardage and ail-cloths in that Country is so great, that England might in D d d d d d a (6016) a short time be supplied therewith,without being beholding to other nations for it. 5. To these particulars add the great abundance of Ironstone in Virginia,which hath already been tryed and found very good; the conveniency of Wood and Lime-stone being a good inducement to the making of Iron, which might be done at a much less rate there than here. Of which there hath been a calculation formerly made, considering every mans labour, and what is necessary to be disbursed for every Artist and Labourer, as to their transportation, diet, and all other materials for the work of Iron. All which is referred to the consideration of those, who are concerned in a Matter of this importance.
