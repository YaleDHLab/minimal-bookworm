[ 6569 ] XXIX. Sequel to a paper on the Reduction of the Thiermmetrical Observations ade at the Apartments of the Roya Society. By JAM ES GLAISHER, Esq., F. R.S., of the Royal Observatory, Greenwich. Received December 14, 1849,-Read February 28, 1850. IN a paper which the Royal Society did me the honour to publish in the last volume of its Transactions, I gave the results found from all the thermometrical observations whichl have been taken at the Apartments of this Society; and I stated that I had made some progress in the connection of this series of results with those deduced from the observations at the Royal Observatory, Greenwich. Since that time I have reduced the two series of observations to one and the same series, and I have now the honour to lay the results from their combination before the Society. In my former paper I stated that no observations had been taken between the years 1781 and 1786. Had the particulars of these years been about their average values, their omission would not have materially affected the final results, but on examination I found that those years were distinguished by very severe weather, and that their omission would have a sensible effect; I have therefore supplied these particulars, as detailed below. I also stated that it was doubtful whether the temperatures, as determined for Somnerset House, were influenced by local causes. I have endeavoured to collect information upon this subject, and of which I shall speak presently. I shall adopt the same plan in the arrangement of the final results, which I pursued in my former paper, and present. them for month ly, quarterly and yearly periods. The numbering of the Tables is continued from the former paper. It may tend to clearness if I speak of each preliminary investigation separately. Determination of the Mean Temperature of the Air at Lyndon in Rutlandshire, the longitude of which place is 00 3' East of Greenwich and the latitude is 520 32' North,for every month in the years fronz 1771 to 1799. The results of meteorological observations taken by THOMAs BARKER, Esq., at Lyndon in Rutlandshire, and which, seems to have been taken with care, were published in the volumes of the Philosophical Transactions for the years 1772 to 1799. From these papers I have determined the nean monthly temperatures of the air, and which are shown in the following Table:MDcccL. 4 D 570 MR.

The observations which most fully satisfy these conditions are those made by Mr. THOMAS SQUIRE of Epping. This gentleman, on my request to furnish me with the monthly means of his observations for comparison with those of this Society, most promptly and obligingly sent me the monthly mean from twenty-eight years' observations taken on every day at 811 in the morning. The thermometer with which the observations were made was placed in the shade, at the height of 5 feet above the ground, facing the N.E., and an open country. These numbers I have reduced to mean values by the application of corrections, for that put pose (see my paper in Philosophical' rrmansactions, Part I. 1 S48) then I further reduced them to the elevation at Somerset House and for (hiference of latin tude, and in this way the next Table was formed.

PS And the mean temperature of the whole period was nearly of the same value at both places. Having obtained these results, and finding that during the timne the sun was situated north of the equator the temperature at the Apartments of the Royal Society was lower than at Epping, and that it was higher during the time the sun had south declination, I requested Mr. SQUIRE to furnish me with full particulars with respect to the position of his instrument to the sun and to surrounding objects: the following is the information he gave me: "The thermometer hangs near the north angle of a small projecting pier of a wall, nearly close to the brickwork, facing the N.E., and an open country. At the back of thie wall is a grape-vine, and when in leaf, it so shades the wall that its temperature is not much affected by the sun's rays; but, before the vine is in leaf, it may raise the temperature a trifle; yet from some casual observations scattered over my journal as tests, I do not find that the said thermometer is sensibly influenced by the heat of the sun at 8 A.M., the time of reading the instrument. On the 13th of May, 1847, 1 moved the thermometer a few feet from its former position on the wall, with the same aspect, but, at the back of this part of the wall, there is a sort of grotto or summer-house, which is covered by thatch and completely interrupts the sun's rays from the wall; hence its present situation may perhaps be considered more eligible for a mean temperature than its former position, but I do not find any difference worth notice." The general fact, however, of a higher winter temperature, and of a lower summer temperature at the Apartments of the Royal Society, is satisfactorily proved by both sets of comparisons, and it is evident that the same cause has been in operation at both times, and to the same amount. There can be no doubt that this cause is the vicinity of the river Thames to the locality of the observations. 576 MR. GLAISHER ON THE THERMOMETRICAL OBSERVATIONS TAKEN AT Determinahiton of the M1onthly Mean Temperature of the water of the Thames by night and by day,from the year 1846 to the yeai' 1849. The observations to determine the temperature of the Thames water are made by Lieut. SANDERS, R.N. The instruments consist of one maximum thermometer and of one minimum thermometer, suspended from the sides of the Dreadnought Hospital Ship, in a perforated trunk placed at about 2 feet below the surface of the water. The range of temperature during the day is usually about 20, and the simple arithmetic mean of the readings of the maximum and mminiutn thermonmeters shows the mean temperature of the water.

Trhese numbers are very large, and will fully account for the little higher temperature possessed by places in the vicinity of the river, and these differences of temperature are probably the fruitful source of the London fogs. Mr. SANDERS, at my request, has taken daily observations of the temperature of the air at 32 feet above the water of the Thames at the hours of 6 A.M. and 6 P.M. during the years 1847 and 1848, and at the hours of 9 A.m. and 9 P.M. in the year 1849. The result of these observations, compared with Simultaneous observations taken at the Royal Observatory, is as follows:-that the temperature of the air 32 feet above THE ROYAL SOCIETY, AND AT THE ROYAL OBSERVATORY, GREENWICH. 577 the water, exceeds that at the observatory at 6 A.M. by 10-6; i0 V; 00.8; 00.3; 00 6; 0?7; 0? 9; 0.08; 00.2; 0?O and 00 SS in the twelve months respectively; and at 6 P.M. by 10.2; 00.8; 1? 0; 00?8; 00.7; 00.8; 00?6 ; 00.8; 10.3 ; 10.0; 10.7 and 00.9, in the twelve months respectively; that at 9 A.M. it was in excess in January by 10.3; February by 1? 5; March by 00.6; April by 004; May by 20.2; June by 00.4; and in October by 005; that it was of a lower temperature in July by 00?7; August by 00.5; and in September by 00.1 ; that at 9 P.M. it was always of a higher temperature: the excesses were 00.1 00?3; 007; 00.3; 10.9; 20.9; 10.5 ; 30.2; 10.2 and 10.3 respectively. From these numbers, it seems that during the night hours, at all seasons of the year, the temperature of the air at the Dreadnought Hospital Ship is higher than at the Observatory, and that it is below only during the midday hours. At times of extreme temperature the effect of the water -upon the temperature of the air is very great. On February 12, 1847, the temperature of the air at my house, which is situated about one mile and a half from the rivet, was 60.0; the lowest reading, 322 feet above the water of the TIatmes, was 160.0; the temperature of the water was 330; its heating effect upon the air in its immediate vicinity amounted to 10?; at the Observatory the reading was 100.5; and the heat of the water of the Thames seems to have influenced the temperature of the air at the Observatory to the amount of 40. Some time since, on comparing the temperatures of the air as recorded in the Philosophical Transactions in the year 1814, with corresponding tenmperatures as observed at Greenwich, I doubted the accuracy of the former in many instances, on account of their much higher values; these investigations have now led me to believe that the temperatures, as recorded in the Philosophical Transactions for that year, are correct.

GLAISHER ON THE THERMOMETRICAL OBSERVATIONS TAKEN AT By taking the means of the numbers in each column of differences, we find that the temperature of the air at the Apartments of the Royal Society was Higher than at the Royal Observatory, Greenwich, in January bv . . ]P6 Higher than at the Royal Observatory, Greenwichl, in February by . 1P4 Higher than at the Royal Observatory, Greenwich, in March by . . 1 Higher than at the Royal Observatory, Greenwich, in April by . . .1 Higher than at the Royal Observatory, Greenwich, in May by . . . 1 Higher than at the Royal Observatory, Greenwich, in June by . . . 09 Higher than at the Royal Observatory, Greenwich, in July by . . . 1-0 Higher than at the Royal Observatory, Greenwich, in August by . . 13 Higher than at the Royal Observatory, Greenwich, in September by . 11 Higher than at the Royal Observatory, Greenwich, in October by . . 1-3 Higher than at the Royal Observatory, Greenwich, in Novernber by . 13 Higher than at the Royal Observatory, Greenwich, in December bv . 1.4 And upon the whole year the excess of temperature at Somerset House was 10.2; and to reduce readings taken at Somerset House to those at Greenwich, it is necessary to subtract the preceding numbers from them ; and it is necessary to increase the readings of the Royal Observatory by the above numbers to make them comparable with those taken at the Royal Society. One part of these differences is owing to the difference of elevation, and which will amount to about 00.3; the greater part of the remaining difference is most probably owing to the vicinity of the water of the Thames, whose temperature during the night hours, at all seasons of the year, is several degrees higher than that of the air (see remarks following Table XIII.). The general result of the preceding investigations, with respect to the temperatures of London and the country is, that those parts of London situated near the river Thames, are somewhat warmer upon the whole year than the country, but that those parts of London which are situated at some distance from the river, do not enjoy higher temperatures than those due to their latitudes. I proceed now to reduce the results at Somerset House to those of the Royal Observatory, Greenwich, by applying the numbers following the preceding Table to the nuinl)ers in Table I. of my former paper, and to those in Table X. till the year 1840. After this date the numbers are extracted from the several volmines of the Greenwich Meteorological Observations.

TH E ROYAL SOCIETY, AND AT THE ROYAL OBSERVATORY, GREENWICH. 583 The mean of all the differences between the hottest and coldest months in every year is 280.5. In the year 1790 the difference was 210.3 only, and in the year 1780 it was as large as 37 ,1, these numbers being respectively the smallest and largest within the period of seventy-nine years. The coldest month in the year has occurred in January forty-three timnes, in February fifteen, in December twenty-one, and in March once; this unusual circumstance took place in the year 1837. The hottest month in the year has taken place five tirmes in June, forty-seven times in July, twentv-five times in August, and three times in September. The following are the values of the extreme mean temperatures in every month In January li9S the mean temperature was 23'9, and in January 1796 it was 45'3. In February 1785 the mean temperature was 3034, and in February 1794 it was 4457. In March 1785 the mean temperature was 3309, and in March 1780 it was 4942. In April 1771 the mean temperature was 38'7, and in April 1844 it was 51'7. In May 1773 the mean temperature was 47'5, and in May 1848 it was 5917. In June 1816 the mean temperature was 53 1, and in June 1846 it was 65'3. In July 1816 the mean temperature was 54,5, and in July 1778 it was 67'0. In August 1817 the mean temperature was 554, and in August 1780 it was 65 7. In September 1786 the mean temperature was 513, and in September 181" it was 62'3. In October 1784 the mean temperature was 439, and in October 1811 and 1831 it was 55 0. In November 1782 the mean temperature was 34'7, and in November 1822 it was 48'2. In December 1788 the mean temperature was 29'0, and in December 1806 it was 46'8. It is clear from these numbers that observations for a few years only can never be of great importance, when we consider that the difference of the monthly means of the winter months may be as 'large as 200 and of the summer months of l 10 or 120. By taking the means of the numbers in the Table in different groups of years the next Table is formed.

The numbers in the preceding Table very clearly show that causes exist at different times, which raise or depress the temperature, and which continue through long periods. As in the distribution of the positive and negative signs in the space of seventynine years, we perceive a, gradual increasing preponderance of the positive signs over the negative signs, it seems that the temperature of the climate during this period has increased. As the mean results from so long a series of observations may be considered as true, having the advantage of being free from errors of observation and from those arising from imperfect instruments, we may really consider the numbers in the above Table as abnormal values; yet as it seems most desirable to have those at the beginning of the series confirmed by the description of each year, made without instrumental means, for this purpose, as well as for the comparison of the, character of the climate at the beginning and at the end of the series, I have collected the following brief particulars of every year till that of 1800; after this time the general characters of the years are well known. 1771.-There were frequent and very sharp frosts till April 20. On February 12 the reading of the thermometer was as low as 40; the month of May was warm; the summer was cool and dry; October was a wet and windy month, and the weather was mild to the end of the year. The severe weather of the beginning of the year caused a bad seed time, and the harvest was very late. 1772.-The beginning of the year was mild ; from the middle of January frosts and great snows were frequent, and continued to the middle of March. The summer was very fine; the autumn was mild but wet, and there was no frost till December 22. 1773.-With the exception of the latter part of February, which was stormy and wet, there was much fine weather till the beginning of May; then many mornings were frosty, after which heavy rain fell frequently till June. The summer was fine; the autumn was wet. There were sharp frosts at the end of November and at the beginning of December. 1774.-The year began with severe frost, and for nearly two months the ground was frost-bound ; occasionally there were great rains or snow; the weather was more moderate in April; the summer was cool with heavy rains. The autumnal months were wet, particularly in September. Some snow fell in November and beginning of December. This year was remarkably wet. 1775.-rrhe weather was mild at the beginning of the year. The summer was dry MIDCCCL. 4 F 586 IMR. GLAISHER ON THE THERMOMETRICAL OBSERVATIONS TAKEN AT and hot; thunder-storms were frequent in autumn. The year was very fine, and grain was cheaper than it had been for many years past. 1776.-In January there fell a greater quantity of snow than had fallen for some years, and the frost was supposed to have been the most severe since 1740. The frost went away at the beginning of February, and the weather following was mild and wet; it became hot about the middle of April. May was cold and dry, with north winds; after this the weather was mostly fine till the end of December when there was a sharp frost. 1777.-The year began with a sharp frost, and heavy falls of snow continued till towards the end of February; for a few days about the end of March the weather was unusually hot, the reading of the thermometer being nearly 700; after this the weather was windy and cold till June. The latter part of the summer and autumn was fine. The year ended with frost and snow. 1778.-There were frost and snow at the beginning of the year; the beginning of April was fine. The summer was fine and hot, supposed at the time to have been as fine a summer as that of 1762, if not as fine as the summer of 1750. Frosty mornings began in September but were less frequent afterwards. On the last day of this year there was a violent storm, supposed by some to have been as violent as that of 1703. 1779.-After the beginning of January there was no frost; the spring months were remarkably warm. In February wall fruit flowered; the middle of April was quite hot, as was the summer and autumn; about the middle of November there was a little frost, and again on December 22: there was much sickness this year. 1780.-This year began with a frost almost as severe as that in 1772; there was not much snow, and the weather continued severe till near the end of February. The month of March was warm; it was hot from July to September, and mostly mild till Christmas, when a frost set in. The year was sickly. 1781.-There was a little frost at the beginning of the year; the spring was mild, the summer was hot, and the ground was much burned. Autumn was fine and pleasant, and there were only a few frosty mornings during the remainder of the year. 1782.-The beginning of the year was mild, but in February it was frosty, and the remainder of the winter was severe; the spring was cold; nearly 12 inches of rain fell in April and May; the weather was fine in June, but bad afterwards; the autumn was cold; it was severe in November, and during the first half of December. 1783.-The spring was pleasant, with frosty mornings very constant till near April. A remarkable haze was prevalent all over Europe during the summer. The autumn was fine, and the weather was mostly mild till the last week in December, when a great fall of snow took place. 1784.--There was steady frost with snow till February 21, and till the end of March the mornings were frosty; and at the end of March there were cold winds with snow. This weather continued till the middle of April; and till the first week in May frosty mornings were fiequent, and the remainder of May was exceedingly hot. There THE ROYAL SOCIETY, AND AT THE ROYAL OBSERVATORY, GREENWICH. 587 were a few hot days in July, but the weather was precarious throughout the autumn; and in December the frost was as severe as it was in January. 1785.-The severe frost of the preceding month broke early in January, but on the last day of that month a second very severe frost set in and continued till the middle of March. This winter was most severe. The summer and part of autumn were showery; a heavy fall of snow took place at Christmas, with severe frost. 1786.-The frosts at the beginning of the year were of short duration. From the beginning of March there was a severe frost of a fortnight's duration, and cold E. and N.E. winds were prevalent with frosty mornings till the beginning of May. June and July were moderately fine; August was cold and showery; and from this time to the end of the year there was a great deal of rain. 1787.-The year began with open weather. April was cold with N. winds, and vegetation was stopped; during April and May frosty mornings were frequent, and there was a sharp frost on the morning of the 7th of June; it was a cold summer; the autumn was mild, and there was a heavy fall of snow and a week's frost at the end of the year. 1788.-January and February were mild, the latter month being wet; there was a fortnight's frost in March; there were several periods of hot weather in April, May and June. The summer was in general dry; autumn was fine; there wasa gentle frost at the beginning of December, then an exceedingly severe frost set in with heavy falls of snow, which continued to the end of the year. This year was remarkable for abundance of fruits &c. 1789.-Very heavy storms of wind and snow took place till the middle of January; and large rivers were frozen over; there was a great loss of fish in ponds from the severity of the cold. After the frost broke the weather was mild, but windy and wet. During March there were nearly constant N. winds, and heavy falls of snow were frequent with sharp frost. The summer was mostly wet; August was fine, after which it was again wet, and continued so to the end of the year, with scarcely any frost. 1790.-The weather was mild and open till April, when the first snow fell in the year, and the weather, during the beginning of this month, was the most severe during the winter. The summer was cool, cloudy and windy; autumn was fine and pleasant; December was stormy with very changeable weather. 1791.-Till January 6th there was frost; after this the weather was mild till towards the end of April; there were many frosty mornings with cold N.E. winds in May. The former part of the summer was cold; frosty mornings were frequent till the middle of June, the latter part of summer and autumn. During November and December there were frequent storms and falls of snow and frost. 1792.-There were frequent sharp frosts till March, with stormy and wet weather; the beginning of March was mild, after this there was a frost of a week's durations The summer was wet and cold; the autumn was wet, and December was cloudy, with very little frost. This year was very wet. 4rF2 588 MR. GLAISHER ON THE THERMOMETRICAL OBSERVATIONS TAKEN AT 1793.-January and February and beginning of March were nild; a frost set in at the end of March; there was a great fall of snow in the first week in April. The former part of the summer was cold, with frequent frosty mornings till June; July was wet; the autumn was fine, mild and calm, and therea was no frost till the end of the year. 1794.-Trhe year began with slight frost, which continued till the end of January;I February was very mild; the spring was warm till May, which was cold; July was hot; the autumn was wet but mild, as was the first part of December, but the weather during the latter half of the month was severe with heavy snow. 1795.-The frost began about the middle of December 1794, was excessively severe in January, and continued till the end of March. There were very large falls of snow, and the consequent floods were so great that nearly all the bridges in England were injured. Some snow fell in April. The summer was cold, with frequent frosty mornings till June; there were some hot days in July, but it was generally cold; after this the weather was fine till autumn. In December much injury was done to shipping by the strong S. and S.W. winds; there was no frost. 1796.-January was remarkably warm, with occasional thunder-storms; there was no frost till March, and then of no long duration. The summer was cool; the autumn was fine with a few frosty mornings at the end of November; in December a severe frost set in, and the reading of the thermometer in many places on the 24th was below zero of FAHRENHEIT'S scale. 1797.-During a few days in January the frost continued; after this, till the end of March, scarcely any rain fell, and the weather was fine with frequent frost. From April to September there were frequent heavy rains. The summer was cold; there was some warm weather in July; the autumn in general fine, and the weather continued open till the end of the year. 1798.-With the exception of a few slight frosts, which occasionally occurred till March, the weather was open and mild. The summer was fine, as was autumn and the beginning of December ; after this a very severe frost set in, and the reading of the thermometer was as low as 5O. 1799.-The severe frost which set in about the middle of the preceding month continued to the middle of January, and again set in towards the end of the month with much snow, which continued during the first week in February; some Snow fell in March, and the mornings were frosty till the end of the month. From April to the middle of November was wet; December was foggy; and after the 17th a severe frost set in with snow falling. The whole year was remarkably cloudy. If we compare the character of the preceding years with the abnormal differences shown for the samne year s in Table XX. the agreement is most satisfactory and leaves no doubt upon the correctness of the numbers at the beginning of this series. I do not think it necessary to describe the years from that of 1800, as most of them are well described by LUKE HOWARD in his '-Climate of Londonr .

These numbers do not at all confirm the idea that a hot summer is either preceded or followed by a cold winter, or vice versd; on the contrary, it would see n that anyhot or cold period has been mostly accompanied by weather of the same character. The cold year of 1771 was followed by two cold years. The hot year of 1779 was preceded by one warm year and followed by two others. In 178f) the extreme cold -of January was more than counterbalanced by the extreme heat of March. The cold year of 1782 was followed by a long series of cold years. The very cold year of 1799 was followed by a cold autumn and winter. The warm, year of 1806 was preceded by a warm winter. rThe very cold year of 1814 (the last very cold year we have had) was preceded by a cold summer, autumn and winter. The hot, vear of 1818 'as preceded by a mnoderate winter, and was followed by a warm one. The hot year of 1822 was preceded by a warm winter and was followed by a moderately cold one. The hot ycar of 1 834 followed a very m ild vinter and was followedI by another. The hot THE ROYAL SOCIETY, AND AT THE ROYAL OBSERVATORY, GREENWICH. 593 year of 1846 was preceded by a warin winter and was followed by a moderate one. The warrn year 1848 was both preceded and followed by warm periods. The mean temperatures of the years 1771, 1782) 1784, 1786, 1799 and 1814, were all below 460; the coldest was 1784, and its value was 450?1. The mean temperatures of the years 1779, 1818, 1822, 1834 and 1846, were all above 500-5; the year of highest temperature was 1846, and its value was 510.3. Thus seventy-nine years, from 1771 to 1849 inclusive, gives a mean temperature of 480.3, with a variation, between one year and another, from 450.1 in 1784 to 51?03 in 1846; the difference is 60.2.

THE ROYAL SOCIETY, AND AT THE ROYAL OBSERVATORY, GREEN wiCH. 607 The subjects of this paper are the determination of mean numerical values and the establishment of the laws of periodic variation from the long series of observations which were taken under the direction of this Society, combined with that still being made at Greenwich. I have not attempted to deduce any rules for non-periodic variations. It is most fortunate that through all reports this series of observations continued unbroken for so many years, and that it did not cease till that at Greenwich had been in operation for two or three years. The number of observations treated of in this paper exceeds 200,000, spread nearly equally over seventy-nine years, and the results generally are important additions to science. I consider the determination of the mean temperature at Greenwich as a real addition; 'it is probably the best determination of this element of any spot on the globe, and it will help to an accurate knowledge of the mean temperature of its surface. I may however here remark, that none of the mean results in this paper could have been calculated if observations at equal intervals had not been taken throughout the twenty-four hours and continued for a few years. The observations at Greenwich have supplied this want. It was upon them, taken for five years, I based my determinations of curve of hourly mean temperature, and by this means have made all the observations available. As it is difficult to have instruments read more frequently than twice or thrice in a day, yet, to make these available, it is necessary that the laws of diurnal changes of temperature be known; and where such is riot the case, an effort should be made in all countries to have a series of hourly or bi-hourly observations made for a few years, so as to be able to deduce useful results. Such series of frequent observations need not be made near each other, as it is found that the observations made over a considerable extent of country are subject to the same general laws.
