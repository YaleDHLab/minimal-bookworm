[385] XXI. Determination of the Longitudes and Latitudes of some remarkable Places near the Severn. In a Letter from Edward Pigott, Esq. to Sir Henry C. Englefield, Bart. F. R. S. Read May 30, 1790. AS perhaps this Paper may be thought of some use, I beg you will do me the favour of presenting it to the Royal Society. Its principal object is to settle the longitude and latitude of several remarkable places near the Severn, the relative distances of which I measured trigonometrically during my stay in Glamorganshire. As they are all deduced from Frampton-house, it is requisite to determine the position of that place with correctness. My father has already given its longitude in the Philosophical Transactions, Vol. LXXI. being the mean of several observations of Jupiter's first and second satellites. From the known ability of the observer, we may undoubtedly depend that all possible exactness was obtained, of which those observations are susceptible; but at that time the superior accuracy of the lunar transits was not known; therefore at present there can be no hesitation in giving the preference to the following results.

This method of determining terrestrial longitudes I have fully detailed in the Philosophical Transactions, Vol. LXXVI. and still think it cannot be too strongly recommended. The preceding additional set of results do further corroborate the reliance that may be put on it, though the observations were not made with that intention, and consequently several of them are deficient in many particulars: their agreement, nevertheless, is conclusive, and infinitely more satisfactory than could be expected. Since the above-mentioned publication I have been informed, that M. le Marquis DE CHABERT and others, many years ago, settled differences of meridians on similar principles, and I dare say with as much sagacity as the then imperfect state of the method would permit. At present it is certainly considerably improved, being susceptible of very great exactness and facility, which perhaps may be considered as the sole requisites for rendering it any wise useful. The latitude of the same place, taken with an 18-inch quadrant made by BIRD, is thus by my observations: E e e 2 51 388 Mr. PIGOTT'S Determination of the Longitudes and o ' '' 51 25 0 by ~ Geminorum. 51 24 50 by ~ Bootis; two observations. 51 25 5 by ~ Sagittarii. 51 25 13 by ~ Virginis. 51 24 55 by ~ Bootis; two observations. 51 24 48 by ~ Delphini. 51 24 56 by Fomalhaut. 51 24 58 + on a mean. ditto, by my father, with the same instrument. 51 25 1 See Phil.

I measured the same base three times by different methods, 2046 the results were 2042 feet. As the view from its extremities 2042 was very confined, another base of 1861 yards was deduced from it, situated on the high lands that edge the Severn, having a very extensive and beautiful prospect. From the extremities of this second base, all the angles were taken with a tolerably good theodolite on which two minutes might be easily read off. The results here given are the distances from the various places to the western extremity of their base, their perpendicular distances to its meridian, and its distance from these perpendiculars.

The direct distances are the most accurate, the others being affected according to the exactness of the meridian of the west extremity of the base; the direction of which was found by the variation needle, its declination having been determined at Frampton-house, and therefore sufficiently correct; for an error in that angle, even of half a degree, would make a difference of a very few seconds in any of the places observed.

The names of the places here set down were pointed out to me by persons who seemed well acquainted with the surrounding country. The breadth of the Severn at that part where I took the angles is about 121/9 miles. However coarse these trigonometrical operations may appear, when compared to those made so scientifically, and with such wonderful exactness, in the southern parts of the kingdom, they nevertheless settle the geographical situations of the given places with more precision than is usually obtained, even from a series of astronomical observations. Perhaps some gentlemen in the north of Devonshire or Somersetshire may be induced to continue similar operations, when they consider with what little trouble they may be made, as the distances between any of the towns I have determined may suffice for a base.
