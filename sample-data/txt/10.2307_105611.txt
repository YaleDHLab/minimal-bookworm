XXXIV. Observations on the Transit of Venus, June the 6th, 1761, made in SpitalSquare; the Longitude of which is 4~ 11~ West of the Royal Observatory at Greenwich, and the Latitude 51~ 31~ 15~ North; by John. Canton, M. A. and F. R. S. HAving measured the diameter of Venus, on the sun, three times, with the object-glass micrometer, the mean was found to be 58 seconds; and but 6/10 of a second, the difference of the extremes *. Read Nov. 5, 1761. * With the same micrometer, the diameter of Venus was measured, off the sun, twelve times, March the 29th, 1758, about noon; and the mean was 1~ 1~ 42~; whence the diameter, at the time of the transit, ought, by computation, to have been 1~ 0~ 19~.

The time, by the clock, of the internal 8 17 4 contact, was Of the external contact 8 35 27 Of noon 11 58 241/2 Therefore the apparent time of the first 8 18 41 contact, was Of the last contact 8 37 4 The two positions of Venus on the sun's disc, [Vide Tab. VI.] in chords parallel to the equator, were determined by frequently measuring the parts of such chords on each side the centre of the planet, with the object-glass micrometer; which was done with difficulty, both on account of the clouds, and the telescope's not having an equatorial motion. Let the arc A T B represent a part of the sun's limb; let C F D be parallel to it, at the distance of a semidiameter of Venus; and let O V X and P V Y be parallel to the equator. At 7h 14m 39s A. M. apparent time, O V was 14~ 43~, and V X 5~ 32~. At 7h 57m 21s, P V was 16~ 36~, and V Y 1~ 56~. These observations were all made with a reflecting telescope of 18 inches focal length, which magnified about 55 times. XXXV. Some
