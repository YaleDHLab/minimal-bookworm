X. A total Eclipse of the Moon, observed Dec. 2, 1750. in the Morning in the Strand, London, about 5'' of Time West of St. Paul's, and 27'' West of the Royal Observatory at Greenwich; by Dr. Bevis and Mr. James Short F.

These Observations were made with a reflecting Telescope, that magnified 40 times, and a refracting Telescope, which magnified 12 times; and the Times were the same thro' these two Telescopes; for the Air was exceeding clear, and the Shadow well defined, the Penumbra being scarce sensible. Here 1 [577] Here follows a Computation, made from Dr. Halley's Tables, by Mr. John Catlin, of Guy's Hospital; and sent to Mr. Short the Day before the Eclipse. h ' '' Dec. 1. in the Morning 1750.
