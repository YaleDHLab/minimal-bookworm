L420 ,4 XXI. On the Declhnations of some of tihe principalfted S/ars-wzith a Descrzption ofr an Astronomncal Circle, and some Remarkes on the Construction of Circular Instruments. By John Pond, Esq. Communicated by Smithson Tennant, Elsq. F. R. S. Read June 26, i8oG6 TrHE observations which accompany this Paper were made at Westbury in Somersetshire, in the years i8oo and 18oi, with an Astronomical Circle of two feet and a half diameter, constructed by Mr. TROUGHTON, and considered by hi'm as one of the best divided instruments he had ever made a drawing of it, with a short description, is annexed to the obhservations. (Plate XX.) When this instrument -came into my possession, I thought I could not employ it in a more advantageous manner, than in endeavouring to determine the declinations of some of the principal fixed stars-.* The various catalogues differed so much from each other, and such doubt existed as to the accuracy of those which were thought most perfect; that the declinations of few stars could be considered as sufficiently well ascertained for the more accurate purposes of astronomy. The advantages that have resulted from the excellent method pursued at Greenwich, of observing constantly the transits of a fewv stars to obtain accurately their 'right ascent sions, induced meto follow the same method for determining At that time Dr. MASKELYN E'S late Catalogue was not published. Mr. POND On the Declinations, &c. 421 their declinations-; and for a (considerable period I constantly observed them on the meridian, whenever they passed at a convenient hour; usually reversing the instrument in azimuth at the end of every davy's observation; never considering any observation as complete that had anot its corresponding one in a short interval of time. When this circumstance is not ate tended to, I think, a great part of the advantage arising from the circular construction is lost. The observations themselves will show, if they have been made with the requisite care and attention to merit the notice of astronomers; for it is one of the many advantages of circular instruments, t1aat from the observations made with them, we may infer with great precision not only the mean probable error, but liikewise the greatest possible error to which they are liable. From a careful cormparison of the errors of collimation, as deduced from different stars, I coneluded that the greatest possible error was 2",S, and the mean error about 1!'; and by a comparison with other observations with similar instruments, it will be seen that this supposition was well founded, Since nearly the same quantities are deduced by another method to be considered hereafter. The polar distances are annexed to each observation: a method which I borrowed from Mr. WOLLASTON, and which is rendered very easy by employing his useful tables calculated for that purpose. This practice of reducing every day's observations cannot be too much recommended, as the labour of calculating accumulated observations is thus rendered unnecessary. When I had deduced the declinations of these stars from mny own observations, continued long enough to divest them V2} Mr: POND on the Declinations of all error, except that arising from defect in the divisions of the intrument, I was desirous of comparing them with the observations made by others; and I have subjoined a comn parison of them with all those which I could procure, that seemed entitled to confidence. In the first column are the observations made at Greenwich, as published in i8o2 by the Astronomer Royal; the second column contains a catalogue deduced from somle observations made at Armagrh with a very large equatorial instrument constructed by Mr.TROouGI--TON . In the third column are the observations of Mr. PIAZZI, Of Palermo; and in the fourth those made at Westbury. All the above mentioned observations are arranged in the order of their polar distances, and the positive deviations separated from the negative; that the cause of error in any of the instruments may be the more easily detected, as likewise any mistake in the assumed latitudes of the respective places of observation. A general catalogue is then added; which is deduced, by taking the mean, generally of the above four; but in some places, a few detached observations that I have accidentally procured of other circular instruments have been included. The utility of this investigation is not merely confined to the determination of the polar distances of the stars; as besides this some valuable information on other points may be obtained. In the first place, upon examining the variations that appear in these observations a question naturally occurs, whether, by changing the assumed latitudes of the respective places of observation, a nearer coincidence might not be obtained. And I find, that to make the positive deviations equal to the negative, the following corrections should be applied it{) the co-latitudes. of some of'the prnbcipalfixed Stars' &cV. 423 Greenwich + 1"8 Armagh + 1",3 Palermoill Westbury -O",25 This method of correcting the latitudes has, I believe, never been employed: but it seems reasonable to suppose, that when thus corrected, they will be nearer the truth, than those determined by the usual method: for the same reason, that -the-declinations of the stars resulting from a general comparison, are more likely to be accurate, than if deduced from any one single set of observations: but if the Greenwich instrument should be affected with any errors independent of the-divisions; in that case, we should be unable to infer any thing decisive, as to the latitude, by the above method. But from a comparison of the observations of y Draconis, observed at Greenwich and Westbury, the latitude of Westbury being -previously corrected by the above method, I am inclined to believe the latitude of Greenwich requires a very small cora rection, certainly not exceeding a second. The result I obtain by a very careful investigation by methods, entirely independent of the Greenwich quadrant, is 51?'8'.3g-',4. ; I consider this comparison as interesting likewise on another account ; it is an object deserving of curiosity to examine the present state of our best astronomical instruments and to ascertain what may reasonably be expected from thei. The superiority of circular instruments is, I believe, too universally admitted, to render it probable that quadrants will ever again be substituted in their place. But the Greenwich quadrant is so intimately connected with the history of astronomy, the observations that have been made with it, and the deductions MDCCC VI. 8 I 4Gus Mr. PoND on t Decinations from those observations, are of such infinite importance to the science, that every circumstance relating to it cannot fail of' being interesting. Now when it is considered that this instrumernt has been in constant use for upwards of half a century, and that the center error, from constant friction, would during this time have a regular tendency to increase, it vill not appear at all surprising, if the former accuracy of this instrut ment should be somewhatimpaired. With a view; therefore, of ascertaining more correctly the present state of an instrument on which so much depends, I have exhibited in one view the polar distances as determined by circular instruments alone; the respective co-latitudes being previously corrected by the method above mentioned, and I have compared the mean result with the Greenwich Catalogue, that the nature and amount of the deviations may be seen, and if it be judged necessary, corrected. I should add, that by -some observations of the sun at the winter solstice in i8o, the difference between the Greenwich quadrant and the circle was otor 12", the quadrant still giving the zenith distance too little. General Descrl2tian of the Instrument. The annexed Plate represents th e circle in its vertical position. It was originally made to be used likewise as an equatorial instrument, a circumstance I need not have meanl tioried, but as an apology for the slightness of its construction, which the artist who made it would not have reommended, had the instrument been intended for the vertical position only. The declination circle, 30 inches in diameter, is composed of two complete circles; the coical radii of which are inserted of some of the princiaialfixed Stars, &c. 425 at theirl bases in an axis about i 2 inches long, leaving sufficient space between the limbs for a telescope 31 feet long, and an aperture of 23 inches, to pass between. The two circles are firmly united at their extreme borders by a great number of bars, which stand perpendicular between them; the whole of which will be readily understood by referring to the figure. The square frames, which appear as inscribed in the circle, were added to give additional firmness to the whole. The circle is divided by fine lines into A' of a degree; and subdivided into single seconds by two micrometer microscopes, the principles and properties of which are now too well known to require any particular explanation. At the time these observations were made, the microscopes were firmly fixed opposite to the horizontal diameter: but when I considered that, by -continuing the observations, the error of division would never be diminished, I suggested to Mr. TROuGHTON the possibility of giving a circular motion to the microscopes, though I confess with very little hope, that the thing was really practicable in an instrument previously constructed on other principles. Mr. TROUGHTON approved of the idea, and executed it in a very ingenious manner. His talents, as an artist, are too well known and too highly appreciated, to stand in need of any praise from me; yet I should consider myself as deficient in justice, if I did not endeavour to call the attention of the reader to the skill and ingenuity, which have been employed not only in this very important alteration, but in every contrivance that is peculiar to the instrument, which is the object of our present consideration.-These microscopes can now revolve about 60? from their s32 426 Mr. POND onf-the Declinations horizontal position; and it is easy to comprehend, that by' this valuable improvemelnt, all errors of division may -be completely done away, without any of the manifest inconveniences of the French circle of repetition; which, though a very ingenious instrument, and admirably adapted to someparticular operations, will, I think, never be adopted for general use in our observatories. The plumb-line, a very material part of this instrument, is suspended from a small hookat the top of the tube at the left hand of the figure. It passes through an angle,in which it rests in the same manner as the pivot of a transit instrument does on its support. At the lower end of -the tube which protects it, a smaller tube is fixed at right angles, which contains microscopic glasses so contrived, that the image of a luminous point, like the disc of a planet, is formed on the plumbline and bisected by it. Great attention should be given to the accurate bisection of this transparent point by the plumb-line at the moment of observation. It is absolutely essential in instrumlents of this construction to consider the observation, as consisting in two bisections at the same time: the one of thee star by the micrometer, the other of the plumb-line-point by the plumb-line. The least negligence in either of these bisec-tions will render the observation unsuccessful. The two strong pillars, which support the axis of the vertical circle, are firmly united at their bases to a cross bar; to which also the long vertical axis is affixed, and which may be considered as forming one piece with them. The stone, pedestal is hollow, and contains a brass conical socket, fi rrmly fastened to the stone, and reaching almost to the ground. This socket receives the vertical axis, and supports the whole of some of the pnncz)ia1 fixed Stars, &c. 47 weight of the moveable part of the instrument, which revolves on an obtuse point at the bottom the upper part of this vertical axis is kept steady in a right angle, having two springs opposite the points of contact, which press it against' its bearings, and-it thus turns in these four points of contact with a very pleasant and steady motion. The bar, in which the vertical axis-is thus centered, is acted on by two adjusting screws in directions at right angles, and perfectly independent of each other, By these motions, the axis may be set as truly perpendicular, as by the usual method of the tripod with feet screws, which could not in this case have been employed. The frame, to which this apparatus is attached, is fixed to the corners of the hexagonal stone, by the conical tubes between which and the stone, the azimuth circle (which forms one piece with the vertical axis) turns freely. The azimuth circle of two feet diameter consists of eight conical tubes, inserted in the vertical axis and which are united at their ends by the circular limb ; this is divided and read off exactly in a similar manner to the other circle. A level remains constantly suspended on the horizontal axis, which is verified in the same manner as in a transit instrurment. There are fbrcing screws for' this purpose, which pass through the bar on which the vertical columns stand, and these by pressing against the long axis produce a small change in the inclination of the upper part of the instrument without altering the position of the azimuth circle or it& axis. The application of the plumb-line, as already described, is 428 Mr. PowDn on theDeclinations peculiar to the instruments made by Mr TROtUGHTO.N: it; regards the vertical axis rather than any other part, and is. in fact, exactly analogous to the usual verification of I a zenith sector. During the period in which I was engaged in, making ob. servations with circular instruments, I was led to consider the advantages and inconveniences of the usual method of adjusts ing them ; and it appeared to me, that the essential part of their construction, which relates to their adjustment, was capable of being improved. In order to render the nature of the improvement, which I wish to propose, more intelligible, I ought previously to remark, that there are, at present in use, two modes of adjusting these instruments, which are founded on different principles.In the one, two points are taken on the limb of the circle ; and when these are brought into a given position, by means of a plumb-line passing over them, the microscope or index is made to coincide with the zero point of the divisions: by this method, the error in collimation remains constant; and, if the adjustment is by any accident deranged, it can easily be rectified, and there will be no absolute necessity for frequently reversing the instrument; so that this method seems well adapted for large instruments, particularly if placed on stone piers. But it is liable to this defect, that the adjustment cannot be examined at the moment of observation; and if any change should take place in the general position of the frame work, the observation will be erroneous without the means of detection. It was probably to avoid this inconvenience, that of some of the prnczbpalfixed Stars, &c. 9 Mr. TROUGHTON, in most of his instruments, particularly if they were intended to move freely inhazimuth, has preferred the other method. In this case, the plumb-lin e is attached to one of the pillars which support the microscopes in the way above described;and it has no reference to any fixed poins or divisions on the limb of the circle, but only insures a similarity of position in7 the index, for each position of the instrument; and, provided that the plumb-line apparatus was free from all danger of derangemen t, this would he sufficient.e This verification may be rendered perhaps more intelligible, by considering that a circular instrument, in whatever manner its vertical axis be placed, indicates Bby a double observation, the angle which the object makes with the axis, round which the whole instrument has revolvued in passing from one positionQ to the -p other. For let Pp be the axis, Tx the. telescope xY<y in one position; -it is evident, that in turning the instrumen, t half round, ty will then be the position t of the telescope,: Px being equal to Py. The arc P xy, which the telescope passes through to regain its former position, is the quantity really given by the instrument; and if the axis Pp be vertical, half this quantity is the true zenith distance of the object. Now the intention of Mr. TROUGHTON'S verification is to insure a vertical position to the axis Pp. For instruments which rest on moveable pillars, and turn freely in azimuth, this method is much to be preferred; but It is not without a considerable defect: for, if by any derange. ment in the plumb-line apparatus, the error in collinmation be changed, it cannot be restored with certain y to its former poD sition; so that sometimes a veryvaluable series -of observations 430 Mr:. POND on the Delinations may be lost, for want of a corresponding one to compare with it. The mode which I propose to adopt to remedy these incon veniences, will enable us to combine all the advantages of the two methods above described: it is extremely simple 'in its principle, and easy of execution, for it merely consists in uniting on the same plumb-line the two principles already explained.' Two very fine holes should be made in the farther limb of the circle, and two lenses firmly fixed opposite to them, in the other, which should each form aan optical image of its corresponding dot or hole, in the tube through which the plumb-line passes.* It will be best, if these dots are. made exactly in a diameter, as they may then be used in two positions. Beneath these should be formed the image of a luminous point, according to Mr. TROUGHTON'S present method, by an apparatus attached to the plumb-line tube; when the two points on the circle move away, by the necessary operation in observing, the lower point will remain stationary, and indicate any change of position in the whole instrument,, if such should accidentally take place, and which by the other method alone would have passed unnoticed. The contrivance above described was executed for me at, my request by Mr. TROUGITON, and is represented in the Plate; but by some accident a part of -the apparatus was * As these transparent dots are intended to be bisected by the plumbline, they must be capable of the necessary adjustments, both for distinct vision, and for placing them in an exact diameter. It may be found more convenient in practice to arrange the whole apparatus in -iiding tubes, but in whatever way the contrivance be executed, the points should ultimately be fixed as firmly asthe divisions of the instrument. of some of the princ:palf xed Stars, &c. 431 broken in putting it together so that I never was able to use it. As each apparatus for this adjustment is quite independent of the other, no possible inconvenience can attend their appli cation, as either maybe employed alone, at the option of the observer. But as any verification requiring many bisections is objectionable, I would in general certainly prefer Mr. TROUGHTON'S method, and only have recourse to the other, when there was reason to suspect that some alteration had taken place to render it necessary. One more circumstance respecting the instrument remains to be noticed: when the divisions were first examined by opposite readings, ",e was the greatest possible error which was to be apprehended, and o",7 the mean error; but in its journey it seemed to have suffered some very small derangement in its form: this was discernible both from examining the opposite readings; and by deducing the error of collimation by zenith stars, and comparing it with that found by an horizontal object, there was constantly perceived a diffeArence of A" between the error of collimation deduced from , Draconis and by an horizontal obj ect; and this quantity was very uniformly distributed through the intermediate arc., In what particular manner the. observations would be affected by this derangement I will not venture to decide, but I think it most likely that it has only rendered the instrument rather less accurate than it was originally, as is above stated. I have before observed the great advantage the circle possesses of showing the amount of its own errors. These may be determined with great certainty by examining the errors of collitnation as deduced from different stars. This method is founded upon the supposition that half the difference of the two. extreme MDCCCVI. 3K 432 Mr. POND on the Declinationsquantities is the greatest error of division, which has in this case influenced each result in an opposite direction. For instance, let us suppose the errors of division never to exceed 2", but occasionally to amount to that quantity, on several parts of the circle; it will then sometimes occur that each index will give 2" too much in one position of the instrument, and 2" too little in the other; there will then appear a diffie-. rence of A" in the error of collimation; but the observations in these extreme cases will not on that account be the less to be depended on; on the contrary, the probability is in favour of their superior accuracy. Nor, on the other hand, will those observations which give the mean error of collimation deserve greater confidence than the rest, since it is evident that some of them may be, and most probably are, affected with the greatest possible error; for we suppose the most erroneous observation to arise from the greatest error of division occurring on each of the four arcs in the same sense, that is all plus or all mzinus; nevertheless, the observation thus erroneous, will give the mean error of collimation. By an attentive consideration of these circumstances, corrections might perhaps be obtained which would somewhat diminish the probability of error. But it is to the principle of the revolving microscopes, that in the future construction of instruments we should look for perfection. In the French circle of repetition, too great a sacrifice is made to the supposed advantage of reading off a great number of observations at once. Our best instruments are too well constructed to stand-in need of this contrivance, as the divisions on a twofeet circle are read off with precision to a single second. of some of the principalfixed Stars, &c. 433 The errors of simple division alone are those which continued observations have no tendency to dininish; these, by making the microscopes revolve, may be completely done away. An instrument thus constructed would be well adapted to detect small motions in the fixed stars which hitherto have escaped notice, or such as are but imperfectly known for we cannot reasonably conclude that what is termed the proper motion of a star is so uniform and constant, that being once determined, it will remain always the same. In the following observations, the larger number expresses the altitude, + go, and the smaller number the zenith distance; the thermometer was attached to the telescope. In reducing the observations of iSo 1, the proper motions are allowed for, according to the latest tables of Dr. MASKELYNE. K 2 434 Mr. POND on the Declinations y Pegasi.
