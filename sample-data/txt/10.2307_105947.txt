[203] XXII. Observations on the Heat of the Bath and Bristol Water, by Mr. John Canton, A. M. F. R. S. Bath, Sept. 2, O. S. or the 13th N. S. 1752. AFTER pumping about 1/4 of an hour, a Fahrenheit's thermometer, held in the stream from the common pump of the king's bath, was raised to 112~. The stream from the common pump of the hot bath raised it to 114~~. At the pump of the cross bath, it stood at 110~. At noon, the heat of the shaded air was 66~, and of common water exposed to it 61~. I found the bath water, and common water, brought to the same degree of heat, to cool equally fast. The next day, Sept. 14, I was at the hot-well near Bristol, the water of which raised the thermometer to 76~. In common water exposed to the shaded air it stood at 62~. Read July 3, 1767. J. Canton.
