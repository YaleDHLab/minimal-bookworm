An Extract of a Letter from Mr. William Stevenson to Benj. Hoadly, M. D. F. R. S. Containing an Account of an Observation of an Eclipse of the Moon, on July 29, 1729, made in Barbados by Mr. Stevenson's Brother. ` H E took care to regulate a very good Clock, and ` brought it to true Time about 14 Days ` before the Eclipse. On the Day it happened, he ` saw the Sun set, and found the Clock right, accord` ing to the mean Time, Refraction allowed. At the ` Beginning of the Eclipse, the Moon was clouded. ` At 7 H. 18 M. (in the Evening) apparent Time, ` he saw the Moon 2 Digits Eclipsed, about 30 Degr. 1 ` to (441) ` to the left of its Nadir-Point. At 8 H. 11 M. she ` totally immerged into the Earth's Shadow, about ` 30 Degr. to the right Hand of her Vertical Point. ` At 9 H. 51 M. she emerged out of the Shadow, ` 79 or 80 Degr. to the left of her Nadir-Point. At ` 10 H. 50 M. the Eclipse ended, 88 Degr. to the ` right of her Vertical Point. In this, and all the ` other Observations he made of both Solar and Lunar ` Eclipses, during several Years he has been in Barba` dos, he found that they always happened 10 Mi` nutes sooner than his Computation. Whence he con` cludes, that that Island lies 2 Degr. and a Half ` more Westerly than is generally supposed.' III.
