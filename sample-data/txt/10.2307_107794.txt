PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS. Observations of the apparent distances and positions of 458 double and triple Stars, made in the years 1823, 1824, and 182 25 together with a re-examination of 36 Stars of the same description, the distances andpositions of which were communicated in a former Memoir. By JAMES SOUTH, Esq. F. R. S. Read November 17, 1825. H E Royal Society having honoured the observations of s8o double and triple stars made by Mr. HERSCHEL and myself with a place in the Philosophical Transactions, I am induced to offer for the like distinction a fresh series. The Equatorial Instruments and Micrometers used on the present occasion, being precisely the same as those with which the preceding observations were made, the prefatory matter attached to the former communication, will be generally applicable to this. As however some of the results have been obtained in England, and others in France, the place where each series of measures was procured, accompanies the date and instrumient of observation. From the srd of April, 1825, to the demolition of the Observatory at Passy, the micrometer of the Five-feet Equatorial was applied to the Seven-feet Instrument, in order to MDCCCXXVI. b PI Mr. SOUTH'S observations of the apparent distances obtain the advantage of higher magnifying powers. By this change they stand in order,92, 157, 1,81, 327, 413, 513, and 787; the commonly used power being 18t: a rigorous examination assured me, that the value of the one micrometer, was also the value of the other. In the subsequent pages will be found observations of about i6o double and triple stars, hitherto (as far as I know) undiscovered: their apparent right ascensions and declinations are, I hope, generally accurate to the nearest minute: and should occasionally a greater error be detected, some indulgence will I trust be extended to me, for they were generally found at a considerable distance from the meridian, when extreme unsteadiness of the stars, and unwillingness to quit my observatory, rendered sweeping for new double stars my only mode of passing the night in it: as however they have been found on subsequent evenings froni the data here given, no difficulty in identifying them, can reasonably be expected. In the former Paper, A7 double and triple stars were selected as entitled to peculiar notice, these it was my inten;tion to have subjected individually to a rigid investigation ; owing-however. to the almost.unprecedented bad weather of the last autumnal and winteri months, so only of them could be re-measured; and the observations, which are here sub.joined.as an Appendix,although.not.so complete* as I could have wished, will still I hope be deemed not unimportant. Trhe arrangement is somewhat different from that pursued on the former occasion: instead of individual measures being * The Appendix contains observations of thirty-six stars; six however of them offer no particular interest, and were measured inadvertently, under an idea that they were unmeasured stars. and positions of 4,58 double and triple stars, &c. 3 presented to public view, the mean result of each night's work is here noted; but as the number of -observations, and the differences between the extreme measures of each series are also specified, it is hoped that the alteration will be satisfactory to the Society. As in these observations I have not had the powerful aid of Mr. HERSCHEL, it has been my endeavour as far as possible to compensate for the loss; hence, instead of taking ten individual observations both of distance and position on the same night, and thereby considering the star measured, I have divided the work generally assigned to each star between two evenings, the better -to correct any error which unfavourable state of atmosphere, inaccurate micrometrical readings, or particular bias of judgment might entail; and when the results have exhibited discordances greater than seemed justified by the difficulty of the observations, a third, or even a fourth night's determination has been found useful. To the observations contained in the former Memoir, peculiar interest was attached by the comparison of them with the results obtained by other astronomers; of which by far the most important were those derived from the labours of Sir W. HERSCHEL; but as the observations which are recorded in the Philosophical Transactions are (from circumstances before * adverted to) of themselves inadequate to furnish the final results arrived at by that illustrious astronomer, it is grateful to me, and doubtless will also be to the Society, that the kindness of Mr. HERSCHEL has supplied the necessary information; thus the existence of fresh connected systems is substantiated, and adegree of present importance conferred on the following pages, which he alone could bestow.* See Phil. Trans. for i82-+, Part Ill. page 2o. 4 Mr. SOUTH'S observations of the apparent distances The noble liberality of the Russian Government having recently put Mr. STRUVE in possession of an instrument much more powerful, and far more appropriate, for pursuing this department of astronomical* enquiry, than those with which his published observations were made, I have not deemed it right, as heretofore, to refer to his earlier, yet still valuable determinations, the general accuracy of which may well be cited as proofs of what industry and perseverance may achieve, although supported by comparatively slender instrumental assistance. I have said that the accompanying observations were made partly at home, and partly abroad; the latter remind me of a pleasing duty:-the Board of Longitude of Paris, and Government of France, have claims upon me too great to remain unnoticed, the one for having requested, and the other for having acceded to me the permission of introducing into France, free of all duty (sans conditions), whatever astronomical instruments I thought proper ;t and so effectual were the arrangements of the Director General of the * The investigation of parallax by direct observations of double stars, not having yet been seriously entered upon, although recommended by Sir W. HERSCHEL nearly fifty years ago, and the importance of it having been warmly pressed upon me by MONSIEUR LE MARQUIS DE LA PLAcE-a continuous series of observations of the most interesting double and triple stars seeming necessary-and fresh determinations of the orbits of Saturn's satellites being wanted-it was my wish to have procured more extensive means than I possess, to have. attacked the one, to have with greater facility followed up the other, and to have furnished the necessary observations of the satellites alluded to ;-the overtures however for an object-glass of twelve inches diameter, and twenty feet focal length (Paris measure), with which I had proposed to construct an equatorial, similar to that of which an engraving is given in the former paper, were most unexpectedly arrested in limine, by Mr. FRAAUNHOFER declining to supply me with one, unless accompanied by apparatus provided by himself-a useless augmentation of expence, which prudence therefore'did not authorize me, to incur. t The like indulgence was granted me for the importation of my ordinary baggagG, travelling carriage, and for whatever I deemed necessary to render my sojourn in France comfortable. and positions of 458 double and triple stars, &c. 5 Douanes, Mons. le Marquis de VAULCHIER, and so extreme the politeness of the principal and subordinate officers of the Customs at Calais, that the importation and exportation of them, were affairs, not of difficulty, but of gratification. It is needless to state, that on the establishment of an observatory by a private individual in a foreign country, many difficulties must be encountered. To Mons. BENJAMIN DELESSERT, whose liberality in promoting every thing which has science for its aim knows no bounds, I stand indebted, amongst other things, for whatever comfort my observatory afforded. From the members of the Royal Academy of Sciences of Paris I uniformly received every possible attention, whilst to Messrs. DE LA PLACE, ARAGO, BOUVARD, HUMBOLDT, and POISSON, a residence of fifteen months has placed me under obligations of no common order: they were received with PRIDE, and are remembered with GRATITUDE. The Society have now before them, with few exceptions, a re-examination of all the identified double and triple stars described by Sir W. HERSCHEL in the Philosophical Transactions ; with the sentiments therefore of the illustrious author of the Mecanique Cedeste I will conclude-," Had the labours of Sir W. HERSCHEL been confined to this department of astronomy, the discoveries he has made in it would have alone conferred upon him an imperishable name.'. JAMES SOUTH.

The change of position is not material; but with respect to the increase of distance, it may be remarked once for all, that there is great reason to suspect a considerable instrumental error in all the measures of that early period, exceeding 40", the result being constantly (or most commonly) in defect, and that not unfrequently to a very large amount. The cause probably lies in the construction of the micrometer used ;* and its effect is to throw a great uncertainty on the earlier distances of all stars of the 6th and 6th classes.

The centre piece of this instrument is spheroidal: the length of the horizontal or transverse axis, including the pivots, is z8 inches: on one end of this axis is a circle of 9.9 inches diameter, having a ring of silver soldered to its circumference, on which the dividing lines are drawn; the circle is provided with a level and two verniers; the scale of the former reading to io seconds,,the latter to minutes only; it is intended solely as a finder, but will give the apparent altitude of a celestial object accurate to one minute.

Between this night and the zznd of October, when the observatory at Passy was broken up, unfavourableness of the weather prevented me getting a second series of observations.axis; the cones however of the horizontal axis being firmly soldered and pinned to a shoulder projecting from the centre-piece, are not separable from it: the level of the axis is supplied with a silver scale, each division of which is equivalent to one second. In the focus of the object-glass are seven equi-distant wires, the equatorial interval between any two of them being about zo seconds of time: on each side of the meridian wire, and at equal distances from it, are two others, so placed that the pole star shall pass from it to either of them in two minutes, for a purpose explained in the Memoirs of the Astronomical Society (vide Vol. I. page 238); applicable to each side plate, is an apparatus for regulating the quantity of light projected from the lamp upon the wires. The side plates are similar to those belonging to my Four-feet Transit Circle, and which (.[ believe) were described in REES'S Encyclopxdia, when the instrument was the property of Mr. GnOOMBRIDGE. A second level for the horizontal axis, a spare one for the altitude circle, and a second wireplate furnished with spiders' lines are at hand, and are ready for immediate use, should accident sustained by any of the first set, render them unfit for service-a reserve which no traveller should neglect; lest also any of the screws by which the various parts of the instrument are connected should be lost, a few additional ones placed in the box are not, (as I have found by experience), without their use. The object-glass was made by Mr. TULLEY, and originally belonged to the Westbury Circle: its clear aperture is 2.7 inches, its focal length is 43 inches; with a magnifying power of 300 it defines oa Lyrie, Arcturus and Aldebaran, perfectly sharp and round; separates very distinctly the close stars of 7 Leonis, ? Bootis, and Orionis; whilst with i So (the commonly used power) under favourable circumstances, the small star south preceding Polaris, is sufficiently visible to enable the observer to take its transit, with considerable precision. The instrument is mounted on stone piers, and has retained its meridian position extremely well; fifteen months' experience has shown, thatwhilst the maximum error, to which the mean of a single series of observations of any star south of the zenith of my observatory, does not exceed 4-tenths of a second, often, very often, the result of a single set will not deviate z-tenths from the true right ascension. When the pole star is steady, its transit over the wire may be determined to one second. Thus much for its utility. As for its portability: the transverse axis, the telescope tubes, and the altitude circle, are included in a box 29 inches long, 14 inches broad, and 61 inches deep. The three levels, the spare wire-plate, the light regulating apparatus, the lamp, &c. are lodged in a case 271 inches in length, i I I in breadth, and 31 in depth. The side plates, with their appendages of nuts, screws, &c. are contained in a box 13I4 inches long, 7 inches broad, and 71 inches deep; arid the tout ensemble is well accomu modated under the seat of my travelling carriage.

Under these circumstances, the veneered deal of which the English hat-box is constructed, afforded a material not liable to this inconvenience-its pliability rendered it easy to add one cylinder to another, so as to form a tube of any desired length, its weight at the same time very slightly disturbing the equilibrium of the telescope. 54 Mr. SOUTH'S observations of the apparent distances No. CCCCXLVII.

The night, which had been remarkably fine, cloudless, and unusually favourable for delicate observations, on account of the extreme steadiness of the stars, which enabled me to keep them bisected by the wires as long as I pleased, suddenly became bad; a dense fog in less than five minutes after the instrument was placed upon this star, rendered all the stars, Jupiter and Saturn, invisible; the Moon's place also was scarcely to be distinguished. It has frozen all day: the thermometer in the shade stood between z90 and 310: it now indicates 280. The instrument is covered with hoar frost, and the fog is so severe that I cannot see across the garden, a distance from the observatory not more than ioo feet.

The past has been a night such as rarely, very rarely occurs; from five o'clock in the afternoon till now, (four o'clock in the morning,) the stars have been unusually tranquil, and most exquisitely defined. At the commencement of the observations the Thermometer in the observatory stood at 3 iO, and it has gradually fallen to 230. Trhe deposition of moisture on the interior surface of the object-glass, and its I 58 Mr. SOUTH'S observations of 'the apparent distances No. D CV. continued. crystallisation on the exterior surface, have been so considerable, although arn attached deal tube projects twelve inches beyond it, that I have been obliged to remove it very frequently; but no trouble is too great to obtain measures, under circumstances so peculiarly favourable. Twenty stars have been observed, amongst them several of the most difficult, and some which I have never before seen double. Now however the dew is not confined to the parts of the telescope in the neighbourhood of the object-glass, but has attacked the wires of the micrometer; they have a serrated appearance; and I suspect begin to c fiddle." Prudence advises me to relinquish observing, lest by persevering they should become broken. Many nights since my abode here, the dew has been far more copious, than I ever observed it to be 'in England; frequently the water has dripped off the instrument for several successive hours, but I never had any reason to suspect the slightest precipitation of moisture on the micrometer wires. The polar axis and object-end of the telescope, which in the earlier parts of the night were covered with hoar frost, are now coated with ice. Mean Result.

This is a case, where from the 206 Mr. SOUTH'S observations of the apparent distances No. D CLXXXI. continued. great inequality and closeness of the two stars, single measures cannot be regarded as of any weight; hence no certain conclusion can be drawn respecting its motion or rest. The distance however seems to have increased materially, as ,5 .391 is much too great for a star of the first class; and in 1783 the interval between the discs was stated at from 1 to 13 diameter, according to the power used.

In 1783 it is described as having the interval of the discs only 1d diameter of the large star, which, for a star of the 8th magnitude, could hardly correspond to more than 4" from centre to centre. The angles it is true, agree-that given by Sir W. HERSCHEL in 1783 being 600 48' np, differing only 2' from its present value. This star requires further observation.

The position of 1781 is 870 14' sp, differing 80 5,3' from the present; an extraordinary change for a star of the 6th class, and one so easy of measurement. In PIAZZI'S catalogue, a proper motion of -o".o3 in R. A. and + 4-d'. 8 in declination is ascribed to the large star. This should carry the large star almost directly away from the small one (and indeed there is an apparent increase of 6" in the distance, could the earlier measure be relied on) ; but no sensible change of angle could thus arise.

Epoch 1825.26. This star appears to have sustained a very extraordinary change both in distance and position. Sir W. HERSCHEL'S measures are as follows:-I-781.80 (Oct. 22)Pos. 11039' nf, Dist. i9"'.53. Thus in 43.46 years no less an arc than 36' 24' has been described, being at the rate of -o0.838 per annum, and a change of distance to the amount of + 6". 707, or + d'.1,4 per annum. An observation in a 2o-feet sweep in 1785 confirms the fact of the angle made by the two stars being then small. " Equulei, double, very unequal, a few degrees nf. S. r. and positzons of 458 double and triple stars, &C. 279 No. DCCLXXXII. continued. The star is a remarkable one; and from its magnitude and situation in the heavens, not to be confounded with any other. The proper motions assigned to this star in PIAZZI'S Catalogue, account satisfactorily for the change observed. They are respectively + o".o8 in R. A. and o'.29 in declination. These motions, in 44 years, would carry the large star 3".5 to the following, and 12".8 to the south side of its place in 1781, or, in a direction, making an angle of 740 sf with the parallel. Supposing then the small star fixed,' the present angle of position and distance should be 470 nf and 22".5 instead of 480 3' and 26".24 which observation makes them, If we consider the uncertainty which necessarily hangs about the earlier distance, depending as it does on a single mean sure, and from the extreme minuteness of the small star, liable easily to an error of 2 or 3", it will be allowed that a more satisfactory verification of the proper motion of the one star, and the comparative fixity of the other, could hardly have been looked for. This, among other similar instances will serve to show the advantage which may be taken of the measures of double stars in' all researches relating to the proper motions of the stars. This star appears to be a fit object for the investigation of parallax. (.) No. DCCLXXXIII. R. A. 21h t7` ; Decl. 8? 2' S. STRUVE, 716; Hist. CX1. 197. Double; 9th and 92 magnitudes.

These compared with the present, present a great disagreement. If we take the mean of the two earlier observations we get 350 to' np, and 1793.1 for a mean epoch, which compared with the measures of 18g2 give an arc of 60421, described in an interval of 33 years, or about + 0o0203 per annum. The data, it is true, are precarious, but the conclusion is such as to render it worth while to watch this star in future. (H.) * This star was found by sweeping in the neighbourhood of the 784th star of STRUVE'S Catalogue. The star however whose place is there given, was only seen as a single star: it is therefore very probable that the one here measured is Sir W.

It is possible therefore that it may be somewhat erroneous, though proba-. bly not to the whole extent (1 l46') which this discordance would require; yet a trifling error in the present measure or in the angular velocity would reconcile all.

The distances ascribed to A B disagree, it is true, more than a second, a very considerable quantity on so small a distance, it must be confessed. It is probable that the real distance is a mean between them, or 7".42. Si8 Mr. SOUTH'S re-examination of the apparent distances No. V. R.

There is a considerable change in the position of the close star since the year 1823. At that time ( 1823.28 ) the angle was 680 39' sf (See Phil. Trans. 1824. Part III.) Hence it appears that the small star has continued its motion in the direction there assigned to it; and, if we may confide sufficiently in both data, with an accelerated velocity, for the computed motion corresponding to an interval of 2.0: years would be 10.148, whereas the observations make it t 18' or .3. Meanwhile the direction of the motion is as predicted, and we may therefore regard the reality of this star's rotation as fully confirmed.

Note; In taking the mean, the ten observations of February i8 are considered equivalent to the seven of which the other sets are composed. These measures, compared with those recorded in the Phie. losophical Transactions for 1824, afford, in the short interval of 2a.g12, a very satisfactory verification of the quantity as well as of the direction of the motion there assigned. The angle at that epoch (1823.11) was 5 i'sp. It is now 60 421 sp. The motion then is _10 41' or retrograde, as it ought to be. Now if we compute the motion on the supposition of the actual angular velocity being (as there assigned) -o?.777, we shall find 10 38', differing insensibly from the observed quantity. That this degree of exactness is not quite accidental, other similar instances to be adduced will convince us. (H.) No. VII. R. A. 7h 68m; Decl. 28? 0' N. i1 Cancri; I. ii ; H. andcS. 88.

Our former measures were Position 68? 17' sf ;Distance 6".241; Epoch 1822.14.

The observations of A C, when the star A was only seen as a single star, are rejected. This star presents the hitherto unique combination of three individuals, forming, if not a system connected by-the agency of attractive forces, at least one in which all the parts are in a state of relative motion. To begin with the two nearer stars A and;B. Sir W. HERSCHEL'S measure of their position Nov. 28, 1781 (1781.90) was 860 32' nf and it will be remarked, that a position so nearly perpendicular to the diurnal motion carries in some measure its own verification with it, as not liable to gross error. This4 differs no less than 540 23' from the present angle in the same quadrant giving a mean annual motion of + I'.2 54 or direct (uf sp). The distance remains as it was, so close as to be barely separable. In 1802 it was so also; but at that time, though observed by andpositions of s6 double and triple stars, &C.327 No. VIII. R.

The evidence for the motion of the more distant star C will be found in the Philosophical Transactions 1824, Part III. p. l 15-. The change of quadrant-the great amount of the motion (230 42' in 404 years) and the circumstance of an error to that amount, or anything like it, being perfectly impossible from the considerable distance of the stars; add, too, the regular gradations by which the change appears, from several intervening observations, to have taken place; all these considerations place the motion of the distant star beyond dispute, and the present measures confirm it, the angle 670 55' Sf compared with that of 1822 (680 17' sf) indicating a motion still in the same direction. Its amount, it is true, is only _ 22' instead of 10 '4' which the assigned velocity would give, but this is as near a coincidence as we have a right to expect in such small quantities. If this be really a TERNARY system connected by the mutual attraction of its parts, its perturbations 'will present one of the most intricate problems in physical astronomy. The difficulty will not be diminished by the circumstance of the rotations of the two small stars about the large one being (apparently at least) performed in opposite directions, being the reverse of what obtains in our planetary system, or by that of the deviations of the relative angular velocities from KEPLER'S law, being such as to indicate either great masses in all the three bodies, great excentricities in their orbits, or a different law of gravity from what obtains in our system.

In taking the mean the distances of March 20 are rejected ; if not rejected, the mean of the 25 observations will give distance 2".273. Nothing can be more satisfactory than the confirmation these observations afford of the rapid motion ascribed to this remarkable star. In the interval of 1.97 year since the Epoch 182s.29 the motion has amounted to no less than 130 ay't in the direction n p sf, or 7.0925 per annum. The sudden diminution of velocity is however not confirmed. Indeed it rested on too short an interval, and on too few ob-, servations (for such very close stars) to deserve great confidence. We cannot do better than recommend this star for the next io or 20 years to the constant and careful measurement of astronomers; nor can we too strongly inculcate here the indispensable necessity of multiplying extremely their measures of position, to eliminate those errors of judgment to which the most experienced observers are liable in measures of this sort. This done, there is no doubt of our arriving at a precise knowledge of the elements and position of the orbit described by each about their common centre of gravity; and the question of the extension or non-extension of the NEWTONIAN law of gravity to the sidereal heavensthe next great step which physical astronomy has yet to make-will be effectually decided.

The discordance however is unfortunately such as to prevent any certain conclusion as to the motion or rest of the stars from being drawn.

Taking the means of the above angles and epochs, allowing each a weight proportional to the number of measures on which it rests, we get for the mean Epoch 1825.34 the angle of position 540 26' np. This, compared with the measures of 1822, gives + 10 27' for the observed motion in the interval of 2.79 years. The motion computed on a supposition of + oQ.4378 per annum assigned in a former paper, should be + 1z 14', differing insensibly from that actually found by observation. The motion of this star is therefore very satisfactorily confirmed both in direction and quantity ; and when we reflect on the extreme difficulty of it (in respect of position), this will serve to give great confidence in results which depend on a great number of measures, however wide of the mark individual measures may be.

III.) it is remarked that the continuance or decrease of the then angular velocity of about 10 per annum for a few years, would decide the question of rectilinear or orbitual motion. The present observations, then, go a great way towards deciding this interesting question, as, so far from indicating any retardation, their tendency lies the other way. In fact, (supposing them free from error), no less than -AS' 5' have been described in 974 years, being at the rate of 10.420 per -annum. This star therefore merits peculiar attention, as the great variation of its distance gives reason to suppose a great ellipticity, or considerable inclination of its orbit.

HERSCHEL however having described it as triple, I have examined it several times with reference to this point; but the extreme unsteadiness of the stars, particularly those of low altitudes, during several weeks past, has precluded the use of high magnifying powers. This evening the stars being more tranquil, a power of 327 was applied, and an elongation of the large star was at times suspected: 413 confirmed the suspicion, but was inadequate to separate the two stars. The angles here given were obtained with 513, with which the discs of the stars seemed in contact; but their extreme unsteadiness under this magnifying power rendered all attempts to procure measures of distance abortive ; and the position, from this circumstance, must be regarded with some distrust. The stars have the same colour, and were observed on the meridian. Passy; June 21, 1825 ; Seven-feet Equatorial. Each of the 7th magnitude. Position = 810 48' np or sf 1 5 Obs. I Diff. = 60 z2'.

The change in this star since the last observations is such as to confirm the direction of its motion ; but the quantity is more than calculation would give, amounting to no less than 60 13', instead of 1' 6'. This renders it probable that the measures of 1823 are erroneous,* and that Mr. STRUVE'S measure in 1820 (+60 33' np) is entitled to greater confidence. The former rest on the observations of one night; and long experience has now shown, that this can never be fully depended on. (H.) No. XXI. R. A. 16h 8m ; Decl. 340 20'N. aCoroneI. 3; H. and S. 222.

The great and almost sudden increase of angular velocity from 20 to nearly 70 per annum, is not verified; and the angle 4Q0 o' nf for 1819, on which it rests, must of necessity have been considerably in error. Now this is the very angle which, according to the table (p. 252, Phil. Trans. 1824.

By this mode of observing we have two chances of detecting proper motion, each of which will afford a verofcation of the other; for suppose the star A of 36 Ophiuchi to have a motion toward the south, say at the rate of one second per annum, then will the difference of declination between it and the star C to the north of it, be increased annually by one second; but that which increased the difference of declination between these two stars, should diminish the difference of declination between A of 36, and A of 38 Ophiuchi; and if our observations be correct, the increase of difference on the one hand, should be exactly equal to the decrease of it, on the other; and vice versa, should the proper motion of A of 36, carry it toward the north. Secondly, in Right Ascension. Suppose the proper motion of A of 36 to be toward the west annually one second, the result will be, to lessen the difference of right ascension of it, and of the preceding star C, and at the same time to augment the difference of right ascension between A of 36, and A of 38; and, as before, the decrease in the one instance, should be equalled by the increase in the other ; and if the proper motion of A of 36, take an easterly direction, it will be detected by consequences opposite to those just described, but offering similar verifications. and positions of 96 double and triple stars, &c. 361 No. XXIV.

In the case of 61 Cygni, by following a similar mode of observing, (but using six stars of comparison instead of two,) I satisfied myself in a very few months, of the enormous proper motion of that extraordinary double star. To those who may feel disposed thus to attack proper motion, I would hint, how indispensable it is, that their Equatorial should be well clamped, and that they should wait during the observations of difference of declination, till the earth's diurnal motion bring each of the following stars, opposite that part of the wire where the bisection of the first star was made; the results will then be charged with no instrumental error, which it is in their power to avoid: the observations also should be conducted as nearly on the meridtan as possible. When the above was written, I was not aware that the star 38 Ophiuchi had been observed since the time of FLAMSTEED; on examining however PIAZZI'S catalogue, I find that it stands there under the name of 31 Scorpii, and that its place has been determined by 19 observations of that emiinent astronomer; perhaps therefore some light may at the present time, be thrown upon the subject under consideration; but some corrections will be needed by our observations, to render them comparable with those, to which we are alluding. The star s6 Ophiuclhi is composed of two stars of nearly equal magnitudes, and distant from each other 5".200; whe-. ther BRADLEY'S instruments showed it double, does not appear; nor from PJAzzI's catalogue, does it seem that he saw it otherwise than as a single star; hence it is fair to MDCCCXXVI. 3 a 362 Mr. SOUTH'S re-examination of the apparent distances No. XXIV. R. A. 17h 4m; Decl. 260 18' S 36 Ophiuchi; H. and S. 243. continued. suppose, that the star was by one and the other observed as single; our observations therefore must be corrected by half the difference of declination, and by half the difference of right ascension, which with the preceding distance, and position 410 32' will be 1".724 in declination, and 1".946 on the parallel, equal to o".l17 of right ascension in time. For the star 38 Ophiuchi no correction of this sort will be required: its smaller star was certainly neither seen by BRADLEY nor by PIAZZI ; and its magnitude, even were it at the time closer than it now is, would not sensibly alter the apparent centre of the disc of A of 38. But the differences of declination observed by us are uncorrected for refraction: the necessary equations being applied, we get, Diff. of decl. of A of 36 Ophiuchi & of 3oScorpii 3' 2".403 . . . . * . . . . . & A of 38 Ophiuchi 5' 25".764; and when the corrections to reduce these results to observations of the centre of the two stars of 36 Ophiuchi are applied, the quantities become S' 4"/.127 and 5' 24".04o for the differences of declination; and for differences of right ascension (in time) 5o2".,591 and 2' 1 1".905 respectively. Now by BESSEL'S proper motion,* the difference of declination of 36 Ophiuchi and of 3o Scorpii, Epoch i 825.57, should be 3' 4".930, differing with our determination only 8-tenths of a second: hence in declination, the two stars have either the same, or no proper motion. But BESSEL does not give the proper motion in right ascension, for it appears that BRADLEYf did not observe the * Vide Fundam. Astronom. page 31 1I t In BRADLEY'S published observations I have not met with any observed R.

A. (in time) 52'.50, agreeing with our determination to 9-hundredths of a second; hence also in R. A. as well as in declination, they have, if any, the same proper motion. If however the proper motions attributed to them be correct, and if none be enjoyed by A of 38 Ophiuchi, the difference of declination between s6 and 38 should be 5' 23".073, .~~ ~ ~~~~ ~ ~ 2. . .7 . differing not one second from our determination: and if the proper motion in right ascension attributed to 36 be correct (the star s8 being fixed), the difference of R. A. (in time) between them should be 2' I 1".76 only fourteen hundredths of a second, at variance with our observations; quantities which may be very fairly attributed to errors of observation, Hence it follows, that the two stars 36 Ophiuchi and so Scorpii, although distant from each other more than 12 minutes, are journeying together through space; and that the annual proper motions (I".o7h6 and i". i5 toward the south, and o".59 and o".58 toward the west), assigned to them, are true. From the above investigation we also learn, that the star 38 Ophiuchi has no sensible proper motion; consequently the -observed increase of distance between it andthe small star,* if it exist, must probably be sought for, in some peculiarity of the latter. mass of his observations, (copied from the original possessed by the University of Oxford,) by GAEL MORRIS, and now in the library of the Royal Society: that any observation of this illustrious Astronomer, (' le Modele des Observateurs" of La PLACE, and whose observations, (in the emphatic language of the same Philosopher) constitute " l'6poque d'oui lon doit partir maintenant, dans les recherches delicates de la science," should be recorded only in perishing manuscript, is to be hoped in these enlightened times, will not remain long an object of regret to Astronomers. * Referred to in page 209. 364 Mr. SOUTH'S re-examination of the apparent distances No. XXV.

If now we collect all the observations made in the years 182, 1822, 1823, and 1825, we find as follows: 1821.51; 660?5o' sf (Mean of HERSCHEL'S, SOUTH's, and STRUVE'S Obs. Phil. Trans. 1824. iii. p. 290. 1822.49; 650 7'sf H. and S.1822. 1823.32; 63 25 sf; H. and S. 1823. 825.54; 58 s sf; S. ut supra. The intervals are o.98 o.83, and 2.22 years, and the Angles described respectively in them-10.717, ? and -5.367, whence the angular velocities come out respectively -10.751, -20.o5o, and 20,418, all of them greatly below what appears to have been the velocity up to 182,o and not differing more than might fairly be expected, considering the difficulty presented by the unequal size of the stars. The last determination, considering the great number of measures it rests upon, may be regarded as entitled to great confidence, in spite of the discordant results of April s and May 3, 1825, which, however, whether rejected or retained, make little difference in the final mean. It was on these (unluckily), that the note at the end of the paper of 1824 was founded. The fact of a great diminution of angular velocity then iin and positions of 56 double and triple stars, &c. 369 No. XXVI. R. A. :17h 56m ; Decl. 2? 3' N. 70 p Ophiuchi; I1. 4; H. and S. 258. continued. this star can hardly be doubted. But as it is inconsistent with the laws 'of central forces that this should take place without a corresponding increase of distance (for the angular velocity is inversely as the square of the distance in the apparent as well as in the real orbit, whatever be its position with regard to the line of sight), it becomes necessary to examine more minutely into the distances at the different epochs. It will be observed, however, that in all the interval from 178i to 181g we find no measure of the distance, and that the maximum of angular velocity must have taken place somewhere in this interval. (See Phil. Trans. 1824. iii. p. s90-29 1.) In such a case we must recur to estimations in diameters, though necessarily less to be depended on than positive measures. On reexamining Sir W. HIERSCHEL'S MSS., we fortunately find the following observations, which throw considerable light on this point and in some measure supply the deficiency of measures. It will be recollected that his measures of distance are always supposed to include both diameters of the stars measured. "October 27, 1779 3"'.593. They are very difficult to "measure, and for that reason Ijoin also an exact estimation by the eye. The vacancy between them "is 2L diameters of the largest-.certainly more than 2 "two and less than s. The smallest may be about 3 or 31 of the diameter of the other. They are exactly "in the equatorial motion; the largest goes first. The situation I took by letting them run along the hair."

From all these observations, it is clear that the interval between the stars about the year i780 -could not be less than 2 diameters, and by a mean of all the estimations, must have been about this quantity, or rather more than less. The small star being taken at 0.6 of the diameter of the large, the distance of their centres must -have been 2.8 D, and the distance, including the diameters, 3.6 D. Now as this distance by the mean of all the measures, was 4" .492, we have D= 1".25 and 2.8 Di= s".5oo. Again; we find the following observation, the only one which occurs in the interval in question. "' June 3, 1804. About LT diameter of L."

Our former observations gave 370 8' sf for the position of this double star, Epoch 183s.1 3; offering a difference of more than 51 degrees with the present determination; but the observations are attended with so much difficulty, that no positive conclusion can be formed relative to the rest or motion of this star: the first memoir contained no observations of distance. whilst theformerfpart of the communicatzion was in the press. 391 No. VI.

I Diff. _4 4z'. Excessively difficult. The small star only visible by glimpses; observations made on the meridian, with 787; the extreme unsteadiness of the stars renders it impossible to procure any measures of distance, and those of position must be received with caution. The unfavourableness of the weather has not allowed ine to procure other measures of this difficult star. Sloane-street, March 18, 1826. The position April 4, 1783, was measured with a 2o-feet reflector, 12 inches aperture, and found to be 20? 54' sf. The change is very great, no less than 430 2o' in 42.8 years, or almost precisely a degree per annum. There can be little doubt, therefore, that this very curious double star is entitled to a place among the revolving stars or Binary systems. The uncertainty of thfe present observations, arising from the difficulty of the star, and the unfavourable weather, might render us cautious in admitting this conclusion; but a series of well-agreeing measures by Mr. STRUVE, On four nights, from Feb. 25, to April 4, 1825, which give a mean result 630,7 sf sufficiently establish the fact. These interesting observations are contained in a letter from Mr. STRUVE, dated April 21, 1825. (H.) JAMES SOUTH. 132 Sloane-street, April 7th, 1826.
