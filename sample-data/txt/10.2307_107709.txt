VII. A finite and exact expression for the Refraction of an Atmosphere nearly resembling that of the Earth. By THOMAS YOUNG, M. D. For. Sec. R. S. Read February A, 1824. IT has lately been demonstrated, in the Journal of the Royal ,Institution that if the pressure of the atmosphere ,y be represented either by the square or by the cube of the square root of the density ,z, the astronomical refraction ,r, may be obtained in a finite equation. Mr. IVoRY, in a very ingenious and elaborate paper lately presented to the Royal Society, has computed the refraction by means of several refined transformations, and with the assistance of converging series, from an equation which expresses the pressure in terms of the density and of its square: A have now to observe, that if we substitute, for the simple density, the cube of its square -root, and make y =2 .z1, we shall represent the constitution of the most important part of the atmosphere with equal accuracy, although this expression supposes the total height somewhat smaller than the truth, and belongs toone -of those hypotheses, which Mr. IVORY has considered as inadmissible: it has the advantage, however, of affording a irect equation for the refraction, which agrees very nearly with Mr. IvoRy'S table, and still more accuraTy with the French table, and with that which has been published for some years in the Nautical Almanac. Since d x _ I m being the number of times that the mz modulus of the atmospherical elasticity is contained in the 16o Dr. YOUNG on afinite and exact expression for the refraction radius of the earth, and here dy = v/z d z _z d z, we have dx=__ z + dz ,andfdx-x 9V /Z +L+ 7 , for the height above the earth's surface, which, when z o becomes .x 273oo = 95550 feet. For the refraction, we have the equation d r2pdz (Astr. Coil. XV.) -pdz -y (zfd x + v2~ + z p z)' which is the value originally assigned to this fluxion by Dr. BROOK TAYLOR; V being the sine of the apparent altitude and here dr= ~ ~~_pdz >S,~~~~~~~~ + 02 or, if z=4', and dz= 2-Adi, dr _d__ _ _ __ / V (& p 2 p + [-m+ zrj+2 which is equivalent to the o d of the Article %I(a +bx cxX) FLUENTS in the Encyclopwdia Britannica, No. 259 ; -the fluent being 4V'(a+bx+cx) --v hl (2cx+b+s2Vcov'aa+ bx+cx1J)] and its whole value from z 1 to z = o, being -c ;Zr o/ (a + 7!V) &v+'---)h I putting a' 2 %IC b +' 2 4/ c(a + v W) 2/p, since a + b + c -=V2. For the numerical values of the coefficients, taking, at the temperature of 5o0,p = . ooo2835, and = .001294m 772.8, a =P 7JrVI 008491 + ve, b = 9= .011646, m m and c-m + 2 p-* oo315 ; hence P= .7972, Vd = g 0921466, V/ c. 05617, i-.o367, 2 c + b -.oo5336, and r.1 7972 (V/(. 008491+V') v-. 10367hl 01 646-.11234 VG of an atmosphere nearly resembling that of the earth. 161 and at the horizon, when v 0, r=. 17972 (. 0921466-. 10367 h I 005336 009840 = 33'42',5; which is only 11",5 less than the quantity assigned by the French tables and; in the Nautical Almanac, while Mr. IvoRY makes it 34' 17?",5. Again, if we take v = . I, for the altitude 5o 44'291 ', we obtain 8'49",5 for the refraction, while the Nautical Almanac gives us 8'53", and Mr. IVORY'S table 8' 49",6. There is however no reason for proceeding to compute a new itable by this formula, the method employed for-the table in the Nautical Almanac being rather more compendious in all common cases: and even if it were desired to represent Mr. IVORY'S table by -the approximation there employed, we might obtain the same results, with an error never much exceeding a single second, from the equation ooo28sss z020r2s~oS (& I+I*' 0002SSS asr + Add v r2, * 4? s (s r+J 3 1r Welbeck Street, 3rd.
