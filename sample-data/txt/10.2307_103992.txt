(171) VII. An Account of the Births and Burials with the Number of the Inhabitants at Stoke-Damerell in the County of Devon. Communicated by the Reverend Mr. Barrow. SEveral Accounts of Births and Burials having been published for the Satisfaction of the Curious; the following, which in one Respect (the Number of Inhabitants) is more particular than most I have seen, will, I hope, be acceptable to the Publick. A Survey being taken about Michaelmas 1733, of the Inhabitants of Stoke-Damerell in the County of Devon, the Number of Persons, Men, Women, and Children, residing in the Parish, amounted to 3361. By the Register, I find that in the same Year, 28 Couple were married, 61 Males and 61 Females baptized, and 62 People buried. Bapized. Buried. Number of People. 122. 62. 3361. Whence it appears that the Number of Persons who died, is one more than half the Number of Children born; and that about 1 in 54 died. It is to be observed, that the General Fever, which almost all the Inhabitants of the same Place were ill of at the same time, was in part within the Year mentioned: also that one of the Persons included in the Number of those buried, was a Foreigner brought from on board a Dutch Ship in the River; and that 2 more were drowned from on board a Man of War; but the Ships Companies are not included in the Number of the Inhabitants. Not from this Account only, but from Experience and Observations, both of my self and better Judges, I (172) I reckon the Parish of Stoke-Damerell as healthful an Air as any in England.
