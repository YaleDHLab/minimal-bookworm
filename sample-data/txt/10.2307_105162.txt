[318] XLVIII. A Letter of Mr. William Shervington to Benjamin Franklin, Esq; of Philadelphia, concerning the Transit of Mercury over the Sun, on the 6 of May 1753, as observed in the Island of Antigua: Communicated by Mr. Peter Collinson, F. R. S. S I R, Antigua, June 20, 1753. MR. Benjamin Mecom having received half a dozen circulatory letters from you relating to Mercury's transit over the sun the 6 of last May, he put them into my hands. One would have sufficed for our island, as we are not overburthen'd with men, who have a taste that way. Hereunder I send you the result of my observation * thereof. Sunday, May 6, at 6h 7~ 51~, I observed the western limb of Mercury to touch the western limb of the sun; and, at 6h 10~ 37~, he touch'd the same with his eastern limb, and totally disappear'd. Lat. of the place 17~ ~ N. Lon. by estimation 61~ 45~ W. from London. This was taken by a Graham's watch, and corrected by two altitudes taken by a most exquisite quadrant; viz. At * Dr. Charles Rose, who was in Antigua at this time, says, that these observations were taken by Capt. Richard Tyrrel, of the said island, I [319] At 6h 58~ 7~, I observed the distance of the sun's upper limb from the zenith = 72~ 21~ 30~. And, at 9h 31~ 5~, I observed the same = 36~ 17~ 0~. By the common process (which you may have, if necessary) I found the watch was 0~ 4~ 4~ 28~ too fast *; therefore, h ~ ~ ~ From 6 10 37 Take 0 4 4 28 True appart. time of Mercs. exit here, 6 6 32 32 Pray impart your observation to Your Well-wisher, William Shervington. island, and who is possessed of a valuable collection of astronomical instruments, made by Mr. Bird in the Strand, London, and that Mr. Shervington only was present. * Mr. Shervington has taken the mean of these two altitudes from the error of his watch; and there can be no doubt that his observation is a good one, which, compared with that made in Surry-street by Mr. Short, p. 199, l. ~. &c. fixes the longitude of the place of his observation in Antigua 4h 5~ 30~, or 61~ 22~ 30~, west of St. Paul's, London.
