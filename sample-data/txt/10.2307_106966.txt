PHILOSOPH ICAL T R A N S A CT IONS, OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY d-/ or LONDON. FOR THE YEAR MDCCXCVII. PART L. LONDON, SOIL) BY PETER ELMSSLY, PRINTER TO THE ROYAL SOCIETY. MDCCXCVIII . ADVERTISEMENT. THE Committee appointed by the RoAld Sociey to direct the pub. lication of the Philosofihical Transactions', take this opportunity to acquaint the Public, that it fully appears, as:well from the council books and journals of the Society, as from repeated declarations which have been made'in several fortner Transactions, that the printing of themwars always, from time to time, the single act of the respective Secretaries, till the Forty-seventh Volume: the Society, as a Body, never interesti themselves any further in their publication than by occasionally recommendingthe re val of them to some of their SeZ cretaries, when, from the particular circumstances of their affairs, the l ransactinrls had happened for any length of time to be. intermitted. And this serems principally to have been, done with a view to satisfy the Public, that their usual meetings were then continued, for the improvement of knowledge, and benefit of mankind, the great ends of their first institution by the Royal Charters, and which they have ever since steadily pursued. But the Society being of late years greatly enlarged, and their communications more numerous, it was thought advisable, that a Cominittee of their members should be appointed to reconsider the papers read before them, and select out of them such as they should judge most proper for publication in the future Transactions; which was accordingly done upon the 26th of March, i7C52. And the grounds A a of their choice are, and will continue to be, the importance and singularity of the subjects, or the advantageous manner of treating them; without pretending to answer for the certainty of the facts, or pro. priety of the reasonings, contained in the several papers so published, which must still rest on the credit or judgment of their respective authors. It is likewise necessary on this occasion to remark, that it is an established rule of the Society, to which they will always adhere, never to give their opinion, as a Body, upon any subject, either of Nature or Art, that comes before them. And therefore the thanks, which are frequently proposed from the Chair to be given, to the authors of such papers as are read at their accustomed meetings, or to the persons through whose hands they receive them, are to be considered in' no other light than as a matter of civility, in return for the 'respect shewn to the So-ciety by those communications. The like also is to be said with re-. gard to -the severalprojects, inventions and curiosities of various kinds, which are often exhibited to: the Society; the authors whereof, or those who exhibit them, frequently take the liberty to report, and even to certify in the public news-papers, that they have met with the highest applause and approbation. And therefore it is hoped, that no regard will hereafter be paid to such reports, and public notices which In some instances have been too lightly credited, to the dishonour of the Society, CONTENTS.
