[ 81 ] V. On the Befiexion of Polarized Light fromn Polished Surfaces, Transparent and Metallic. By the Rev. SAMUEL HAUGHTON, A.A., F.-.S., Fellow of Trinity College, -Dublin. Received June 9,-Read June 19, 1862. Introduction. AMONG the experimenters who have made the reflexion of polarized light the object of their researches, there is no one to whom science is more indebted than to M. JAMIN, whose accurate observations are a model for subsequent observers. His first paper on this subject was published (1847) in the 19th volume of the ' Annales de Chimie et de Physique,' 3rd series, p. 296, on Metallic Reflexion. In this remarkable paper M. JAMIN verified many of the previous observations of BREWSTER, and added many of his own. He employed two distinct methods in these experiments,1st. The method of Comparative Intensities-by observing the relative intensities of the same beam of light reflected from a polished surface, composed partly of glass and partly of the substance to be examined. 2nd. The method of Multiple Reflexions, previously known from the researches of BREWSTER. The optical constants used by JAMIN in this paper are(a) The angle (i) of maximum polarization. (b) The angle (A) whose tangent is the ratio of I to J, the square roots of the intensities reflected in the plane of incidence, and in the perpendicular plane. (c) The coefficient (s) used by CAUCHY, which is connected with the other two constants by means of theoretical equations. By the first method of observation, M. JAMIN determines the constants i, and s for the following substances:1. Steel, 2. Speculum metal; and by the second method of observation, he determines i1 and A for 3. Silver, and It for 4. Zinc, and gives the details of experiments on 5. Copper, from which the optical constants may be found. MDCCCLxIH. N 82 REV. S. HJAUJGTONON THE REFLEXION M. JAMIN'S next paper on Metallic Reflexion appeared in 1848, in the Annales de Chim. et de Phys. 3rd series, vol. xxii. p. 311. In this paper he makes use of the second method of observation by multiple reflexion, and gives valuable tables of the results of his experiments with the various colours of the spectrum on the seven following metallic substances: 1. Steel. 2. Speculum metal. 3. Silver. 4. Zinc. 5. Copper. 6. Brass. 7. Bell metal. From these Tables the constants il and A may be inferred. In 1850 M. JAMIN published his well known paper " On the Reflexion of Light at the Surface of Transparent Bodies," in the Ann. de Chim. et de Phys. 3rd series, vol. xxix. p. 263. In this series of experiments he used a new method of observation, founded on the Quartz Compensator of BABINET. In this elaborate and important paper he publishes the details of his experiments on the following substances: 1. Fire Opal, 2. Hyalite, 3. Realgar, 4. Blende, 5. Diamond, 6. Fluor-spar, 7, 8. Two kinds of glass, and, in addition, gives in a Table at the end of the paper the constants of many other transparent bodies. M. JAMIN has also published, in 1851, in the Ann. de Chim. et de Phys. vol. xxxi.' p. 165, a memoir " On the Reflexion of Light at the Surface of Liquids," in which he determines the optical constants of many liquids. It occurred to me that the method of observation employed by JAMIN for transparent bodies might be advantageously used in the case of metals; and I was thus led to commence the series of experiments the results of which are recorded in the following pages. In these experiments I have added many metallic substances to JAMIN'S list, and have re-examined the metals observed by him by a different method. In transparent bodies I have examined a few not experimented on by JAMIN, and investigated in detail the form of the reflected ellipse, under varying conditions of incidence and azimuth. In the course of my paper I have employed for the second optical constant one more OF POLARIZED LIGHT FROM POLISHED SURFACES. 83 readily determined than those usually employed, but which is readily deduced from -the constants A and k of JAMIN. At the close of the paper I shall give a Table containing a comparison of the constants found by JAMIN and myself for all the bodies which we have both examined. Some years ago, in making observations on polarized light, I found that by adjusting properly the azimuth of the incident polarized beam, and allowing it to fall at the angle of principal incidence, I could obtain a reflected beam of circularly polarized light. On repeating the experiment with different polished surfaces, I found that the coefficient of re/Iexion, or whatever property it is that gives a surface a metallic reflexion, might be conveniently expressed by the cotangent of the azimuth at which an incident beam of plane-polarized light should be placed so as to give, on reflexion at the principal incidence, a reflected beam of circularly polarized light. The following paper contains an account of my experiments on many substances, and a Table of their Coefficients of Reflexion and Refraction, determined with as much accuracy as I was able to attain with the instruments at my disposal. The apparatus used by me consisted of a large graduated circle (horizontal), provided with two moveable arms, each furnished Fwith graduated circles (vertical); and the large horizontal circle was capable of being hung vertically, so as to allow -of experiments being made on liquids as well as solids. The substance to be examined was placed on a stage provided with adjusting screws, so as to bring the surface exactly into the centre, or intersection of the axes of the polarizing and analysing arms. These arms were mounted with Nicol prisms, made for me by DUBOSCQ of Paris, and without sensible deviation. The light employed was generally sunlight, but I sometimes used a modexator lamp with colza oil. I employed the quartz compensator described by M. JAMIN*, for the purpose of converting the elliptically polarized reflected light into plane-polarized light, before allowing it to pass through the analyser. The instrument used by me in making my observations on the reflexion of polarized light, was made by Mr. GRUBB of Dublin for the late Professor MCCuLLAGaR, and was presented to me, shortly after MCCULLAGH's death, by his brother. It is substantially the same as that described by M. JAMIN in vol. xxix. Ann. de Chim. et de Phys. ser. 3. I procured from M. DUBOSCQ SOLEIL, of Paris, a compensator of JAMIN'S pattern, and had it adapted to my own apparatus. In making my observations I used the following precautions: 1. The zero of both polarizer and analyser was determined by direct observation with red sunlight, reflected at the angle of polarization of several glasses found to give a reflected beam capable of being completely cut off by the Nicol prism. 2. The Nicol prisms themselves were carefully tested and found to have no deviation. 3. Each of my.recorded observations is the mean of four or five; and when these differed -from each other by more than 20', I took the precaution of repeating them* Annales de Chimie et de Physique, se'r. 3. vol. xxix. p. 263 et sfq.N2 84 REV. S. HAUGHTON ON THE REFLEXION again, on another day, with my eye fresh and unfatigued, before I finally adopted my mean. 4. I frequently repeated the observations, with the incident light polarized at an equal angle, at the opposite side of the plane of incidence; and also reversing the polarizer and analyser, so as to read the opposite sides of their scales. The following definitions will explain the sense in which I use certain terms. The Azimuth of a beam of plane-polarized light is the angle which its plane of polarization makes with the plane of incidence. The Index of Refraction is the ratio which the sine of the angle of incidence bears to the sine of the angle of refraction. The Coefficient of Refraction is the tangent of the Principal Incidence. The Princitpal Incidence is that angle of incidence at which rays polarized in any azimuth have the major axis of the reflected elliptic light in the plane of incidence; or at which the components of the reflected beam, in and perpendicular to the plane of incidence, differ by 900 in phase. This angle is nearly the same as BREWSTER'S Angle of Polarization or Maximum Polarization. The Coefficient of Reflexion is the Cotangent of the Azimuth of an incident beam of plane-polarized light, which after reflexion at the principal incidence becomes circularly polarized. The Principal Components of the incident and reflected light are the components in and perpendicular to the plane of incidence. The following preliminary investigation will serve to show the principles on which I have tabulated the results of my experiments:Let the elliptically polarized reflected beam be represented, as in the annexed figure, inscribed in a rectangle, whose sides are parallel to 0 I and 0 P, the plane of incidence and perpendicular plane. _ Let 0 x be the diagonal of the circumscribed rectangle, and 0 y the axis of the ellipse; it is required, from the difference of phase of the light in the planes 0 I and 0 PI / and knowing the direction of the line Ox, to find the direction of O y and the ratio of the axes of the ellipse. The angle x 0 I = o' is the azimuth of the reflected beam, measured by the analyser, after it has lost its elliptic polarization in the compensator; and the difference of phase of 0 1 and 0 P is measured in the compensator itself, by the displacement necessary to reduce the elliptically-polarized to plane-polarized light. We may imagine, to aid our conception, but without hypothesis, that a material point traverses the ellipse, and that its coordinates are Z=A sin (kt+e), ;=B sin (Jt +e'), where et-e is the difference of phase between the beams 01 and 0 P, and A, B are the lines 01I and 0 P. OF POLARIZED LIGHT FROM POLISHED $URFACES. 85 Eliminating t, we find .2 co.s (-e) B= sin2(et-e).(1.) In this ellipse, the angle ? made by the axis with the plane of incidence is found from the well-known expression 2E tangle -D-T belonging to the ellipse D 2+2Exy+Fy2= const. Substituting for D, E, F their values from (1.), we find tan2,P=tan2a'cos(e'-e);.(2.) p denoting the angle y 0 I, and a,' the angle x 0 1. But if a and b denote the axes of the ellipse, it can be proved that h2 (D+F)+(D-F)sec2; -=(DD+F)-(D-F)sec2f; or substituting from (1.) and (2.), a,,/-cot (+ ') cot ( a-os') a V-tanQ +c&')tan(9-c') j' From equations (2.) and (3.), I calculate the position of the elliptic axes and their ratio. The angle a' is obtained by direct measurement with the analysing prismn; and e' e may be found, as follows, from the compensator. In the compensator made for me by M. DUBOSCQ, I find that 39-43 represents the zero, t. e. the position in which the compensator affects equally the light 'in and perpendicular to the plane of incidence; the number of graduations corresponding to a difference of half a wave (1800) I found to be Red lamplight (colza oil) . . . . 1543 Red sunlight . 15-37 White lamplight (colza oil) . . . 13-29 If, therefore, C denote the reading of the compensator in any experiment, the difference of phase of the two principal beams will be expressed for red sunlight, in degrees, by the expression (C-39 43) X -1 and by a corresponding formula for the other kinds of light. The angle thus measured by the compensator is not the difference of phase between the principal components of the reflected light until it is increased by 180?, because experiment' shows that in the act of reflexion there is this constant difference between 86 REV. S. HAUGHTON ON TUE REFLEXION the two components, in addition to the varying difference of phase, depending on incidence, azimuth, and nature of polished surface. We therefore use the formula 'e=180+ C-39 i. . . . . . . . (4.) where i denotes the interval corresponding to 1800 for the light used. In tabulating my experiments, I give the original measurements of the analyser and compensator, and use the equations (2.), (3.), and (4.) to calculate the other columns. I. MUNIcH GLASS (a). The first experiments I shall record were made with glass procured from Munich by the late Professor MOCULLAGH. I have four rhombs made of it, whose index of refraction I determined by the following experiments: TABLE I.-Munich Glass (a). Rhomb. Angle. Minimum deviation* Refractive index. of red light. No.1..

I also found the refractive indices of No. 2 for the extreme red and violet rays to be 1-6190 and 1-6555, which indicates a dispersive power in the glass of 0'0573.

The last column of this Table is thus found: Let the principal components of the incident polarized beam, in and perpendicular to the plane of incidence, be Cos a and sino (unity denoting the incident beam); and let I and J denote what a unit of light becomes after reflexion, in and perpendicular to the plane of incidence respectively; then the principal components of the reflected beam are I cos an and J sin az, and therefore I=tan a cot ; .(5.) and the angle tan-'(J) may be found from this equation without any difficulty. According to the theory of FRESNEL, J cos (idr) Jicos (i-r)' an expression which vanishes at the polarizing angle (i+r= 900), and therefore tan-' (J) ought at this angle of incidence to vanish also; but we find, not only in this experiment, but in those which follow, that it does not vanish, but only reaches a minimum, the tangent of which is sensibly equal to what I have called the Coefficient of Reflexion *. In fact, let X denote the angle whose cotangent is this coefficient. Then I cos X, J sin X are the principal components of the reflected light, which by definition is circularly polarized, and therefore I cos X J sin X, and cot -J The coefficients of Refraction and Reflexion, as determined by this experiment, are therefore Coefficient of Refraction tan 540 57'=1 4255. Coefficient of Reflexion =cot 840 31'=0-0960. * Strictly speaking the angle of incidence at which the maximum is reached is found to be somewhat less than the Principal Incidence. 88 IREV. S.

This is shown in Plate VIII. fig. A, on which the values of (p are laid down for different angles of incidence in the two cases in which the azimuth of the incident light is 80? and 870. When the azimuth of the incident light is less than X, the circular v limit, the axis of the ellipse moves as in the annexed figure. Let P 0 A be the azimuth of the incident light, and Q 0 A equal to P 0 A; P O is the position of the axis major corresponding to 00 incidence; 0 A is the position of the axis major in the plane of incidence, corre0 sponding to the principal incidence; and 0 Q is the position of the axis corresponding to 900 incidence. When, however, the azimuth of the incident light is greater than Q the circular limit, the axis major moves from P to x, as in the annexed figure, then back from x to y, passing through o B at the principal incidence, and finally from y to Q. Let E/ P 0 A be the azimuth of the incident light, and Q 0 B equal to P 0 B. At the incidence 00, 0 P is the position of / the axis major; as the incidence increases from 0? to the |_Ad__;_-' principal incidence, the axis major moves from 0 P to 0 Xv and turns back, attaining the position 0 B at the principal incidence; and as the incident angle increases from the principal incidence to 90?, the axis major moves from 0 B to 0 Y, and back again to 0 Q. Having ascertained the truth of the preceding laws of the movement of the axis major of the elliptically polarized light, I made the following experiments. Having removed ~~~~~o2 92 REV. S. HAUGHTON ON THE REFLEXION the compensator, I set the polarizer at 880 and 89?, and found that the analyser gave a minimum of light at 90?, showing that the axis major of the ellipse was perpendicular to the plane of incidence. All the experiments already given were made with the Munich glass (a) No. 1. I made the following experiment with (a) No. 2, in order to establish fully the identity of the pieces of glass with regard to reflexion, as they are certainly identical in their refractive indices.

The compensator was then set at 47-12, which corresponds with a difference of phase of 900, between the principal components of the reflected light; and the compensator being thus set, the angle of incidence was determined by trial, for which the dark band was centrally placed. The incidence so found is the principal incidence. Having thus found the principal incidence, I changed the azimuth of the polarizer, and read the analyser, obtaining the following results.

This experiment shows that the fresh polishing of the surface affected the coefficient of refraction more than the coefficient of reflexion, on which the elliptic polarization altogether depends. The angle tan-'(I) is not constant, but attains a minimum at the circular limit. Additional direct experiments with speculum metal, such as setting the compensator at 90?, making the incidence 760, setting the analyser at 450, and then determining the azimuth of the polarizer, gave for the circular limit 540 45'.

HAIUGHTON ON THE REFLEXION The alloys from I to 11 are all yellowish, and from 12 to 14 are whitish. The following Table shows that the Coefficients of Refraction from 1 to 11 increase gradually, reaching a maximum at No. 6 (5 Cu+ Zn), and then diminish to No. 11, in passing from which to No. 12 the coefficient suddenly increases. The Coefficient of Reflexion follows an order somewhat similar, but suddenly decreases in passing from 11 to 12, which is the limit at which the zinc begins to preponderate over the copper, in producing the optical properties of the alloy. InPlate VIII. fig. B, I have tabulated the coefficients of refraction and reflexion of the alloys of copper and zinc, showing the progression of these constants, as just described.

Lead ........0-3265 The brilliancy of a metallic surface depends on the coefficient of refraction, and there is, doubtless, some sensible quality, not yet clearly defined, which corresponds to the coefficient of reflexion, which indicates the power of the surface to form elliptically polarized light from incident plane-polarized light. This quality might be provisionally named lustre. It is very remarkable that gold, silver, and copper, which from time immemorial have pleased the eye of man, and been used as coins, should head the list of bodies possessing a high coefficient of reflexion. Mercury, which has so brilliant a surface, and therefore heads the list in Table LXXII., occupies a comparatively low place in Table LXXXIII., probably owing to its being a liquid, and its surface, therefore, in a less favourable condition than that of a solid for imparting elliptic polarization to an incident beam. M. JAMIX has examined optically several of the substances mentioned in the preceding s2 124 REV. S. HA-UGHTON ON THE IREFLEXION Tables-the metallic bodies by the methods of equal intensities and multiple reflexions, and the transparent bodies by the method employed in this paper, and originally used by him. I have deduced from his original observations, the optical constants of the substances common to him and myself, and have recorded them for the purpose of comparison, 'in the two following Tables, LXXXIV. and LXXXV.* TABLE LXXXIV.-Opti'cal Constants of Metals, deduced from JAM IN'S experiments.
