(999) VI. An Account of a person who took a great quantity of Opium, without causing Sleep Newberry, Jan. 28. 170~/I. THere happened out here a very remarkable Case of one Mrs Lovelock, who had been seized ill of a Fever about eleven days before this instant; which affected her so, as to make her Light-headed to a great degree, Convulsed and restless; upon which the Physicians whose names are mentioned below, agreed to give her great quantities of Opiats, in order to compose her; but, as an instance against the sleeping quality of this Medicine, with the Doses below attested they could never procure any thing like sleep; but still as she took them they seem'd to refresh her, and make her sensible, but caused nothing of rest. And what was very remarkable, the good Women about her began at last to scruple her taking any more, upon a notion they had, that by the effects this Medicine was too high a Cordial for her, and still kept her waking; upon which her Physicians were forc'd to alter the form. The quantity she took from Tuesday night twelve a clock to Friday night twelve a clock was as follows. Jan. 29. 4 Boluses with two gr. each of Laud. Lond made up in Venice Treacle. Six Pills, with two grains each of the same. A Bolus with eight grains of the same in Ven. Treacle. Jan. 30. Twelve Pills with 2 grains each, and one Bolus with ten gr. of the same in Venice Treacle. Jan. 31. 4 Draughts with ten gr. of the said Laud Lond. one S s s s s s ounce (1000) ounce of Syr. de Mecon. in each Draught. So that in all she took in the time above-mentioned 102 gr. of Laud. Lond. and 3iij. of Venice Treacle, and ~iiij. of Syr. de Meconio. This is attested under the hands of her 3 Physicians, and the Apothecary. Dr Franc. Willis of Oxford. Dr Step. Flavell, Newberry. Dr John Cooke, Newberry. Ri.Fanner,~ Newbeery. Sign'd in the Presence of Rich. Smith, Rich. ~, and Robert Greenham. She Dyed the Ist of Febr. about 5 in the Afternoon.
