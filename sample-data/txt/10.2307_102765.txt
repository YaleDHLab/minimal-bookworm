V. An Extract of a Letter from Dr James Burrough, to Mr Houghton, F. R. S. concerning a Bulimia. ABout a month ago at Stanton (seven miles off this place) a labouring man,of middle age,had for some time so inordinate an Appetite, that I had it attested to me from an Eye-witness, that he eat up an ordinary Leg of Veal roasted at a meal; and fed at such an extravagant rate for many days together: He would eat Sow-thistles,and divers other Herbs as greedily, during the time his ~ lasted, as the Beasts that are wont to use such food; and all he could get was little enough to satisfy his hunger. I am told he voided divers Worms as long as an ordinary Tobacco-pipe, and some of them bigger about than the shank of a common Tobacco-pipe is.

He can't do so good a days work now as he was wont, but has almost recovered his wonted strength again. Bury, Jun. 26. 1700.
