[ 231 ] VII. A Miernoir on Cidid Surfaces. By Professor CAYLEY, F.R.S. Received November 12, 1868,-Read January 14, 1869. THE present Memoir is based upon, and is in a measure supplementary to that by Professor SCHLXPLI, " On the Distribution of Surfaces of the Third Order into Species, in reference to the presence or absence of Singular Points, and the reality of their Lines," Phil. Trans. vol. cliii. (1863) pp. 193-241. But the object of the Memoir is different. I disregard altogether the ultimate division depending on the reality of the lines, attending only to the division into (twenty-two, or as I prefer to reckon it) twenty-three cases depending on the nature of the singularities. And I attend to the question very much on account of the light to be obtained in reference to the theory of Reciprocal Surfaces. The memoir referred to furnishes in fact a store of materials for this purpose, inasmuch as it gives (partially or completely developed) the equations in plane-coordinates of the several cases of cubic surfaces, or, what is the same thing, the equations in point-coordinates of the several surfaces (orders 12 to 3) reciprocal to these repectively. I found by examination of the several cases, that an extension was required of Dr. SALMON'S theory of Reciprocal Surfaces in order to make it; applicable to the present subject; and the preceding " Memoir on the Theory of Reciprocal Surfaces" was written in connexion with these investigations on Cubic Surfaces. The latter part of the Memoir is divided into sections headed thus;:-" Section= I=12, equation (X, Y, Z, W)3=0 " &c. referring -to the several cases of the cubic surface; but the paragraphs are numbered continuously through the Memoir. The twenty-three Cases of Cubic Surfaces-Explanations and Table of Singularities. Article Nos. I to 13. 1.

The affixed explanation, which I shall usually retain in connexion witli the Roman number, shows therefore in each case what the class is, and also the singularities which cause the reduction: thus XIII = 12-B3-2C2 indicates that there is a biplanar node, B3, diminishing the class by 3, and two conic-nodes, 02, each diminishing the class by 2; and thus that the class is 12-3-2.2, =5. As regards the cases XXII and XXIII, these are surfaces having a nodal right line, and are consequently scrolls, each of the class 3, viz. XXII is the scroll S(1, 1) having a simple directrix right line distinct from the nodal line, and XXIII is the scroll S(1, 1) having a simple directrix right line coincident with the nodal line: see as to this my " Second Memoir on Skew Surfaces, otherwise Scrolls," Phil. Trans. vol. cliv. (1864) pp. 559-577. 3. The nature of the points 02, 133, 14 B., B36, U6, U7, U8 requires to be explained. C(=C2) is a conic-node, where, instead of the tangent plane, we have a proper quadric cone. B(=B3, B4, 35 or 36) is a biplanar-node, where the quadric cone becomes a plane-pair (two distinct planes): the two planes are called the biplanes, and their line of intersection is the edge,: In B), the edge is not a line on the surface-in the other cases it is; this implies that the surface is touch ed along the edge bya plane, viz, in 134, 3 the edge is torsal, in 4 it is oscu~lar: PROFESSOR CAYLEY ON CUBIC SURFACES. 233 In B4, the tangent plane is distinct from each of the biplanes: In B5, the tangent plane coincides with one of the biplanes; we have thus an ordinary biplane, and a torsal biplane: In B6, the tangent plane coinciding with one of the biplanes becomes oscular; we have thus an ordinary biplane, and an oscular biplane. U(==U6, U7 or U8) is a uniplanar-node, where the quadric cone becomes a coincident plane-pair; say, the plane is the uniplane. It is to be observed that there is not in this case any edge. The uniplane meets the cubic surface in three lines, or say " rays," passing through the uniplanar-node, viz. In U6, the rays are three distinct lines: In U7, two of them coincide: In U8, they all three coincide. 4. To connect these singular points with the theory of the preceding Memoir, it is to be observed that they aie respectively equivalent to a certain number of the cnicnodes C(=C2) and binodes B(=B3), viz. we, haveC2= C, B3 = B, B4=2C, 35 = C0 B, fB6=3Cj tU6= 30, J7-2C+ B, U8= C+2B. 5. I take the opportunity of remarking that although the expressions cnicnode and binode properly refer to the simple singularities C and B, yet as C2=C, 02 is properly spoken of as a cnicnode, and we may (using the term binode as an abbreviation for biplanar-node) speak of any of the singularities B3, B4, B8, B6 as a binode. Thus the surface X~12 B4-. 0a has a binode B4 and a cuicuode C2; although theoretically the binode B4 is equivalent to two cnicnodes, and the surface belongs to those with three cnicnodes, or for which C-3. I use also the expression unode for shortness, instead of uniplanar-node, to denote any of the singularities U6, U7J US. 6. The foregoing equations (substantially the same as SCHLXFLI'S) are canonical forms; the reduction of the equation of any case of surface to the above form is not always obvious. It would appear that each equation is from its simplicity in the form best adapted to the separate discussion of the surface to which it belongs; there is. the disadvantage that the equations do not always (when from the geometrical connexion of the surfaces they ought to do so) lead the one to the other; for instance, V=12-B4 incdudes VII= 12-w B., but we cannot from the equation WXZ+ (X+Z)(Y2-CaX2-bZ2) 0 of the former pass to the equation WXZ+Y2Z+YX2_X%=0 of the latter. This would be a serious imperfection if the object were to form a theory of the quaternary function MDcccLxIx. 2xE 2`34 PROFESSORR CAYLEY ON CUBIC S FACESAd.

(X, Y, Z, V) in. place of SCHLXFLI'S (x, yl, Z,. w), reserving these in place of his (p, q, r, s). for plane-coordinates of the cubic' surfaces, or (what is the same. thing) point-coordinates of the. reciprocal surfaces; but I have in several cases interchanged the coordinates (X, Y, Z,,WNV) so, that. they do not int this order correspond to SCHuLi', U'S (x, Z, w) : this has been done so, as, to obtain a greater uniformity in the representation of the surfaces. I To explain this, let, A, B, C, I D be the; vertices of the tetrahedron formed by the coordinate planes A=YZW,, B-ZWX, C=WXY, D=XYZ; the coordinate planes have been chosen so. that determinate vertices of the tetrahedron shall correspond to determinate singularities. of the surface. 8. Consider firstt the surfaces which. have no nodes B. or U.... It is. clear that. the nodes C2 might have been. taken at, any vertices whatever of the; tetrahedron;,, they are taken thus: there is always a node C2 at D; when there is a. second. no-de C2, this is, at: C, the, third one is at A, and the fourth at B. 9. Consider next the surfaces which have a binode B3, B4, B5, or B6; this is taken to be at D, and the biplanes to be X=0, Z=O* (the edge being therefore DB), viz. in B5 or B6, where the distinction arises, X=0 is the ordinary biplane, Z= 0 the torsal or (as the case may be) oscular biplane. If there is a second node, this of necessity lies in an ordinarybiplane; it maybe and is taken to be in the biplane X= 0, at C. I suppose for a moment that this is a node C2. It is only when the binode is B3 or B4 that there can be a third node, for it is only in these cases that there is a second ordinary biplane Z 0; but in these cases respectively the third node, a C2, may be and is taken to be in the biplane Z = 0, at A. ItO. The only case of two binodes. is when each is a B3. Here the first is as above 'at D, its biplanes being X=0, Z.=0-; and the second is as above in the biplane X=0, at. C; the, biplanes thereof are then X= 0 (which is thus a biplane common to the two binodes,., or say a., common biplane),. and a remaining biplane which may be and is taken to be. W= 0. If there is a: third node, this may be either C2 or B3, but it will in either case lie in. the biplane Z = 0 of the first binode, and also in the biplane W= 0 of the second binode, that. is, in the line BA;. and it may be and is taken to be at. A; if a binode, then its biplanes are of necessity Z=0, W=0; and the plane Y=0 will be the plane through the three binodes ID, C, A. 11. If there is a unode, then this maybe and is taken to be at D, and its uniplane may be taken to be. X=0;. in the surfaceXII=12-U6 the uniplane is, however, taken to be X+Y+Z=0. There is never, besides the unode, any other node. 12. The result is that the nodes, in the order of their speciality, are in the equations. taken to be at D, C, A, B, respectively; and that (except., in. the case III 12 -B3) the biplanes of the., first. binode are X0, Z = 0 (for a binode B.5 or B6, X 0 being, the ordinary biplane,. Zi= 0. the. special biplane), those of the second binode X 0,: W= 0, * In the ecase, however, of a single :B3, lIII=12-IBa, thebiplanes are taken to be X+Y+Z=O,. IX d m7Y + nZ= 0.

For example, in the ~surface XVII=12-2B,3-C, as represented by its ~equation WXZ +Y'Z+ X'=O, we -have a B. Iat D. the biplanes being X =O,;Z=0, a B, at C, the biplanes being X=O, W=O0 (therefore X=O the common biplane), and a C2 at A. 13.

Explanatio n regard to the determination of the n umber of certain singularities. Article Nos. 14 to 19. 14. In the several cases I to XXI, we have a cubic surface (n= 3). with singular points C and B but without singular lines. The section by an arbitrary plane is thus a curve, order n= 3, that is, a cubic curve, without nodes or cusps, and therefore of the class a'=6, having 1'=0 double tangents and x' =9 inflexions. The tangent cone with an arbitrary point as vertex is a cone of the order a=6, having in the case I=12 t=0 nodal lines and z=6 cuspidal lines, but with (in the several other cases) C nodal lines and B cuspidal lines (or rather singular lines tantamount to C double lilies and B cuspidal lines): the class of the cone, or order of the reciprocal surface, is thus n'=6. 5-2(0+C)3(6+B)=12-2B-3C. 15. In the general case I=12, there are on the cubic surface 27 lines, lying by 3's in 45 planes; these 27 lines constitute the node-couple curve of the order e'=27, and the node-couple torse consists of the pencils of planes through these lines respectively, being thus of the class ?'=6'=27; the 45 planes are triple tangent planes of the node-couple torse, which has thus t'=45 triple tangent planes. But in the other cases it is only certain of the 27 lines, say the "facultative lines" (as will be explained), which constitute the node-couple curve -of the order I': the pencils of planes through these lines constitute the node-couple torse of the class 6' I='; the t' planes, each containing three facultative lines, are the triple tangent planes of the node-couple torse. Or if (as is somewhat more convenient) we refer the numbers 6', t' to the reciprocal surface, then the lines, reciprocals of the facultative lines, constitute the nodal curve of the order 6'; and the points t', each containing three of these lines, are the triple points of the nodal curve. Inasmuch as the nodal curve consists of right lines, the number k' of its apparent double points is given by the formula 2k' =b2_ '-61'; and comparing with the formula _~b/2 2k-2/-b-6t', we have q'+3r'-0, that is, q'=0 (q' the class of the nodal curve), and also r'=0. 16. In the general case I=12, the spinode curve is the complete intersection of the cubic surface by the Hessian surface of the order 4, and it is thus of the order d'=12; but in the other cases the complete intersection consists of the spilnode curve together with certain right lines not belonging to the curve, and the spinode curve is of an order a' less than 12: this will be further explained, -and the reduction accounted for (see post, Nos. 24 et seq.). 17. Again, in the general case 1=12, each of the 27 lines is a double tangent of the spinode curve, and the tangent planes of the surface at the points of contact are common tangent planes of the spinode torse and the node-couple torse, stationary planes of the spinode torse; or we have 23' 2-'54. In the other cases, however, instead of the 27 lines we must take only the facultative linles, each of which is or is not a double or a single tangent of the spinode curve; and the tangent planes of the surface at the points of contact are the common tangent planes as above-that is, the number of contacts gives f3', not in genelral= 2?'. PROFESSOR CAYLEY ON CUBIC SURFACES. 237 18. There are not, except as above, any common tangent planes of the two torses, that is, not only r'=0 as already mentioned, but also i=0. I do not at present account a priori.for the values O'=16, 8, and 16, which present themselves in the Table. The cubic surface cannot have a plane of conic contact, and we have thus in every case 01=0; but the value of B' is not in every case = 0. 19. In what precedes we see how a discussion of the equation of the cubic surface should in the several cases respectively lead to the values 1/, t, i u1, JY, t., c', B', and how in the reciprocal surface the nodal curve of the order b' is known by means of the facultative lines of the original cubic surface. The cuspidal curve c' might also be obtained as the reciprocal of the spinode-torse; but this would in general be a laborious process, and it is the less necessary, inasmuch as the equation of the reciprocal surface is in each case obtained in a form putting in evidence the cuspidal curve. lThe Lines and Planes of a Cubic Surface; Facultative Lines; Explanation of -Diagrams. Article Nos. 20 to 23. 20. In the general surface 1=12, we have 27 lines and 45 triple-tangent planes, or say simply, planes: through each line pass 5 planes, in each plane lie 3 lines. For the surfaces II to XXI (the present considerations do not of course apply to the Scrolls) several of the lines come to coincide with each other, and several of the planes also come to coincide with each other; but the number of the lines is always reckoned as 27, and that of the planes as 45. If we attend to the distinct lines and the distinct planes, ,each line has a multiplicity, and the sum of these is= 27; and so each plane has a multiplicity, and the sum of these is=45. Again, attending to a particular line in a particular plane, the line has a frequency 1, 2, or 3, that is, it represents 1, 2, or 3 of the 3 lines in the plane (this is in fact the distinction of a scrolar, torsal, or oscular line); and similarly, the plane has a frequency 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5, according to the number which it represents of the 5 planes through the line. It requires only a little consideration to perceive that the multiplicity of the plane into its frequency in regard to the line is equal to the multiplicity of the line into its frequency inregard to the plane. Observe, further, that if M be the multiplicity of the plane, then, considering it in regard to the lines contained therein, we get the products (M, M, M), (2M, M), or 3M, according as the three lines are or are not distinct, but that the sum of the products is always3M and that in regard to all the planes the total sum is 3 X 45, = 135. And so if M' be the multiplicity of the line, then, considering it in regard to the planes which pass through it, we get the products (M', M', M', M', M'), (2M', M', M', M') . . . (5M'), as the case may be, but that the sum of the products is =5M', and that in regard to all the lines the sum is 5 x 27, =135, as before. 21. The mode of coincidence of the lines and planes, and the several distinct lines and planes which are situate in or pass through the several distinct planes and lines respectively, are shown in the annexed diagrams I to XXI*: the multiplicity of each line * See the commencements of the several sections. 23 8 PROFESSOR CAYLEY ON CUBIC SURFACES'. appears by the upper m arginal line, and that of each plane by the left-hand marginal column (thus in diagram I, 27 X 1-27 and 45 x 1=45, 1 -is the multiplc4ity ofeach line; and it is also the multiplicity of each plane); -the frequencies of a line and plane in regard to each other appear by the dots in the suare opposite to the line and plane in question, these being read, for the frequency of the line vertically, and for the frequency of the plane horizontally; thus * indicates that the frequency of the line is =3, and the frequency of the plane is _2. 'There should be and are in every line of the diagram 3 dots, and in every column of the diagram 5 dots (a symbol being read as just explained, 2 dots in the line, 3 .dots in the column). 22. For the surface 1=12, there 'is of course no .distinction between the lines, but these form only a single class, and the like for the planes; but for the other surfaces the lines and planes form separate classes, as shown in the diagrams by the lower marginal explanation of the lines, and the right-hand marginal explanation of the planes. I use here and elsewhere "' ray" to denote a line passing through a single node; "axis" to denote a line joining two nodes; -" edge" (as 'above) to denote the edge of a binode; any other line is a "m mere line." An axis is always torsal or oscular; when it is torsal, the plane touching along the axis contains a third line which is the "transversal" of such axis; but a transversal may be a mere line, a ray, or an axis; in the case XVI_ 1242, each transversal is a transversal in regard to two axes. 23. In the general case I=12, each of the 27 lines is, as already mentioned, part of the node-couple curve; and the node-couple curve is made up of the 27 lnes, and is thus a curve of the order 27. In fact each plane through a line meets the cubicsurface in this line, and in a conic; the line and conic meet in two points, and the plane (that is in any plane) through the line is thus a double tangent plane touching the surface at fthe two points in question; the locus of the points of contact, -that is the line'itself, is thus part of the node-couple curve. But in the other cases, II to XXI, certain of the lines do not belong -to 'the node-couple curve (this will be examined in detail in the several cases respectively); but I wish to show here 'how in a general way a line passing through a node, say a nodal ray, is not part of the node-couple curve. To fix the ideas, consider the surface II=12-C2; there are here through 02 six lines, or say rays: attending to any one of these, a plane through the ray meets the surface in the ray Uitself and in a conic; the ray and the conic meet as 'before in two points, one of them being the point 02: the plane touches the surface at the other point, but it does not touch the surface -at 02. (I am not sure, and I leave it an open question, whether we ought to say that at a node 02 there is no tangent plane, or to say that only the tangent planes of the nodal cone are tangent planes of the surface; but, at any rate, an arbitrary plane through 0C2 is not a tangent plane.) The plane through the ray is -only a -single tangent plane, not a double tangent plane; and the ray is not part of the node-couple curve. We say that a line of the surface is or is not " facultative" according as it does or does not form part of the node-couple curves PROFESSOR CAYLEY ON CUBIC SURFACES. 239 A xis;tthe.-dfferet kinds thereof Article. Nos.. 24 tow 26'. 24. A line joining two nodes is anaxis; such. a line is always a. line, and it is a torsal or oscular line, of the surface.. But. somer further distinctions are requisite; using the expressions in their strict sense, cnicnode =C, binode =B, an axis is a CC-axis joining two cnicnodes, or it is a, CB-axis joining a. cnicnode and a binode, or it is a BB,-axis joining two binodes. A CC-axis. is torsal, the transversal being a mere line, not a ray through either of the cnicnodes; a CB-axis. is torsal, the transversal being a ray of the binode; a BB-axis is oscular. The distinction is of course carried through as regards the higher biplanar nodes B4, B5, B6, and the uniplanar nodes U6, 1 U1, 18: thus (B =B) the edge of a binode B5 is not an axis at all, but (B4=2C) the edge of a binode B, 'is a CC-axis; (B5=B+C) the edge of a binode B5 is a CB-axis; (B6=3C) the edge of a binode B6 is a thrice-taken CC-axis; (16= 3C) each of the rays is regarded as a CC-axis; (U7=B2C) the double ray is regarded as a twice-taken CB-axis, and the single ray as a CC-axis; (U8=2B+C) the rayis regarded as a BB-axis + a twice-taken CB-axis. 25. It has been mentioned that the intersection of the surface with the Hessian consists of the spinode curve, together with certain right lines; these lines are in fact the axes-viz. the examination of the several cases shows that in the complete intersection each CC-axis presents itself twice, each CB-axis 3 tim'es, and each BB-axis 4 times. We thus see that a CC-axis, or rather the torsal plane along such, axis, is the pinch-plane or singularity j'=I; the CB-axis, or rather the torsal plane along such axis, the closeplane, or singularity ,'=I; and the BB-axis, or oscular. plane along such axis, the bitrope, or singularity B'=1; for a cubic surface with singular lines the expression of a' being in fact o'= 12 2j'3X' 4B'. There are, however, some cases requiring explanation; thus for the case VIII 12 -B5 where the edge is by what precedes a CB-axis, the complete intersection is made up of the edge 4 times and of an octic curve; the consideration of the reciprocal surface shows, however, that the edge taken once is really part of the spinode curve (viz. that this curve is made up of the edge taken once and of the, octic curve, its order being thus 6/= 9); and the interpretation then of course is that the intersection is made up of the edge taken 3 times (as for a CB-axis it should be) and of the spinode curve. 26. I remark in further explanation, that in the several sections, in showing how the complete intersection of the cubic surface with the Hessian is made up, I have not referred to the axes in the above precise significations; thus XIV= 12-B5-C2, the binode B5 is C+ B, and the edge is thus a CB-axis, while the axis B5C2 is a CB-axis + a CC-axis (z'=I1+1 =2, 2'51). The complete intersection should therefore consist of the spinode curve, + edge (as a CB-axis) 3 times + axis (as a CB-axis + a CC-axis) 2 +3, =5 times: it is in the section stated (in perfect consistency herewith, but without the full explanation) that the intersection is made up of the axis 5 times, the edge 4 times, and a cubic curve-which cubic curve together with the edge once constitutes the spinode curvae; and so in other cases: this explanation will, I think, remove all difficul~ty..240 PROFESSOR CAYLEY ON CUBIC SURFACES. On the .Determination of the Becijrocal Equation. Article Nos. 27 to 32. 27. Consider in general the cubic surface (*X(X, Y, Z, W)3=0, and in connexion therewith the equation Xx +Yy+ Zz +Ww = O, which regarding therein X, Y, Z, Was current coordinates, and x, y, z, w as constants, is the equation of a plane. If from the two equations we eliminate one of the coordinates, for instance W, we obtain (*OXw, Yw, ZW, -(XX+yy+Zz))3=0 which, (X, Y, Z) being current coordinates,-is obviously the equation of the cone, vertex (X=0, Y-0= Z-O), which stands on the section of the cubic surface by the plane. Equating to zero the discriminant of this function in regard to (X, Y, Z), we express that the cone has a nodal line; that is, that the section has a node, or, what is the same thing, that the plane xX+yY+ZZ+wW=O is a tangent plane of the cubic surface; and we thus by the process in fact obtain the equation of the cubic surface in the reciprocal or plane coordinates (x, y, z, w). Consider in the same equation x, y, z, w as current coordinates, (X, Y, Z) as given parameters, the equation represents a system of three planes, viz. these are the planes xX+yY+zZ+wW'=O, where W' has the three values given by the equation (*EX, Y, Z, W')3= 0, or, what is the same thing, X, AY Z W' are the coordinates of any one of the three points of intersection of the cubic surface by the line X-'y=z; (X, Y, Z, W') belongs to a point on the surface, and X+yY+zZ +wW'=O is the polar plane of this point in regard to a quadric surface X2+Y2+Z2+W%0_O; the equation (*XXw, Yw, Zw, -(Xs+Yy+Zz))'=0 is thus the equation of a system of 3 planes, the polar planes of three points of the cubic surface (which three points lie on an arbitrary line through the point 0, y=O, z=0). In equating to zero the discriminant in regard to (X, Y, Z), we find the envelope of the system of three planes, or say of a plane, the polar plane of an arbitrary point on the cubic surface,-or we have the equation of the reciprocal surface, being, as is known, the same thing as the equation of the cubic surface in the reciprocal or plane coordinates (x, y, z, w). In what precedes we have the explanation of an ordinary process of finding the equation of the reciprocal surface, this equation being thereby given by equating to zero the discriminant of a function (*AX, Y, Z)3, that is, of a ternary cubic function. 28. The process, as last explained, is a special one, viz. the position of a point on the surface is determined by means of certain two parameters, the ratios X: Y: Z which fix the position of the line joining this point with the point (x=0, y=O, z=O). More generally we may consider the position of the point as determined by means of any two parameters; the equation of the polar plane then contains the two parameters, and bytaking the envelope in regard to the two parameters considered as variable, we have the equation of the reciprocal surface. 29. RBut let the parameters, say S, ,A be regarded as varying successively; if t alone PROFESSOR CAYLEY ON CUBIC SURFACES. 241 vary, we have on the surface a curve 0, the equation whereof contains the parameter 0, and when 0 varies this curve sweeps over the surface. The envelope in regard to i of the polar plane of a point of the surface is a torse, the reciprocal of the curve 0, and the envelope of the torse is the reciprocal surface. In particular the curve 0 may be the plane section by any plane through a fixed line, say, by the plane P -0 Q= 0; the section is a cubic curve, the reciprocal is a sextic cone having its vertex in a fixed line (the reciprocal of the line P = 0, Q= 0), and the reciprocal surface is thus obtained as the envelope of this cone; assuming that the equation of the sextic cone has been obtained, this is an equation of a certain order in the parameter d; or writing d=P: Q, we obtain the equation of the reciprocal surface by equating to zero the discriminant of a binary function of (P, Q). 30. With a variation, this process is a convenient one for obtaining the reciprocal of a cubic surface: we take the fixed line to be one of the lines on the cubic surface; the curve 0 is then a conic, its reciprocal is a quadricone, and the envelope of this quadricone is the required reciprocal surface. This is really what SCHL.iFLI does (but the process is not explained) in the several instances in which he obtains the equation of the reciprocal surface by means of a binary function. I remark that it would be very instructive, for each case of surface, to take the variable plane successively through the several kinds of lines on the particular surface; the equation of the reciprocal surface would thus be obtained under different forms, putting in evidence the relation to the reciprocal surface of the fixed line made use of. But this is an investigation which I do not enter upon: I adopt in each case SCHLAFLI'S process, without explanation, and merely write down the ternary or (as the case may be) binary function by means of which the equation of the reciprocal surface is obtained. 31. It is to be mentioned that there is a reciprocal process of obtaining the equation of the reciprocal surface; we may imagine, touching the cubic surface along any curve, a series of planes; that is, a torse circumscribed about the surface, and the equation whereof contains a variable parameter 0; the reciprocal figure is a curve, the equations whereof contain the parameter 0; the locus of this curve is the reciprocal surface; that is, the equation of the reciprocal surface is obtained by eliminating d from the equations of the curve. In particular let the torse be the circumscribed cone having its vertex at any point of a fixed line; the reciprocal figure is then a plane curve, the plane of which passes through the line which is the reciprocal of the fixed line; it is moreover clear that if the position of the vertex on the fixed line be determined by the parameter 0 linearly (for instance if the vertex be given as the intersection of the fixed line by a plane P-.-Q=0), then the equation of the plane of the curve will be of the form P'= 0Q', containing the parameter 0 linearly; the other equation of the plane curve will contain 0 rationally, and the elimination will be at once effected by substituting in this other equation for 0 its value, P' + Q'. And observe moreover that if the fixed line be a line on the cubic surface, then the cone is a quadricone having for its reciprocal a conic; the reciprocal surface is thus given as the locus of a variable conic, the plane of MWCcCLxIx. 2 L 242 PROFESSOR CAYLEY ON. CUBIC SURFACES. which always passes through a fixed line; there are thus on the reciprocal surface series of such conics. It would be-very instructive and interesting to carry out the investigation in detail. 32. The equation of the reciprocal surface is found by equating to zero the discriminant of a ternary or a binary function*, viz. this is a ternary cubic, or a binary quartic, cubic, or quadric. The equation as given in the form disct.=0, contains a factor which for the adopted forms of equations is always a power or product of powers of w, z, xjt known cpriori, and which is thrown out without difficulty, the equation being thereby reduced to the proper order. There is the singular advantage that the, process puts in evidence the cuspidal curve of the resulting reciprocal surface, viz. for a ternary cubic, the form obtained is S3-TT= 0, and for a binary quartic it is the equivalent form I327J2 =; but for the factor thrown out as just mentioned, we should have simply (S =0, T=0), or, as the case may be, (I=0, J =0) for equations of the cuspidal curve; the existence of the factor occasions however a modification, viz. the intersection of the two surfaces is not an indecomposable curve, and the cuspidal curve is in most cases, not the complete intersection, but a partial intersection of the two surfaces. In several cases it thus happens that the cuspidal curve is obtained as a curve 0R<=() without or with further speciality. Similarly when the equation of the reciprocal surface is obtained by means of a binary cubic; if the coefficients hereof (functions of course of the coordinates x, y, z, w) be A, B, C, D, then the surface is (AD BC)2 4(AC B2)(BDRC2) = 0, having the cuspidal curve ) B, DC =? subject however to modification in the case of a thrown out factor.

As regards the following Sections I to XXIII, it is to be observed that for the general surface I=12, I do not attempt to form the equation of the reciprocal surface, and in some of the other cases, II=12 C2 &c., the equation of the reciprocal surface is either not obtained in a completely developed form, or it is too complicated to allow of its being dealt with, for instance so as to put in evidence the nodal curve of the surface. Portions of the theory given in the latter sections are consequently omitted in the earlier ones, and in particular in the Section I there is given only the diagram of the 27 lines and the 45 planes (with however developments as to notation and otherwise which have no place in the subsequent sections), and with the analytical expressions for the several lines @ In soeie easy cases, for instance XVI=124C,, the equation of the reciprocal surface is obtained otherwise by a direct elimination.. It The factor is in general a power or product of powers of the linear functions which, equated to zero, give the equations of the planes reciprocal to the several nodes of the surface. PROFESSOR CAYLEY ON CUBIC SURFACES. '243 and planes, although from the want of the equation of the reciprocal surface these analytical expressions have no present application. And so in some of the next followTinog sections, no application is made of the analytical expressions of the lines and planes. 34. I call to mind that if a line be given as the intersection of the two planes AX+BY+CZ+DW=O., A'X+B'Y+C'Z+D'W=-O then the six coordinates of the line are a, 6, c, g, h -AD'-A'D, BD'-B'D,, CD'-C'D, BC'-B'C, CA'-C'A, AB'-A'B, and that in terms of its six coordinates the line is given as the common intersection of the four planes ( .t h, -g, a )CX, Y, Z, W)=O. -Ii, . f, 6 -a, -6, -c, and that (reciprocating as usual in regard to X2+Y2+Z2+W2=0) the coordinates of the reciprocal line are (f, g, h, a, 6, c); that is, this is the common intersection of the four planes c . a, g l 6, -a, .it -f, -eg, -It,. It is in some cases more convenient to consider a line as determined as the intersection of two planes rather than by means of its six coordinates; thus, for instance, to speak of the line X=0, Y=O rather than of the line (0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0); and in some of the sections I have preferred not to give the expressions of the six coordinates of the several lines. ?

There is in the system of the 27 lines and the 45 planes a complicated and manysided symmetry which precludes the existence of any unique notation: the notation can only be obtained by starting from some arrangement which is not unique, but one of a system of several like arrangements. The notation employed in my original paper "' On the Simple Tangent Planes of Surfaces of the Third Order," Camb. and Dub. Math. Journ. vol. iv. 1849, pp. 118-132, and which is shown in the right hand and lower margins of the diagram, starts from such an arrangement; but it is so complicated that it can hardly be considered as at all putting in evidence the relations of the lines and planes; that of Dr. HART (SALMON " On the Triple Tangent Planes of a Surface of the Third Order," same volume, pp. 252-260), depending on an arrangement of the 27 lines according to a cube of 3 each wtay, is a singularly elegant one, and wtill be presently repiodulced. 2 L2 244 PROFESSOR CAYLEY ON CUBIC SURFACES. 36. But the most convenient one is SCHLXiFLI'S, starting from a double-sixer; viz. we can (and that in 36 different ways) select out of the 27 lines two systems each of six lines, such that no two lines of the same system intersect, but that each line of the one system intersects all but the corresponding line of the other system; or, say, if the lines are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 1,, 2', 31, 41, 51, 6', then these have the thirty intersections 1', 2', 3', 4', 51, 6' 2 . . . . 3 0 0 0 0 4 0 . . 0 5 0 0 0 0 6 . . . . Any two lines such as 1, 2' lie in a plane which may be called 12'; similarly the lines 1', 2 lie in a plane which may be called 1'2; these two planes meet in a line 12; and any three lines such as 12, 34, 56 meet in pairs, lying in a plane 12. 34. 56. We have thus the entire system of the 27 lines and 45 planes, as in effect completely explained by what has been stated, but which is exhibited in full in the diagram. 37.

We can out of the 45 planes select, and that in 120 ways, a trihedral-pair, that is two triads of planes, such that the planes of the one triad, intersecting those of the other triad, give 9 of the 27 lines.

Thus Al lies in the planes Alala,, Alb32, Ac37, (and in the before-mentioned two planes AIA,A,, 41. I find that one way in which this may be identified with the double-sixer notation is to represent the above arrangement by 1, 2', 12 3', 4 , 34 13 , 24, 56 14, 25, 36 2, 6', 26 1', 16, 6 4', 5, 45 23, 46, 15 3, 35, 5' and then the identification may apparently be effected in (720 x 36 =) 25920 ways, viz, we may first in any way permute the IL P, g1 31, 4, 35 6, by this means not altering the double-sixer 1, 2 3 4 5 6, and then upon the arrangements so obtained make any of the substitutions which permute inter se the 36 double-sixers. 42.

Hence the 27 lines of the reciprocal surface may be (and that in 36 different ways) represented by PROFESSOR CAYLEY ON CUBIC SURFACES. 25& 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 1', 2', 3!, 4', 5!, 6' 12, 13,.... 56, wohere 12 is now the line joining the points 12' and 1'2; and so for the other lines.

The above equation, S3-T2=0, shows that the cuspidal curve is a complete interseetion 6 x 4; c'=24. Section I1= 12-C2. Equation W(a, b, cy, , jX, Y, Z)2+21kXYZ0. Article Nos. 47 to 59. 47. It may be remarked that the system of lines and planes is at once deduced fron that belonging to I=12, by supposing that in the double-sixer the corresponding lines I and r, &c. severally coincide; the line 12, instead of being given as the intersection of the planes 12', 1'2, is given as the third line in the plane 12, which in fact represents the coincident planes 12' and 1'2. 256 PROFESSOR CAYLEY ON CUBIC SURFACES. 48.

Resuming the equation W(a, b, cjf, g, h:(X, Y, Z)2+2kXYZ=O, the equation of the Hessian surface is found to be KWV2(a, 6, cf g hX, Y, Z)2 ?2kW{(ca, b, c, g, lq(X, Y, Z)2(FX+GY+HIIZ)-3KXYZ} 7g2 {2aX4+b2Y4+ c2Z4-_ 1cYZ2 Z2X2 Y2 4XYZ[(af ggh)X+ (byg+f)Y + (ch+fg)Z] }O where (A, B, C, F, GI H)=(bc-f2, ca g2, ab-2P gh-afl, h f-bg, fg-ca), K = abc-cf 2 _ 6g2 _ ch2 + 2fgh. The Hessian and the cubic intersect in an indecomposable curve, which is the spinode curve; that is, spinode curve is a complete intersection 3 X 4; %'= 12. The equations of the spinode curve may be written in the simplified form W(a, 6, c, , h(X, Y, Z)2+2JcXYZ=O, -8KXYZW + SkXYZ(afX+ bgY + chZ) -k2{a2X4 + aX 2+Y4+ cZ4-2bcY2Z2 2caZ2X22abX2Y} 0; and it appears hereby that the node C2 is a sixfold point on the curve, the tangents of the curve in fact coinciding with the six rays. Each of the 15 lines touches the spinode curve twice; in fact, for the line 12 we have X= 0, W= O; and substituting in the equations of the spinode curve, we have (bY1-cZ2)=0; that is, we have the two points of contact X=O, W-0, YVb=?ZVc. Hence i'=30. Reciprocal Surface. 53. The equation is found by equating to zero the discriminant of the ternary cubic function (XX+Yy+Zz)(ca 6, c,f, g, h(X, Y, Z)2-2kwXYZ, viz. the discriminant contains the factor w2 which is to be thrown out, thus reducing the order to n'== 10.

In explanation of the discussion of the reciprocal surface, it is convenient to remark that we have Node C2, X=0, Y=0, Z=Q. Reciprocal plane is wO0. Tangent cone is Conic of contact is (a, 6, c, f, q, hXX, Y, Z)=0. (A, B, C, F, G, HEx, y, Z)2=0, toO. Nodal rays are sections of cone by planes Lines are taingents of this conic from points X=OY=O Z-O respectively viz. equa (Y-O, z=O), (zO0, x=0), (0, y=O) tions of the rays are respectively, viz., equations are X=O, bY2+2 YZ+c Z2=O W 0 Cy22fyz + bz2z=O, Y=O. c Z2 +2gZX+aCY2=_O wt=O, az2-2gzx + cV2 =O, Z =O, aX2+2hXY+bY 62= 0. w=O. X2 _-2hxy+ay2=O. 57. TThe equation shows that the section by the plane w=O is made up of the conic (A, 13, C, F, GI HJ , y, Z)2= 0, twice, and of the six lines, tangent to thisconic, viz. the lines W=O, cfY-2f_,,zZ2=0O W=0, az2.-2gzx+ce2=0, w=O, bX2-2hxy+a'y2= 0 each once; the lines in question (reciprocals of the nodal rays) are thus mere scrolar lines on tie reciprocal surface. 58. I do not attempt to put in evidence the nodal curve of the surface; by what precedes it is made up of 15 liles, inte-secting 3 together in 15 points; and if we denote the six tangents of the conic just referred to be 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, then the fifteen lines are respectively lines passing through the intersections of each pair of these tangents; viz. through the intersection of the tangents 1 and 2, we have a line 12; and so in other cases; that is, the 1o lines are 12, 13 .4 * 56. The lines 12 and 34 meet; and the lines 12, 34, 56 meet in a point; we have thus the 15 points 12. 34. 56, triple points of the nodal curve. 59. As regards the cuspidal curve, the equation of the surface may be written (L-2_ 12kwM)(4M2? 3LN) -(LML+ 9kwN)2 3(L 2M2 L N18kwLMN l6JcwM3-27k 2W 2N2)=0, and we thus have 4M2+ 3LN =02 LM + 9kwN=0 L2 -l12JwM=0 or, what is the same thing, L L, 12M, -9N1=0 kw,) L, M PRO: ESSOR CAYLEY ON CUBIC SUJRFACES. 263 (equivalent to two equations) for the equatlons of the cuspidal curve.

The system of lines and planes is at once deduced from that belonging to 11=12-C2, by supposing the tangent cone to reduce itself to the pair of biplanes; 3 of the planes (a) of 11=12-C2 thus coming to coincide with the one biplane, and three of them with the other biplane. 61.

In the discussion of the equation it is convenient to write down the relations of the two surfaces, thus: Cubic surface. Reciprocal surface.

The equation puts in evidence the section by the plane w0, viz. this is the line 0 (reciprocal of the edge) three times, and the six lines (reciprocals of the rays) each once. Observe that the edge is not a line on the cubic; but its reciprocal is a line, and that an oscular line on the reciprocal surface; the six lines (reciprocals of the rays) are mere scrolar lines on the reciprocal surface; they pass, three of them, through the point x=y=z, and the other three through the point x: y: z=l: in: n; that is, they are six tangents of the point-pair (reciprocal of the pair of biplanes) formed by these two points. 71. 1 do not attempt to put in evidence the nodal curve on the surface; by what precedes it consists of 9 lines, reciprocals of the mere lines. If we denote by 1, 2, 3 and 4, 5 6 the lines which pass through the points x=0, y=O, z=0 and through the point xG #$=1 : qnm : n respectively, then these intersect in the nine points 14, 15, 16, 24, 25, 26, 34, 35, 36; and through each of these there passes a nodal line which may be represented by the same symbol; that is, we have the nodal lines 1 49 . 36. Two lines such as 14, 25 meet; and three lines such as 14, 25, 36 meet in a point; we have thus the six points 14. 25. 36 &c. triple points on the nodal curve; as before, h'= 9, t'=6. 72.

The equation of the Hessian surface is found to be (yZ + 8W)XZW+Y2(yZ tW)2 + 3(cX+ dY)XZW + 12rXY2(ctX+ by) (rZ+ W) ( 3aX3 + 9hbX2Y + 6c-XY2) 9X @{ (cw-2)X2+(ad-6c)XY +(hdc)Y2} OJ 272 PROFESSOR CAYLEY ON CUBIC SURFACES.' 79. Combining with the foregoing the equation of the surface XZW+Y2(rZ+8W)+(a, b, c, d,(X, Y) 3-0, it appears that these have along the line X=O, Y=O the common tangent plane X=0, or, what is the same thing, that they meet in the line X=A 0 Y=0 (the axis) twice, and in a residual curve of the tenth order, which is the spinode curve; the equations may be presented in the somewhat more simple form XZW+Y2(rZt+W)+(a, b, c, djX, Y))=0, -44y;Y2ZW-4(yZ+AW)(a, b, c, dXX, Y)3+12yrXY2(cX+6Y) +Xz 4(-1 2ac+ 9b2) 3d(4aX3Y + 6 bX2Y2 + 4cXY'+ dY4) O0 which, however, still contain the line X=-0, Y= twice. The spinode curve, as just mentioned, is of the tenth order; that is, we have t -10. Each of the 6 mere lines is a double tangent to the spinode curve, but the transversal is only a single tangent: to show this, observe that the equations of the transversal are X=0, yZ+7W+dY=0; substituting in the equations of the curve the first equation, that of the cubic surface is of course satisfied identically; for the second equation, writing X0, this becomes Y2{ 4rZW 4dY(yZ +-IW)3d2Y2} 0; or writing herein dY ((yZ +?W), it becomes Y2(yZ _ bW))2= 0. The value Y2-0 gives X=0, Y=0, yZ+W-0, viz, this is a point on the axis X0, Y=0 not belonging to the spinode curve; the value (yZ -W) 0 gives a point of contact X=0 Z + W? dY=O, yZW=0; and the transversal is thus a single tangent. Hence the number of contacts is 2.6+1, =13; that is, we have j'=13. Reciprocal Surface. 80. The equation is found by equating to zero the discriminant of the binary quartic {XX2+yXY(_ (Z w + 7)Y2} + 4Zw {X(a, b, c, dIX, Y>)3-7WT4}, or say this is (*(X, Y)4, where the coefficients are 6X2 + 24amZ, 3,DI +18bzw, 2 _2(kz+rY)X+122Czw 3(6z + yw)y + 6 dw, 6(tzyw)9. 81.

And similarly for the section by the plane Z-0. 8'. The nodal curve is made up of the lines which are the reciprocals of the six mere lines and the transversal; viz, we have three pairs of lines and a seventh line, the lines of each pair intersecting at a point of the seventh line, and these three points being the triple points of the nodal curve; t'= 3 as before. 84.

The four mere lines vand the transversal are each facultative; the edge is also facultative, counting toc cc; g'=-1= 7, t'= 3. That the edge is as stated a facultative line counting twice, I discovered, and accept, , _osteriori, from the circumstance that on the reciprocal surface the reciprocal of the edge is (as will be shown) a tacnodal line, that is, a double line with coincident tangent planes, counting twice as a nodal line. Reverting to the cubic surface, I notice that the section by an arbitrary plane through the edge consists of the edge and of a conic touching the edge at the biplanar point; by what precedes it appears that the arbitrary plane is to be considered, and that twice, as a node-couple plane of the surface: I do not attempt to further explain this. 89.

Each of the facultative lines is a double tangent to the curve, or we have 3'=6. Beciprocal Sturface. 100. Comparing the equation of the cubic surface with that for IVh=12-2C2, it appears that the equation of VI = 12-B3 C2 is obtained by substituting in that equation the values b=O, y=l. But instead of making this substitution in the final formula, it is convenient to make it in the binary quartic (*XX, Y)4, thus in fact working out the reciprocal surface by means of the function (XX2+yXY-wY2)2+4zwX(a, b, c, dXX, Y)3, the coefficients whereof (multiplying by 6 to avoid fractions) are 6x2 +24azw, &cy +186zw, y 2xw + 12czw, -3yw + 6dzw, 6wv2.

Write A= 4x+12cz, B 6cx3byy+6bdz-2ctw, C = 61dx--4ady -4ad2z+ 3(3b -4ac)w, and therefore L = Y2 + Aqv, M-=2dxy+ 2Bw, N -4d2X2 -4Cw, then we have P= { (y2 +Aw)(4d -x' +4Cw) +(2lxy -H 2Bw)'} _ 4 2{Cf2Bdxy +1 Ad2X2 +w(AC-B2) }, or the equation is 4L {Cy2-2Bdxy+Ad +w(AC-B 2) } + 1 8zLMN + I 6zM'+ 2 7Z2wN' = 0. 101. Consider the section by the plane w=O, wye have L=y2, M =2dxy, N= 4d2X2, and the equation becomes 4y4( y'-2Bdxy+Ad'x')+(128-144=)-16d'xry'z-0 which substituting for A, B, C the values A=4x+12ez, B = 6 ex3by G6dz, C =6bdx-4ady+4ad z, becomes 1 6ldy(y-dz)(dx33cX2y +3csy2 _ay3)=0; which is in fact the line w =O, yO (reciprocal of the edge) three times, and the lines w=O, (y-dz)(d, -c, b, -aorx,y)3=0 (reciprocals of the biplanar rays) each once. Observe that the edge (X= ,Z=O) is not a line of the cubic surface, but the reciprocal line y 0, w presents itself as an oscular line of the reciprocal surface. 102. The equations of the cuspidal curve are in the first instance obtained in the form L, MI, 3N =0. l12zw, L, -4M Consider the two equations L2 -lzwM=-0 LM+ 9zwN =0, each of the fourth order, but which are satisfied by zw= 0, L= O; that is, by (W 0, y2= 0), (z=0, y'+ 4xw 0). The line (w=,O. y=O) however presents itself in the intersection of the two surfaces, not twice only, but 4 times. To show this, observe that the line in question is a nodal line on the surface L'2 zwMO0; in fact attending only to the terms of the second order in y, w, we find { (4x+12cz)2 144cxz-144bdZ2}W2 24dxzywS=0, PROFESSOR CAYLEY ON CUBIC SURFACES. 283 giving the two sheets {(4x+lc1z)2 144cxz-144bdz2}w -24dxzy=O and wz0; in regard to the last-mentioned sheet the form in the vicinity thereof is given by w =Ay3 viz. we have approximately L=yf, M=2dxy, and thence y4-12z.Ay3.2dxy=0, that is, A-1 or w= 3y3; the line is thus a flecnodal line on the surface L2-12zwM=0. 2~4~dxz~ r' 24dxz Next as regards the surface LM+ 9zwN=0; the line y=0, wv=0 is a simple line on the surface, the terms of the lowest order being 9zw( -4d2x2)= 0; that is, we have w= 0, and for a next approximation w=Ay3, viz. L-y2, M= -2dxy, N=--4d2 2, and therefore -2dxy3+9z.Ay3(-4d2 )=O, that is, A= -or W = l~dy3; there is thus a three-2dxy3+9z.A~y3(-4dx2)=0,thatis, A8dxz'i8W fold intersection with one sheet and a simple intersection with the other sheet of the surface L2_ 12zwM=O. The surfaces intersect, as has been mentioned in the conic z==O Y2+4xw=O; or we have the line y=0, w=0 four times, the conic once, and a residual cuspidal curve of the order 4 . 4-4-2, =10; that is, c'=10.

The complete intersection with the surface is thus given by the equations WXZ+Y2Z +YX2-Z3=: 0 _4X2YZ +X4 + 4Z4 -0 which is made up of the line X=0, Z=0 (the edge) four times and a curve of the eighth order. To see this, observe that the last-mentioned surfaces have in common the line X=OZ=0, which is on the first surface a torsal line (equation in vicinity being Z -4 X2), and on the second surface a triple line (equations in vicinity being Z= _ X2 and X2= Z3). But Z= _yX2 touches Z=yX2) and the line counts thus (2+2=) 4 times. 107. 1 say that the complete intersection is the line (X=0, Z=O) three times together with a spinode curve made up of this same line once and of the curve of the eighth order; and that thus -'=9. The discussion of the reciprocal surface in fact shows that the reciprocal of the edge is a singular line thereof, counting once as a nodal and twice as a cuspidal line thereof; the cuspidal tangent planes are the reciprocals of the several points of the edge, and the edge is thus part of the spinode curve. The reasoning may appear to show that the edge should be counted twice, but it must be counted once only, making the order =9 as mentioned. 108. I find that the octic component of the spinode curve is a unicursal curve, the equations of which may be written X: Y: Z: W-1602: 4O+16O5: 16O3:-5 8O 16Os; the values of 0 at the binode B, are =0, = o , and we thus obtain in the neighbourhood thereof the two branches T (Z)2 X~t(~) and (iZ), X -T (Z)2 W =5W =E ndW=VY' T-as PROFESSOR CAYLEY ON CUBIC SURFACES. 285 109. Each of the lines (X-W=0, Y+Z=O) and (X-+W=0, Y-Z=O) is a double tangent of the spinode octic; in fact for the first of these lines we have 1608+8d4+1602+5=0, 160'+1603+4=-0 that is, (202 +1)2(4d4_4d2+5)=0, 40(2d2+1)2 =0 so that the line touches at the two points given by 202+1= 0; and similarly the other line touches at the two points given by 202_1 = 0. The edge X=0, Z= 0 has apparently a higher contact with the spinode octic, viz. the equations X= 0, Z 0 are satisfied by 0= 0 twice, 0o five times; but it must be reckoned only as a double tangent. Hence P'= 2. 2 +2, =6. Reciprocal Surface. 110. The equation is obtained by equating to zero the discriminant of the binary quartic X2(yZ -wX)2 + 4wZ2(wZ2 + ZZX+ XX2), viz. calling this (*30X, Z)4, the coefficients (multiplying by 6) are (6w2, -3ywv, y2+4xw, 6zw, 24w2); and then writing L = y2+4xw, M -= 2yz4w2, N = 4z2+16xw, we have = 2_ 12W2M, -J=L3-18W2LM-54W4N, and the equation is, as in former cases, L2(LN+M2)18mw2LMN-16w2M3 27 W4N2=0; but LN+M2 and therefore the whole equation divides by w, and we thus obtain 16L2( xz2+y2X+ w(yz + 4X2) +W3) 18LAMN 16wM3 27W3N2=0; or, completely developed, this is 7. 64 + W5.32 ( 3yz4x2) +W4. 16x( 5yf +9z2) +w3 ( y4+30zy22+160yzx227z4+64x4) + w2. 4x(lly3z + 12x2 9yz34z2x2) W~p .y2( y'z + 12y2X2 -yz3 8z2X2) 286 PROFESSOR CAYLEY ON CUBIC SURFACES. 111. To transform the equation so as to put in evidence the nodal curve, I collect the terms according to their degrees in (y, z) and (, w); viz. the equation thus becomes 64x4w'128x~"w'+64w7 +Z2 (-16 xW2 +144xw4) +zy( 160xlw'+ 96w' ) +i2( 48x'w2?+ g-80aw4) 4. -27w3 +z'y. -36xw2 + -z2y2. 8,.W + 30w' +-Z3. 44 XI +y . 12x2w+w' +Z'y3. _ W +Z2y4. -w + ZYf. 1V q~yG S =0. And if for a moment we write z=acsy, y=a-y and collect, ultimately replacing a, y by their values l-(z+y), -(z-y), the equation can be expressed in the form 643(.X2 2v)2 64w (_2w) + 8W2(z +y )2(_ +W )2(X 3w) + 8w2(Z _y)2(X _ )2(X_-3W -2w2(Z2 _y2) (2 _t2)X + _V (Z +y )4(X +V )2 w (Z +y )3(zy)(Xx+W)(3+7w7) + 1?W (Z2 _y2)2(11 2-27w2) W (Z +y) ((-Y)'(x-w)(3X-7W) + {w (z --y )4(Xw)2 y3( 2_,y2) (IV+ y)0 and observing that we have zw+y= -z(x-w)+x(z+y) --Z( qW) X(Z-) we see that every term of the equation is at least of the second order in z+y and x-wv conjointly; and also at least of the second order in z-y and x+w conjointly; that is, the surface has the nodal lines (z+y=O, x-w=0) and (z-y=0, x+w=0), which are the reciprocals of the lines 12' awl 13' respctively. The nodal curve is made up of PROFESSOR CAYLEY ON CUBIC SURFACES. 287 these two lines and of the line Y=O, w=0 (reciprocal of edge), as will presently appear; so that we have 1= 3. 112. The equations of the cuspidal curve are L2 12w2M 0, LM + 9W2N=05 4M2-+ 3LN = 0. Attending to the two equations L212w2M=y4 + 8y2xw+16Xu2w+ 24yzw2+ 48W4= 0, LM + 9w2N y3z + 2y2W2+ 4xyzw+ (8-72=)-64xw3+18z2w2=O0 these surfaces are each of the order 4, and the order of their intersection is 16. But the two surfaces contain in common the line (y= 0 w=O) 7 times; in fact on the first surface this is a cusp-nodal line 4xw+y2+Ay_=0; and on the second surface it is a nodal line w(4xy+I8zw)=0; the sheet w=O is more accurately 4xwiv+y2+By3. . .=0; whence in the intersection with the first surface the line counts 5 times in respect of the first sheet and 2 times in respect of the second sheet; together (5+2=)7 times, and the residual curve is of the order (16-7=) 9. 113. I say that the cuspidal curve is made up of this curve of the 9th order, and of the line y=O, w =0 (reciprocal of the edge) once; so that c'= 10. In fact, considering the line in question y=O, w=0 in relation to the surface, the equation of the surface (attending only to the lowest terms in y, w) may be written xz2(y2+ 4 2 + W( _y'z2) + W2( 3&rtyz') + &c.=0, giving in the vicinity of the line 4xw +f=---AY2, and then Z3 -Xz2A 2+_ ( 1__a36)=05 that is, A2 -2 -2 or 4xw+y2=V 2.Ayef; wherefore the line is a cusp-nodal line, counting once as a nodal and once as a cuspidal line; and so giving the foregoing results 19=3, '= 1O. 114. I revert to the equation which exhibits the :nodal lines (a-w=0, y+z-0), (x+w=,O y-z=O) for the purpose of showing that they have respectively no pinchpoints; that is, that in regard to each of them we have j='0 0. In fact for the first of these lines, neglecting the terms which contain x-w, y+z conjointly in an order above the second, the equation may be written 64w'(x+w)2 (X_@)2 + 8w2(X+w)2(X+3w)(z +y )2 + 82(z _y )2(X_ 3V)(X_-w)2 288 PROFESSOR CAYLEY ON CUBIC SURFACES. -32w2(z -y) (x+w)x (x-w)(z+y) + I (Z -y )2(11x2-27w2)(Z +y)2 w (z -y)'(3x 7w) (x-w)(Z+y) +IW (z y )4 (X W)2 +y3z (z y) (x-w)(z+Y) -y3X (Z y) (Z +y)2= 0, viz. this is (A, B, Cjxw, z+y)2=O, where, collecting the terms and reducing the values by means of the equations x-w=0, z+y=O, or say by writing x=w, -y=z, we have A= 64 W3(X+W)2 = 256w5 + 8tw2(Z y)2(X 3w) 64W3Z2 + 4 w2(z-_,)4 _+ 4wz4 4w(z2 _802)2 B=32(zy)(x+wv)xW2 -128w4z -w(Z-y)3(3X-_7w) + 32W2Z3 +yzz(z-y) 2z' = -2Z(Z28W2)2, C= 8wI2(X+W2)(X+3w) 128w5 + IW(z-y)2(llX2-27Tw2) 32wVz2 2 ~ ~ ~ ~ ? 2z i3(x y + 2,WZ4 X2y3(Z _y) + 2,WZ4 2w(Z2 -8W2)2. Hence the condition 4AC-B2-=0 of a pinch-point is (Z28w2)5= 0, sO that the pinchpoints (if any) would be at the points x-w0, y+z=0, z2-8w2=0; or say at x, y, z, w=1, -2V2, 2V2, 1. But these values give L, M, N=12, 12, -16; values which satisfy the equations L212w2M= 0, LM+ 9w2N= 0, 4M2 +3LN= O, and as the points in question are obviously not on the line y-=0, v= 0, they lie on the ninthic component of the cuspidal curve, being in fact points A', and not pinch-points. The line y=O, w =0 qua nodal line would have every point a pinch-point, but being part of the cuspidal curve, no point thereof is regarded as a pinch-point; that is, in regard to this line also we have j' 0. And therefore for the entire nodal curve = 0. 115. The cuspidal ninthic curve is a unicursal curve, the equations of which can be very readily obtained by considering it as the reciprocal of the spinode torse; we in fact have z : y : w V = ZAWAT + 2XY 2 YZ +rX2: WX+YI +2 :_f32 ZX, PROFESSOR CAYLEY ON CUBIC SURFACES. 289 or substituting for X, Y, Z, W their values (=1602, 4O+1665, 1603, -5-8D41608) and omitting a common factor 1602, we find for the cuspidal curve x: y:z: w-30+2405-1669: 2402+ 32a6: -4-48d': 160' (values which verify the equation Xx+Yy+Zz+Ww_=O); the spinode curve being thus of the order=9 as mentioned. For -c we have the singular point (y= 0, z0, w=0), (reciprocal of torsal biplane), and in the vicinity thereof x: y: z: w=1: 29-: 30-': -06, therefore (_) 4w (Y)=3 2 7z) For 0=0 wve have the singular point x=0, y=O, w=O (reciprocal of the other biplane), and in the vicinity thereof x: y: z: w= -_:d -602: 1:-4d3, therefore Y8 (:)2 w_ 25671 .116. The section of the surface by the plane z= O is an interesting curve. Writing z= 0 in the equation of the surface, I find that the resulting equation may be written (64w3, 144xw2, W3 + 76x2w +Xy2jw2+27x2, y2 _ 32 X)2=0 where observe that 64w3 (w3+ 76X2w +Xy2) -(72 w2)2 -=64w3w(w2 + 272) +. (y2z 32 w)]; so that the curve has the four cusps W2+272=0, y2_ 32xw=0; the plane z=O intersects the cuspidal ninthic curve in the point &= 0, z= 0, w=0) counting 5 times, and in the last-mentioned four points: in fact, writing in the equations of the ninthic z=0, that is 1+120S=O, we find x, y, w-80, ff02, 1603, and thence W2+27x2= 6._{2(1+1204)=0, y2-32xw=0. The curve has also nodes at the points (y=O, x+w=0; y=O, x-w=0), viz, these are the intersections of the plane z-0 with the nodal lines (y-z=O, x+w=0) and (y+z=0, x -w 0), and it has at the point (yr O, W=O) (intersection of its plane with the cusp-nodal line y=O, w-0, -and quintic intersection with the cuspidal ninthic) a singular point-2 cusps+7 nodes; hence the curve has cusps =(4+2=)6; nodes (2+7=)9; or 2 nodes+3 cusps=36; class =6, as it should be.

The complete intersection with the cubic surface is made up of the lines (Y0, X= 0), (Y=O, Z70), (Y=0, W=O) (the axes) each twice, and of a sextic curve which is the spinode curve; a'=6. The spinode curve is a complete intersection 2x3; the equations may in fact be written Y3+Y2 (XZ+ZW)+4aXZWrzO, 3Y2 +4Y(X+Z+W)+4(XZ+XW+ZW) -O; the nodes D, C, A are nodes (double points) of the curve, the tangents at each node being, the nodal rays. Each of the transversals is a single tangent of the spinode curve; in fact for the transversal Y+Z+X=O, W-0, these equations of course satisfy the equation of the cubic surface; and substituting in the equation of the Hessian, we have Y2(XZ)2'-0. But Y+Z+-X 0, W -O, Y-O is a point on the axis W-0, Y-0, not belonging to the spinode curve; we have only the point of contact Y+X+Z-0 W=0, X-ZO. Hence '-3. ]Reciprocal Srfjace. 122.

The nodal curve is made up of the lines (y=xz), (y-x=w), (y=z=-w), reci procals of the three transversals. To show this I remark that, writing P =(X-Y)+(z-zY)+((-Iy), (X -Y)(z -y) + (X -y)( -y) + (z -Y)(w -Y), =( -Y.)(Zy)(W -y), the equation of the surface may be written 4 &y (y) (y :) (y w) + a {y2( l2Wj2) +4 l 8y/tW + 2T7h'} + 2a{y(-6I3!2t'+ 9f31rt2 + 9r6'1')+ 2/' + 27T2_ 9f3y7%I (t _Z)2(X_W)'2(ZiW)2 = ? whence observing that r' is of the order 1 and Y' of the order 2 in (x-y), (z-y) conjointly, each term of the equation is at least of the second order in (x-y), (z-y) conjointly; or we have yv==z, a nodal line; and similarly the other two lines are nodal lines. 124. The foregoing transformed equation is most readily obtained by reverting to the cubic in T, U, viz. writing P=x-y, r=z-y, s=w-y, and therefore x= y+p, z=y+r, w-y's, the cubic function (putting therein T=V++yU) becomes a(V+yU)V2+(V-pU)(V-rU)(V-sU); writing 3', r' b'=p+r+s, pr +ps +rs, prs, the coefficients are (3(a+ 1), ay-j3', !,R), and the equation of the surface is thus obtained in the form 27(a + 1)2;12 + 18(a+ 1)(ay-3')ryW + 4(ct+l)ry -4(cty-plJ)3 (ay_ PI)2/ 2= 0, which, arranging in powers of a, and reversing the sign, is the foregoing transformed result. 125.

The equation is X{ZW(cX+ dY)-3X(ac-b2, ad-be, bd-c21jX, Y)2} =0, so that the Hessian breaks up into the plane X=0 (axial or common biplane) and into a cubic surface. The complete intersection of the Hessian with the cubic surface is made up of the line X=O, Y=O (the axis) four times; and of a system of four conics, which is the spinode curve; d =8. In fact combining the equations WXZ+(a, 6, c, d)X, Y)3=0 and ZW(cX+dY)3X(ac-6b2, ad-be, ldC2XXY)2=-O these intersect in the axis once, and in a curve of the eighth order which breaks up into four conics; for we can from the two equations deduce (a, lb, c, d(X, Y)'(cX+dY) + 3X2(acb2, ad-be, bd-c21X, Y)2=0, that is, (4ac3b2, ad, bd, ed, d2&X, Y)4 -0 a system of four planes each intersecting the cubic XZW +(a, b, G. dXX, Y)3 0 in thie axis and a conic; whence, as above, spinode curve is four conics, It is easy to see that the tangent planes along any conic on the surface pass through a point, and form therefore a quadric cone; hence in particular the spinode torse is made up of the quadric cones which touch the surface along the four conics respectively.

The section by the plane w-0 (reciprocal of B3=D) is the line w=0, y=O (reciprocal of edge) three times, and the lines w 0, dS33cX2y+3bxy2ay3=0 (reciprocals of the biplanar rays). And similarly for the section by the plane z=O (reciprocal of B3=C). The section by the plane y =O is made up of the lines (y= O, z=0), (y O, w= 0) each once, and of two conics, y=O, 16 (a2d26abed+4ac3+4b3d3b2c2)z2W2 + 8(ad23bcd+2e3)X2ZW + d2X4= 0. 131.

The equations may be written 3e2 +l12czw, 2gy+12bzw, y2-+[l2czw |-0. 2xy y+12bzw, yf+12czw, 12dzw Forming the equations (bd-c2) .l44z2w2+2(dy c 2f).ziv (ad-be) . 144z2-2 +(3dx2 2exy-by2). 12zw-2xy'3O, these are two quartic surfaces having in common the lines (&y-0, w-0), (yO0, z=0): attending to the line (y=O, z-0), this is on the second surface, an oscular line, Z-1-dxwIY3 on the first surface it is a nodal line, the one tangent plane being 6(bd-.c2)w.z+d.z.y 0, the other tangent plane being z=0, but the line being in regard to this sheet an oscular line, Z = 24dxwf Hence in the intersection of the two surfaces the line counts (1+ 3=)4 times; similarly the line y =O w -=O counts (1-+ 3 -)4 times; and there is a residual intersection of the order (16-4-4_)8, which is the cuspidal curve; c'-8. 133. The cuspidal curve is a system of 4 conics; in fact from the preceding equations written in the forms (bdC2, 2(dxyey2), -y4 12zw, 1)2 0, (adb,, 3da9 2 _ ybf, 2xy-3 12zw, 1)2 0, PROFESSOR CAYLEY ON CUBIC SURFACES. 297 eliminating zw, we obtain 3(bd C2)5 1) 2(-ad23bed+ 4c3), I 6(acd +2d-2bC2), & y)4=O 6(bc-ad)b, a c2d-b3, which shows that the cuspidal curve lies in 4 planes, and it hence consists of four conics; these are of course the reciprocals of the quadric cones which touch the cubic surface along the four conics which make up the spinode curve. 134. The equation of the surface, attending only to the terms of the second order in y, z, w, is 27d2x4zw 0; it thus appears that the point y O z 0, w O (reciprocal of the plane XWO) (which is oscular along the axis joining the two binodes, or BB-axis) is a binode on the reciprocal surface, the biplanes being z 0, tv-0, viz. these are the planes reciprocal to the binodes (X 0 -O Y0-O. W-0) and (X-0, Y==O, Z-O) of the cubic surface; we have thus B'=1. It is proper to remark that the binode yO0, z 0, wv =0 is not on the cuspidal curve, .as its being so would probably imply a higher singularity. 135. A simple case, presenting the same singularities as the general one, is when a d, b -c-0: to diminish the numerical coefficients assume a=d -IL2, the cubic surface is thus 12XZW+X3+Y3= O and the equation of the reciprocal surface, multiplying it by 4, becomes 3W3 + 6x2z2:w2 + (9x4 12x73i)zw 4y3(X3-y') = ,) viz. this is the surface 4y6 4y3x(X2 + 3z) +ZW(3X2+Zw)2=0 considered in the Memoir "On the Theory of Reciprocal Surfaces." The cuspidal curve is, as there shown, composed of the four conies y=O, 3X2+zw 0 and y32X3_0, a2 _iv=O; and it is there shown that the two points (x=0, ,y=0, z=0), (X=0, yO, w=O), each reckoned 8 times, are to be considered as off-points of the reciprocal surface. 136. The like investigation applies to the general surface, and we have thus O' 16; the points in question are still the points ( =O, y-O, z-0), (x=0, y-0, w=0); viz. these are the points of intersection of the surface by the line ( =0, y --0), which points are also the common points of intersection of the four conics which compose the cuspidal curve, that is, they are quadruple points on the cuspidal curve; it does not appear MDUC'CCLXIX. 2 s 298 PROFESSOR CAYLEY ON CUBIC SURFACES. that the points are on this account, viz. qu&a quadruple points of the cuspidal curve, offpoints of the surface, nor does this even show that the points should be reckoned each 8 times. As already remarked, the singularity requires a more complete investigation. Section X-12-B4-C2. Equation WXZ+(X+Z)(Y2-X2)zO. Article Nos. 137 to 143. 137.

Hessian surface. The equation is X(X + Z)(ZW + 3X2 _XZ) +y2(X_ Z )2= 0. The complete intersection with the surface consists of the line (X= 0, Y= 0), the axis, 4 times; the line (X=0, Z-0), the edge, 2 times; and a sextic curve, which is the spinode curve; d=6. Writing the equations of the surface and the Hessian in the form X(ZW+y2) _-X3 + Z(Y2_X2) =0 X(X+Z)(ZW+Y2)+(Z-3X){-_3 +Z(y2-X2)} =0 we see that the equations of the spinode curve may be written -X3+Z(y2_X2)='0 viz. the curve is a complete intersection, 2 X 3. There is at B4 a triple point -= (f) -=and at 2 a double point, the tangents coinciding with the nodal rays W-0, Y2-X2= 0. The edge and the mere line are each of them single tangents of the spinode curve. But the edge counting twice in the nodal curve, its contact with the spinode curve will also count twice, that is, we have P'-2.1 +1, =3. lReciprocal Surface. 141.

The section by the plane z= 0 is found to be (f 4)(y24a -H 44W2)2=0, viz, this 2 s2 300 PROFESSOR CAYLEY ON CUBIC SURFACES. is the two lines z =0, y2_-2=0 (reciprocals of the nodal rays), and the conic z=0, y2 + 4xw ? 4w2= 0 (reciprocal of the nodal cone WX +Y2-X2= 0) twice. 142. Nodal curve. The equation shows that the line y=O, x-z=0 (reciprocal of the line W 0, X+Z=0) is a nodal line on the surface. It also shows that the line y=0, w-O (reciprocal of the edge) is a tacnodal line (=2 nodal lines) on the surface; in fact attending only to the lowest terms in s, w, we have x2[1 6 (.v -Z)2,W2 + 8 (X + z)Vy2 +yj] -O. that is, Vz2 y2 4(-zw $_ 2y=0 two values, wv=Ay2, w By2, which indicates a tacnodal line.

The equations of the sextic are in fact XZ?Y2=0, X34-Z3=0, so that this consists of three conics, each in a plane passing through the edge.

The nodal curve is the line y=O, w=O0 (reciprocal of edge counting as 3 lines); b'= 3. In fact the form of the surface in the vicinity is given by w = 4 _ 4112? viz. there are two sheets osculating along the line in question, that is intersecting in this line taken 3 times. 149. For the cuspidal curve we have 12W2, 4zw, y2+4xw =0, i 4zw, y12+4Ww, -12w2 giving l2w+3y2 -4Z2=0, 36 w3 + 4wz +y2z 0; or multiplying the first by 3z and subtracting the second, we have 108w3+4z3=0. Hence the equations are z3+27'3=09 l2xw + 3y'_ 4Z2 = 0, viz. the cuspidal curve is made up of three conics lying in planes through the line z=0, w=O.

The complete intersection with the surface is made up of the line Y= 0 X0 (CB-axis) 3 times; the line Y-0, Z=O (CB-axis) 3 times; line Y-0, W-0 (CC-axis) twice, and of a residual quartic, which is the spinode curve; a' 4. 161.

The spinode curve is thus a complete intersection, 2 X 2; and since the first surface is a PROFESSOR CAYLEY ON CUBIC SURFACES. 307 cone having its vertex on the second surface, we see moreover that the spinode curve is a nodal quadriquadric. Instead of the last equation we may write more simply 4Y(X + Z)-+ 16XZ + 3W(3Y+ 4X+ 4Z) 0. The equations of the transversal are W-0, X+Y+Z-0, and substituting in the equations of the spinode curve we obtain from each equation (XX_Z)2-0, that is, the transversal is a single tangent of the spinode curve; (3' 1.

Article No. 202. 202. I annex the following synopsis, for the several cases, of the facultative lines (or node-couple curve) and of the spinode curve of the cubic surface; also of the nodal curve and the cuspidal curve of the reciprocal surface. It is to be observed that inl designating a curve, for instance, as 18 4 X 5 -2, this means that it is a curve of the order 18, the partial intersection of a quartic surface and a quintic surface, but without any explanation of the nature of the common curve 2 which causes the reduction, viz. without explaining whether this is a conic or a pair of lines, and so in other cases; this may be seen by reference to the proper section of the Memoir.

As this is a scroll there is here no question of the 27 lines and 45 planes; there is a nodal line X=0, Y -0, (b61) and a single directrix line, Z=0, W = 0. The Hessian surface is X2Y2-0; the complete intersection with the cubic surface is made up of X=0, Y=0 (the nodal line) 8 times, and of the lines X=0, Z=0, and Y-0 W-0 each twice. The reciprocal surface is x2z-y2w=0; viz. this is a like scroll, XXII-S(.i, 1); c'd0, b'=1. Section XXIH=S(1, 1). Equation X(XW+YZ)+Y3=0. Article No. 204. 204. This is also a scroll; there is a nodal line X-0, Y-0, and a single directrix line united therewith. The H essian surface is X4= 0; the complete intersection with. the cubic surface is X-0= Y-0 (the nodal line) 12 times. The reciprocal surface is w(xv+,yz)-z30; viz. this is a like scroll, XXIII=S(1, 1); c' O, b'1 1. Annex containing Additional Researches in regard to the case XX=12-U,8; equation WX2 +XZ2 + Y3=0.

CX2 + X(cZ)2 + cY3 0, and substituting for /W, cZ their values in terms of NX, Y, we have (X +f Y)cX2 + X(aX + 1yY)2 + c2Y3 = 0 that is (a2 _cg, 2a6+cf, 1 b, c21X, Y)3 '=0 or say 3(a2cg)) 2ab+cf, b2, 3c2 )X, Y)3=0, viz. the condition of contact is obtained by equating to zero the discriminant of the cubic function. We have thus 27c4(a2_ cg)2 + 4b6(a2-cg) + 4C2(2ab + of)' Z14(2a6+cf)' -l-818bc'(a'-cg)(2a13-icf)=0, PROFESSOR CAYLEY ON CUBIC SURFACES. 323 viz. this is + 27a4c2 4a'3b + 30a2b2cf 54a2ceg + 36ab3cg + 24abc2f2 + 4b65h lbf2 +18b262fq + 27c4g2 +4c~f3=0, which is the condition in order that the line (a, b, c, f, g, h) may touch the surface X2W+XZ2+Y3=0; and if we unite thereto the conditions that the line shall pass through a given point (oc, (3, r, b), we have in effect the equation of the circumscribed cone, vertex (oc, ,3 y), Writing (f g, h, a, b, c) in place of (a, 6, c, f g, h), we obtain 27 4h2 +30 fg2ha -54 ph3b + 36 fg3hb + 24 fgh2a2 + 4glc 1 g4a2 +18 g2h2ab +27 h4Y2 + 4h3a3=0 as the condition that the line (a, b, c, f, g, h) shall touch the reciprocal surface 27(4xw +Z2)2+ 64y3w=O; ana if we consider a, b, c, f, g, h as standing for 7yy-P &3z--X &s S 8-asy, S4 aw, 6#-Ptv, 6z-'Yu> values which satisfy the relation ( 0, h, -, a a (3, y ,) 09 -h, 0, f; b g, -f, 0, a -a, -6b, -c, 0 2xE2 324 PROFESSOR CAYLEY ON CUBIC SUJRFACES. then the equation in (a, b, c, f; g, h) is that of the circumscribed cone, vertex (z, , y' the order being (as it should be) a'=6. The cuspidal conic is y=O, 4xw+z2=O, and we at once obtain a2-4cg-Q as the condition that the line (a, b, c, f g, h) shall pass through the cuspidal cone. Hence attributing to (a, b, c, f, h) the foregoing values, we have a2-4cg=O for the eqution of the cone, vertex (ca, 3, y, 8), which passes through the cuspidal conic; this is of course a quadric cone, c'=;2. I proceed to determine the intersections of the two cones. Representing by 0=0 the foregoing equation of the circumscribed cone, and putting for shortness X= 27h2(.bh) 2g2(2fg + ah), I find that we have identically 0 (f2 bh)X + (g4 4ahMSfgh)(a24cg) -(32fg2h + 16agh2)(af + bg +ch):z:0o whence in virtue of the relation af+bg+ch=0, we see that the equations 0=-0, a2-4cgq=0, are equivalent to (fbh)X O , a2 -4cg 0, or the twelve lines of intersection break up into the two systems f 2 _bh 0, a2-4cg0, and (X-) 2 7h2( f M2Ih)-2g2(2fg + ah) = 0, a2-4cg=0. To determine the lines in question, observe that we have ( 0, h, g a j(e, (3 r, -hi 0, f, b g, -.f 0, c -a, -4, -G and we can by the first three of these express a, 4, G linearly in terms of f, , It the equations f2 bh = 0, a2 4cg=0, 27h2(f2 bh)-22g(2fg+ah)= 0 become thus homogeneous equations in (J; g, h); the equations may in fact be written 2(a 4cg) = (72+ 4zb)g2 + -2h22f3 ygh 4P3hf= 0, (f2-bh) =3f 2_ ah2 + fhf=-? X =27hI2(8f2 _ at2+ yhf) + 2g2(p3h2 yght2 fg) -0, viz. interpreting (f g, th) as coordinates in _lano, the first equation represents a conic, the second a pair of lines, and the third a quartic. We have identically { 2j3f(y2+ 4a6)g +rh }2 4p21f2 4zst2 + rkf) =(ya+ 4o~) { (y2 + 40s)g2 -H132It2 2f2rgh 4fpthf };) PROFESSOR CAYLEY ON CUBIC SURFACES. 325 and it thus appears that the two conics touch at the points given by the equations a h2 + yhf0 20bf3f(r2+ 44a)g;Gy+Prh=0: we have moreover (72 + 4a;)(ph2ygh-2ifg)=4j(3f2 oh2 + rhf) + (28frh)[213tf(r + 4A)g + Pyh], hence at the last-mentioned two points -fh2+ ygh+2ifg is -0; and the quartic X=O thus passes through these two points. The conic (a2-cg)= 0 and the quartic X=O intersect besides (as is evident) in the point gz=0, h=O reckoning as two points, since it is a node of the quartic; and they must consequently intersect in four more points: to obtain these in the most simpnle manner, write for a moment 2 _ (y2 + 4 M)g2 + j32h2, then we have identically 16_2g'(bf a-csh2 + yhf) -22= [(y2 + 4_Z)g2 + 32h2] + 432g2(7h+2 2f)2 { (r2 + 4b)g2f+2h22p3ygh4pffg} { (r2 + 4ac)g2 +(h2 + 23ygh + 4p3fg} _ -(a2 4cg) { (y2+ 4:cd)g2+f2h2 + 2fygh + 4pfg } ; and moreover 23p(h22 fgygh) -Q= (y2 + 48)g2 + 32h2-2 P2ygh 4 Pfg(a2 4cg). Hence when a2-4cg=0, we have f2 _h2+yhf_ 292, Ph2-2Mfg-#Ygh-= and substituting these values in the equation X=0, it becomes 27h2. 16p2a 2g2 = 0 viz. multiplying by 16P2 , and omitting the factor 2, this is 27h2l + 16 3Pg4=0, or finally 1G6Pfg4-27(r2+ 4c2)g2h2+ 27 32h4 =0, a pencil of four lines, each passing through the point g=O, h-0, and therefore intersecting the conic (r2 + 4cM)g2+j32h22f3?yqh4j3zhfzz 0 at that point and at one other point; and we have thus four points of intersection, which are the required four points. Recapitulating, the conic a2-4cg=0 meets the sextic (f2-bh)X=O in the two points 2_f2 -hh2+ yhfo0 t2okf-_ (r2+ 4Acd)g +r f3-7h 0 326 PROFESSOR CAYLEY ON CUBIC SURFACES. each three times, in the point grO0, h=O0 twice, and in the four points J16pgq427(y2 + 4ca)g2h2 + 27j32h40 I(y2 +a4)g2 +2.2fygh-4f3hf 0 each once. Or reverting to the proper significations of (a, b, c, A; g, h), instead of points, we have 2 lines each three times, a line twice, and 4 lines each once; the line g-0, h=0, that is, g=0, h=0, a==0, being, it will be observed, the line y drawn from (a pi 7r y) to the point y=0, z-0, wL 0, which is the reciprocal of the uniplane X=0: the twelve lines are the ae' lines of intersection of the circumscribed cone a' with the cuspidal cone ct, viz. a'd= [a'd] + 3o+X [tde']-4 referring to the last-mentioned four lines; t?-2 to the two lines; and )e-2 to the line qg=0, h--0, a=O, which it thus appears must in the present case be reckoned twice.
