[46] III. The Lunar Eclipse, Oct. 11, 1772, observed at Canton. Communicated by John Blake, Esq. of ParliamentStreet. Redde, Nov. 4, 1772. To J O H N B L A K E, Esq. of Parliament-Street, Westminster. MY DEAR FATHER, WITHIN an hour after I closed my letter to you, by this ship, enclosing Astronomical Observations from Pekin, I received the enclosed observation, of the late Eclipse, made by a Jesuit here. An accident prevented their sealing the packet for a few hours; and Mr. Hume is now waiting only for this letter of mine to finally dispatch. Canton, Dec. 12, 1772. per ship Osterley. J. B. BLAKE. I know nothing of the accuracy of the observation, as he is lately arrived here *. * And the time being taken only by a watch regulated by the sun the day before, the observation is not much to be depended on.
