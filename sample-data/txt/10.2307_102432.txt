(49) IV. An Account of the Burning of several HayRicks by a Fiery Exhalation or Damp: And of the Infectious Quality of the Grass of several Grounds. From the same Ingenious Person. S I R, I Received this last Post from my worthily esteemed Friend Mr. Maurice Jones, Rector of Dol-Gelheu; the following Account of the burning of several Ricks of Hay and Houses, and also the Poysoning of the Grass, so as to render it Mortal to the Cattle that feed upon it, by a kindled Exhalation, or Ignis Fatuus. Be pleased to take it in his own words: ` This Letter contains no Answer to your Queries a` about the Locusts, for I am wholly intent at present ` upon giving you the best Account I can of a most ` Dismal and Prodigious Accident at Hartech in this ` County the beginning of these Holy-days. It is of ` the unaccountable firing of Sixteen Ricks of Hay, and ` two Barns, whereof one was full of Corn, the other ` of Hay. I call it unaccountable, because 'tis evident ` they were not burnt by common Fire, but by a kind` led Exhalation, which was often seen to come from ` the Sea. Of the duration whereof I cannot at pre` sent give you any certain Account, but am satisfied it ` lasted at least a Fortnight or three Weeks; and annoy'd ` the Country as well by Poysoning their Grass as Firing ` the Hay, for the space of a Mile, or thereabouts. Such ` as have seen the Fire, say, 'twas a blew weak Flame, ` easily (50) ` easily extinguish'd, and that it did not the least harm ` to any of the Men who interposed their Endeavours ` to save the Hay, though they ventured (perceiving it ` different from common Fire) not only close to it, but ` sometimes into it. All the Damage sustained happen'd ` constantly in the Night. I have enclosed a Ctalogue ` of such as I have received certain Information of; ` and have nothing to add, but that there are three small ` Tenements in the same Neighbour-hood (called Tydhin ` Sion Wyn) whereof the Grass is so infected, that it ab` solutely kills all manner of Cattle that feed upon it. ` The Grais has been Infectious these three Years but ` not throughly Fatal till this last. Pray send me with ` all convenient speed your Friends Thoughts and your ` own, of the Causes, and if possible, also the Remedy ` of this Surprizing Phaenomenon, &c. Dol-Gelheu, Jan. 20th. 1693/4. Decemb. 24th. 1693. Richard Griffith of Lechwedh-du, Humphrey Owen of Garreg-wenn, and Richard ~ of Erw-wenn, each of these lost a Rick of Hay the 24th. at Night. Decemb. 27th. 1693. That Night was burnt one Rick of Hay of John Philips of<inferred>Tnys</inferred> Lanvihangel y Traethau, two Ricks of Hay of Grissith John Owen of Cefn Trevorbach, and Katherine William, Widdow, of Cefn-Trevorfvawr, lost two Ricks. Decemb. 29th. 1693. That Night Francis Evans of Glas-vryn had one Rick burnt. Richard Davydh of Erwwen, predict. had a Barn-full of Hay of three Bayles of Buildings burnt down to the Ground. V. Part
