L 7' 1 V. On a Class of Differential Equations, including those which occur in Dynamnical Problems.-Part I. By W. F. DONKIN, L.A., F.R.S., F.l.A.S., Sari/lan Pros fessor of Astronomy in the University of Oxford. Received February 23,-Read February 23, 1854. THE Analytical Theory of Dynamics, as it exists at present, is due mainly to the labours of LAGRANGE, POISSON, Sir W. R. HAMILTON, and JACOBI; whose researches on this subject present a series of discoveries hardly paralleled, for their elegance and importance, in any other branch of mathematics. The following investigations in the same department do not pretend to make any important step in advance; though I should not of course have presumed to lay them before the Society, if I had not hoped they might be found to possess some degree of novelty and interest*. Of previous publications with which I am acquainted, those most nearly on the same subject are, Sir W. R. HAMILTON'S two memoirs "On a General Method in Dynamics" in the Philosophical Transactions; JACOBI'S Memoir in the 17th vol. of CRELLE'S Journals " Ueber die Reduction der partiellen Differential-gleichungen," &c.; and M. BERTRAND'S " Me'toire sur l'integration des equations diff~rentielles de la M6canique," in LIOUVILLE'S Journal (1852). The relation in which the present essay stands to the papers just named will be apparent to those who are acquainted with them, and it would be useless to attempt to make it intelligible to others. Oxford, Feb. 21, 1854. SECTION I. 1. Let x1, X2, .... x,, be n variables, connected by n relations with n other variables ye y2, o2*. yn; so that each variable of either set may be considered as a function of the variables of the other set. Suppose then yi=7Pi(XI X2. Xn)) [* It may be useful to specify the parts to which I should principally refer as containing what is, relatively to my own reading on the subject, new; and in the present day it can hardly be required of any one to profess more than this kind of originality.

( 0 = dy,, dxl + Ly,, dx + + dyi dxn +e+aoeo?( dxj dy, d, dy, d~ n dyj where j is any index different from i. These theorems are given by JACOBI in his memoir "De Determinantibus functionalibus." They are however only particular cases of more general theorems, which may be investigated as follows. If we represent by Z, J, ki p, q, r, Oe. any two determinate sets of m indices each, selected out of the series 1, 2, 3,... n7 then the determinant formed with the m2 differential coefficients dyi dy*,; dyj dy1 & dxp' dVq'q possesses properties remarkably analogous to those of a simple differential coefficient. This analogy was pointed out by JACOBI, and has been further developed by M. BERTRAND in his "M noire sur le Determinant d'un systeme de Fonctions" (LiOUVILLE'S Jou rnal, 1851). It appears to me that such functional determinants might be appropriately and conveniently denoted by a symbol analogous to that of a common differential coeffi(ient; thus d(yi, Yj., Yk) ... and I shall adopt this notation in the present paper. For example, d(u, v) d(x., y) would represent the determinant du dv du dv dx dy dy dx [rThe expression (D.) is not a mere arbitrary symbol, but, like a simple differential coefficient, is a real fraction. For if we denote by d(xcp, xq, xj. ... the determinant formed with the m2 quantities d~lz, diXq, di.r... d2x', d2x,, d2Xr.,x* -dmnap, dmzqdm, tnse DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS OF DYNAMICS, ETC. 73 and attribute a corresponding meaning to d(,Yin , Yj k, *) where dI, d2, ... d. are symbols denoting n distinct and independent sets of variations, so that dryi= dx dx2 + +dX then it follows from well-known properties of determinants (as M. BERTRAND has shown) that the complete functional determinant formed with the n2 differential coefficients dyl dy1 dy2 dy2 & d~ij d2 dx dx,, is equal to the quotient of the two determinants which I propose to denote by d(yl, y2, 3, *.. yn), d(xl, X2, X3 ...Xn) and moreover that the partial functional determinant formed with the m2 terms dyi dyi dyj dyi _.., &c. p dq Wzp dXq is equal to the quotient of the two partial determinants d(yi, yj, yk, . ..), d(xp, Xq~ X~rN*) the differentials of yi, &c. being taken on the hypothesis that all the differentials of the x-variables are =0, except those of the set xP, xq, xr, eve Thus the expression (D.) is a real fraction, provided its numerator and denominator be interpreted in a manner exactly analogous to that in which the numerator and denominator of an ordinary total or partial differential coefficient are interpreted.] This being premised, let ul, u2, .... ur be m functions of any or all of the functions Y1i 52, ... yn (m being supposed not greater than n), so that UI, u2, &c. are functions of XI) x2, &c. through yi, ,2, &c.

Then the general theorem analogous to dudu + may be expressed as follows:' m 4{~~~d(ypl, Y92, ,Yak) (the summation on the second side referring only to the indices P, and extending to every combination of m out of the n numbers 1, 2, ... n). In like manner, the theorem analogous to dui dui dy+ dui dY2 dxj dy1 dx dY2 dj is d(u21, U22, ... Unm) = t fd(u21, Ua22 ... 8am) d(ys,, YP2, *?am)} Mi. L _ Al _ . 74 PROFESSOR DONKIN ON THE These two theorems (expressed in a different notation) may be found in the memoirs above cited. But the following, which we shall have occasion to employ hereafter, has not, so far as I am aware, been explicitly stated. Inasmuch as dyi 1= dyY=O it follows that the determinant represented by dyi 'dy7 d(ya,, Yoc2l ... Yarm) d(ypl, Yp2' Yay).. ( is =1 if (3' (2, ... PM be the same combination of indices as 2.. am, but is =0 in every other case. (For in the first case the determinant is formed with 1, 0, 0, ...; 0, 1, 0, ....; 0, 0, 1, ...; &c., but if there be one index Pi which is not contained in the series ol ,21 &c., then one row of terms in the determinant will consist wholly of zeros.) Now considering g 12, :&c. as functions of x,, x2, &c., and again considering these latter as functions of y1, Y2, &c. given by the inverse equations, we have, by the preceding theorem, for the value of the determinant (E.) above written, the expression Vm= fdiyal YX22 *@*Yxm) d(xll, X,2 .. Xm)l 7Yld(xyli, y2, *m) d(YP1, W, 2 Y9M) (where e,, c2. . Ma; PI (32^ ... P. are two determinate sets of m out of the n indices, and the summation with respect to the indices y extends to every combination of m out of the n). Consequently, VmI or= g-0,.. . . . (3.) according as the series of indices (l3, (321 (3m is, or is not, the same combination as (I suppose, for convenience, that when the two combinations are the same, the arrangement is the same in each; otherwise the value of Vm may be 1.) This is the theorem in question. If we put m= 1, we obtain the equations (1.) and (2.) given at the beginning of this article. If we put m=n, the expression Vn reduces itself to the product of the two determinants formed respectively with the complete sets of differential coefficients dYZ &c., dyi &c., the value of which product is = 1, as is well known. As an illustration , it may be useful to exhibit the theorem in the case of m=2, as expressed by the common notation. Namely, dY2 p dq dyp dyq\ / dx de dx dx l daV d=1 ~j \ /dyO xdyi dyi dyjf = 0 .

DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS OF DYNAMICS, ETC. 75 2. Theorem.-Retaining the suppositions made at the beginning of the last article, let X be a given function of xI, x2, .... xSn and let us further suppose that the equations by which yl, y2, ... yl are determined as functions of xj, &c., are dX dX dX dyt dyj~ so that ___" dx d and if we transform the equations (1.), (2.), art. 1, by this condition, we obtain the n equations dy1 dx1 +Ldy ?fq J+ y dLXn o dxl dy, dxl dyj d 0j dyi dyl dx,+Ly2 d$2 dy1 dyx dx Tyj+ d2 dyi + * Z y, dy, dxj dye LX2 Lyn dwn dxi ry, dxz dyz + ** x dyj 41 * * . * & o It 4 0 If these equations be added, after multiplying them respectively by dxl ~ X2 dsn dy1 dyj dyj dXj the sum of the first members reduces itself by virtue of the equations (1.), (2.), to whilst the second side consists of the single term hWe have then dyj dxi dx1 dyj-dy' or, in other words, f x1, x2 ...

The relation between X and Y is easily found as follows. The equations (5.) and (6.) give dX-yl dXl +y2dX2+ *.. +yndxV dY=x1dy1 + X2dy2+ ... + Xdyn; whence, by addition, d(X+Y)=d(xwyl+xWy2+ .+nyn) . and therefore X+Y=X-y1+X2y2+ -+-Xyn.* (7.)

It is easy to show a posteriori that the expression (8.) verifies the equations (6.), but I pass on to some further considerations. (See note at the end of Section II.) 3. Suppose the function X involves explicitly, besides the variables x1, x2, &c., any other quantity so that the expressions (x1), (xd), &c. (or the values of xj, x2, ..* in terms of y, Y21 &c*) will also involve p explicitly, and we shall have d(X) dX dX d(xl) dX d{(x,} d c p p dhdp dX d(x) d(X2) =dp +Yl dp Y A p+++ Now, differentiating the equation (8.) with respect to p (so far as it contains p explicitly), we obtain Ad d(X)+d(Zl) +Y2dp+ dpdp 'ledip r which the equation above written reduces simply to dX dy dp dp>(* In the particular case in which X is a homogeneous function of xj, x2, ..., Ace and of m dimensions with respect to those variables, the equations. (8.) and (9.) become Y= (mi) (X) dX d(X).=0(10.) J+ (M-1)-dp l and it is easily seen that Y is also homogeneous and of mdimensions in y,,y, ... 4. The theorems (8.) and (9.) are cases of more general ones which are easily proved in a perfectly similar way, and which I shall therefore only enunciate. If, by means of the equations (5.), art. 2, we express a set of n out of the 2n variables, consisting of r x's and n-r y's, of which no two indices are the same, for example, Xl X) X2 b .Yr+ .,.n *(a) in terms of the remaining n variables, Yl) Y2) .. -Yrl X~r~rln --Xn Z * * * * * ( then, taking Q (X) + (x1)y1+ (X2),y2+ .+ (Xt)Ys (in which the brackets indicate that the variables of the set (a.) are to be expressed in terms of those of the set (a.), so that Q is afunction of the latter set), we shall have dQ dy =X. from i=O to i=r dQ dQ = -Y from j=r+ I toj-n, DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS OF DYNAMICS, ETC. 77 dX dQ and d+d---O asbefore*; but the equations corresponding to (10.) will not subsist unless X be homogeneous with respect to the r variables x1, x2, ... xr 5. Let us now suppose Ithat the function X contains, explicitly, besides the n variables xl, x2, ... x., another variable t, and also n constants a,, q2, ... an; and that these last are contained in such a way that the n equations dX dX dX da 1 da2= a. (21 ) would be algebraically sufficient to determine al, a2, a. in terms of b, b2i &c. x, &c Then taking X (X) + (al)6l + (a2)b2+ .. + (an) b (the brackets indicating that a,, a2, &c. are to be expressed as above supposed), we shall have, by the theorems of arts. 2 and 3, dXb dXb dXb db =al, db2 =a2,... db-an; (12.) and also, for all values of i, dXb dXdx^=-dx =i,; * . . ... . . . . . . . (13.) to which we may add dXb dX dY (14.) dtdtdt d.(4. Now assuming the 2n equations (5.) and (11.), namely (for all values of i), dX dX dxctYt dai=bi we may suppose each of the 2n variables x1, x2, yl ... . to be expressed by means of them as a function of the 2n constants a,, &c., bl, &c., and t; oir, conversely, each of the 2n constants to be expressed as a function of the variables x1, &c., yi, &c., and t. On the former hypothesis each of the variables xi, ... yl, . is given as an explicit, and on the latter as an implicit function of the single variable t, which we will consider as independent; and total differentiation with respect to t will throughout this paper be denoted by accents, which will be used for no other purpose. Thus, p being any function of all the variables, we shall have dp dp dp, P=Tt+dxj+ . + 1 +.. For the rest, we may, when necessary, distinguish the meanings of the various partial * Although these theorems, as stated in the text, are more general in form than those of the preceding article, they may, under another point of view, be considered as particular cases of them, and may in this way be best established. 78 PROFESSOR DONKIN ON THE differential coefficients employed, by referring to the hypotheses on which they are taken, and which I shall denote as follows: Iyp. I.-The 2n variables xX2, ... as 1Y21 ... expressed as functions of a,, a, ... ba , b44 and t. Hyp. II.-The 2n constants a1, a., ... b,, b2, ... expressed as functions of x1, x, ... 91 Y2 '" and t. Hyp. III.-The n variables yen ye2 .4. y. expressed as functions of the n variables x,, x2, .. xAC, the n constants al, a2, ... are and t (as by equations (5.)). Hyp IV.-The n constants b6, b2, ...b expressed as functions of the n variables 17 ... Xg the n constants a,, ... a,, and t (as by equations (11.)). 6. Differentiating totally the equation (I 1.), dX d, with respect to t, we obtain (observing that by virtue of the conditions (5.)), d2X dy, I, dy2 I dy,, daidt+da l+dai daz twhere 4-l, &c. are taken on Iyp. IMI. art4 5. Now let (Z) be a function of xI, ... x, t, all .e a.,, defined by the equation (Z) dt n ? ? X . . e e (15.) the above equation then becomes daZ dal X d2 Jr d Ed d a-i"I+W-+ +TiX If this equation be multiplied by da and the result on each side summed with respect to i, it wvill be seen that the coefficients of x, x &c. on the second side all vanish except that of x5 which reduces itself to I (see art. 1, equations (1.) (2.)); so that we have d(Z) (Z) d( , d( an, dal Iy dyj d **1 day, dye 2 Now the expression on the left of this equation is equivalent to dZ dy1 if by Z (without brackets) we denote the result of substituting for a1, a., ... a. iln (Z), their values in terms of all the variables (Hyp. II.), so that Z is a function of the variables only. We have then, finally (writing i instead ofj), 1dZ d ya (16.) Again, we have (Iyp. III.) ydmYi+ +.e.

Hyp. III.). And since dy'jly , &c., comparing the two equations last written, we obtain dZ ,__dZ . . . .i. . (17.) Trhe system of 2n equations (16.) and (17.) express the result of eliminating the 2n constants from the equations (5.) and (11.) and their differential coefficients with respect to t. In other words, (16.) and (17.) are a system of 2n simultaneous differential equations of the first order, of which (5.) and (11.), or again, the equations supposed in Hyp. I. or IL., art. 5, are the 2n integrals. 7. There are other remarkable relations between the partial differential coefficients of the expressions supposed in Hyp. I. and II., art. 5. For if we differentiate the equation dX =bi with respect to as (Hyp. ', we obtain d2X d2X dX d2X dX2+ _ dadadaidxl daj daidx2 da1. * (a-) which gives, putting b6 for dX and yj for dX' dj+ LX_+2_+ + n=O .(b.) dai dai daj da, I d a ida da; (where d-i; refers to Ilyp. IV., g', &C to Hyp. Ill., andd d'l, &c. to Hyp.L). If then this equation be multiplied by da. (Hyp. II.) and the result summed with respect to i, the sum of the first terms is d i (Hyp. 11.), and for the rest, the coefficient of Lak reduces itself to unity, whilst those of the remaining terms vanish (art. 1, dai equ. (1.), t2.)). Thus we have dyk-da,.(18.) (where the first side refers to Hyp. II., and the second to Hyp. I.). Now if we treat the equations dY dY 7-=X?, -7 =h 80 PROFESSOR DONKIN ON THE (see equations (6.) and (9.), putting a, for p in the latter) exactly in the same way,: it is plain that the result may be deduced from (18.) by interchanging x and y, and changing the sign of b; thus dbj dyk dXk da1 Lastly, from the equations d-b =, d, dc _-yi (see (12.) and (13.)), we should find in a similar manner day =dwk. dyk d1J3 and from the analogous equations (the existence of which is obvious) dYb dYb dyi -xi, bi = -a we should obtain dYk d~k dbl Collecting these results, and changing the indices, we have the system dxi db dxidaj 1 day dy-i d b dyz I 9.) dyi dbh dyi __day day dxi d by dWXi in each of which equations the first member refers to HIp. I., and the second to Hyp. II. (art. 5.); and it is to be remembered that there is no relation between the. indices of the variables and those of the constants, so that the case of i=j has no peculiarity*. 8. Let I, A be symbols denoting two distinct sets of arbitrary and independent variations attributed to the 2n constants; then the equations dX dX give AX = f(,yj~j+ajb); and if the operation a be performed on each side, we have + j(,yjAtt+ajA\b)* It is remarkable that each of the equations (19.) is also true on a different and separate hypothesis, as is apparent on inspection of the four different sets of equations, dX dXb dY dYb -Yi, -Yiw --Xi, = _-=Xi dxi dxi dIW dYi dXb dXb dY. dY a -= bi, =at -=-i -= _j dai dbs dai db (see the preceding articles). DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS OF DYNAMICS, ETC. 81 If from this we subtract the corresponding equation obtained by inverting the order of the operations be , remembering that A?u=-iAu,-we obtain (4Ayj + t(8a~biasb) = 0 * . (20.), (The use here made of the double operation AW, is clue in principle to Mr. BOOLE. See his demonstration of a well-known theorem of LAGRANGE, of which the equation (20.) is a more general formt). If in this equation we suppose 4j, lyre &c. to be expressed in terms of fain the &e. (Hyp. I.), and Aajj ibis &c. in terms of An&) Ayil &c. (Hyp. II.), and compare the terms on the two sides, it is easy to derive the relations (19.). 1 preferred however to deduce them by a more direct method. 9. If xi be expressed in terms of the 2n constants and t (Iyp. 1.), and then each constant be expressed in terms of the variables (Hyp. It.), the result is an identical equation. Differentiating then with respect to xi5 x1, yk we obtain the three equations 1 d +?dal daedl+ t2+ d: db2 + &C dxi da dx dAl dx d+2 dx ? d & o~t al+-t bld{ dh db+& da dxi di lx I x en da-x A dex dx= da dxi db1 d I daxL dxi d+ &C. 0= +-j -+l 7xb '~ Lq+Ll ' + & a I dyk aol dYk da2 dYk db2 dyk Three similar equations may be obtained by treating y, in the same way. And if we apply to these six equations the transformations given by the system (19.), art. 7 the resulting theorems may be comprehended in the following statement. If p, q be any two of the 2n variables xw, ... o1, y5,... yn, then dp( dq d -q (dbi dai dbh dai= ki tddai das db ) dp dq dq dp =?1,or=0, . . (21.) according as p and q are or are not a conjugate pair, i. e. a pair of the form x;, y1. (The value +1 belongs to the case in which p=xj, q=,yj, and ito the converse.) Here p and q are a determinate pair of variables, and the summation refers to the constants extending to the n conjugate pairs. More important however are the converse theorems obtained in a perfectly similar way by expressing aj, or bi in terms of the variables (Hyp. II.) and supposing the variables to be again expressed in terms of the constants and t (IHgp. I.). Differentiating the resulting identical equation with respect to a,, a,, bi, bj, and applying the transformations (19.) as before, we have, putting h, k for a determinate pair of constants, Adh dk dh dk\, (de dxi dxi dyi\ P~dyz x~dxjcdye h dk dk dk} ?IorO .i = _ o (22.) * This might be written See the notation proposed in art. 1.t Cambridge Mathematical Journal, vol. ii. p. 100.MDCCCLIV. M 82 PROFESSOR DONKIN ON THE according as h, k are or are not a conjugate pair, i. e. of the form a,, b,. (The value +1 belongs to k= a>, k=bj, and -1 to the converse.) According to the notation proposed at the beginning of this paper, the above formula may be written 2id(h, k) = 2i d(yi x) I, or =0. ~d(yi, xi) dh~k By a usual and convenient abbreviation, the sum d(h, k) d(yi, xi) may be denoted by the symbol* [h, k]. We have then, by (22.), [as, bi] =-[be, ai] = 1 [ai, bu] = [ai, aj] = [bi, bj] =0 .(23.) j being different from i; and, obviously, [ai, ai] = [bi, big-? 0 Now letf, g be any two functions whatever of the 2n constants a,, &c. bl, &c.; when the latter are expressed in. terms of the variables (ilyp. II.),f, g become also functions of the variables; and if h, k represent, as above, any pair whatever of al, &c., b1, &c., we have (see art. 1.) d(f, g) __ fd(f, g) d(Jh, k) d(y*. xi) td-(kk) df(yi, xi)| the summation referring to h, k, and extending to every binary combination. If, now, we sum each side of this equation with respect to i, we obtain [f, g]=={[h, k] d(f, g). (24.) (the summation referring as before to h, k). But, by (23.), [h, k] is 0 unless h, k be a conjugate pair, and then it is +1; so that (24.) becomes simply V g] i d(f, be)'. (25.) an equation which, written at length in the common notation, is df dg df dg) df dg df dq\ i dyi dxi dx, dyi itdad dbi dai, The expression on the right being a function of the constants a,, &c., b1, &c. only, the equation (25.) expresses obviously the following theorem. If f=e (X1 X2, * . XW, yI * 2 n, 'yW t) gb of the system Xof Yimlt y2o ( (y t) be any two integrals of the system of simultaneous equations (16.), (17.), art. 6, then* POISSON employs the notation (h, k), which would have led to confusion if adopted here. LAGRANGE (in the Me'c. Anal.) uses [h, k], but with a different signification. See below, note to art. 34. DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS OF DYNAMICS, ETC. 83 the expression [f, g], or tdy, dx, dx, dyi4 is constant; i. e. it becomes a function of the arbitrary constants only, if for xi, &c., Y &c. be substituted their values in terms of the constants and t. In the case in which (16.) and (17.) represent the dynamical equations, this is identical with the remarkable theorem discovered by POISSON. We shall have occasion to return to it presently. 10. If we treat the equations (21.) of the last article exactly in the same way as we have treated (22.), putting u, v for any two functions whatever of the 2n variables wefind I d(u, v) d(u, v) and comparing this with the theorem (25.) of the last article, we see that both may be included in the following general enunciation: If U, v be either (1) any two functions whatever of the 2n constants a,, &c., b1, &c., or (2) any two functions whatever of the 2n variables x,, &c., yl, &c. (not containing t explicitly), then fdu dA du dA du dv du dl fd(uy, v) d(u, v) a or i{Ld(y5i, xU)+ d(b(, ai) =? .(26.) (When u, v represent functions of the constants, the differential coefficients in tile first term are taken on Hyp. II.; and, when functions of the variables, those in the second term on Hyp. I. (art. 5.)). This property depends, as will be seen, solely on the relations (5.), (I 1.), arts. 2, 5, which are the only assumptions that have been made in deducing all the preceding propositions. 11. There are similar theorems in which the sunmmation refers to the numerators of the differential coefficients; but as these are less remarkable, and moreover are deducible immediately from the equation (20.), art. 8, I shall omit them. 12. Theorem.-I proceed now to establish a theorem which may be considered as the converse of that expressed by (23.), art. 9. Let x1i ,2, ... --n, y, Y2, Y.. y,, be 2n variables, concerning which no supposition whatever is made, except that they are connected by n equations al-p 1 (Xi) X2n X* n7l YI 2)* yn)' a,=P2(X1, X2 a . .l Yi. ..

It is assumed that these equations are algebraically sufficient to determine each of the n variables y ... ye, as a function of the other n variables x1, ... xn and the constants. Then the theorem in question is as follows:If, by means of the equations (a.), the n variables yl, ... y. be expressed as functions of x1, &c., then in order that the conditions dye dy1 dxj dxi may subsist identically, it is necessary and sufficient that the expression [at, a>] (defined as in art. 9.) shall vanish for every binary combination of the n equations. This may be proved as follows: Putting h, k for any two of the constants a1, a2, &c., let h=p(x,, &c., Y1, &c.) represent one of the equations (a.) above wvritten. If in this equation the values of y1, ... yn be expressed, as above supposed, in terms of xi, &c., a,, &c., it becomes identical. Differentiating it, on this hypothesis, with respect to xi, we obtain dA dy dIA dy2 dA dyn dWx+ dl Tx, + dy, dx, + ***+ dYn dxj =; and in like manner dk dy 1A dy2 A dkdYn dxd y, dxi dy2 dx dy, dxi = and if we multiply the first of these equations by Ay and the second by Ay and subtract, there results an equation which may be written as follows: dhdk dhdk fdyAAdh dk dh AkA dyi dxz dacj dy7~Th dxikddy1 dyz dyz dy1/i or, pltting now ap, aq instead of h, k, and employing the same notation as before, d(ap, aq) = fjdy1 d(a,, a q) d(yi, xi) ladd(yn y) fII If now the terms on each side be summed with respect to i, the result on the first side is [a,, a] ; and observing that on the second side the term multiplied by d'l will only differ in sign from that multiplied by dy1' we shall have ((dy dyi d(am, aq) [ap, aq] = -iv-j -dxj d(yj, Y 4.(27.) the summation on the right extending to all binary combinations i, j. Suppose this equation to be written at length, and then after multiplying each side by d(yr, /s) d(ap, aq) let the s1uI be taken with respect to all the binary combinations p, q. It follows DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS OF DYNAMICS, ETC. 85 from the theorems of art. 1, that the coefficient of dyr dys dx1 dx, on the right will reduce itself to unity, and that of each of the remaining terms to zero; so that we shall have, writing nowj, i for r, s, dy{ dy [a,, y) } (28 ) dxi dxj q p d(ap, aq)j . . 2. In order then that the expression dyj_ dy: should vanish identically for every binary combination of indices, it follows from (28.) that it is sufficient, and from (27.) that it n(n -1) is necessary, that each of the 2 terms [a,, aJ should vanish,, and vice versd. It will be observed that the terms [a,, aJ] cannot vanish otherwise than identically, since they do not contain any of the constants a,, a2, &c., and it is by hypothesis impossible to eliminate call these constants from the equations (a.). It follows then that when the conditions [a,, aJ] =O subsist, the values of yg, ... ye expressed as above, are identically the partial differential coefficients of a function of xl, ... xn, al, ... an. We have thus established the theorem enunciated at the beginning of this article. 13. The preceding theorem may be made somewhat more general as follows:If we divide the 2n variables into any two sets of n each, so that no two in the same set are conjugate (as for instance X1n X2n GXrJ yr+l 1* . yn ,YI3 Y21 * Yri Xyr~in ad 0 n), and denote one set by 1) 02 Ae and the other by ?;711 + S2, 4 +gnt taking the + or sign according as ni represents yi or xi, it is obvious that the expression 1 i(, aq) is identical with [ar, aJ]; and therefore whenever all the terms [arp, a] vanish, if the set 41l, . 4,Ad can be expressed by means of the equations (a.) of the last article, in terms of l i, ... innL al, a., ... a,,, their values will be the partial differential coefficients with respect to 91 ~2 ... e,, of a function of these variables and of the constants. 14.

(III.). leads to the differential equations (I.) (see art. 6.). The n equations (III.) give therefore the remaining n integrals of the system (I.), of which (IL.) and (III.) together are the complete solution. The system of equations (II.), (Ill.) being the same as that discussed in the preceding articles, all the conclusions there obtained will continue to subsist. 15. Suppose the expression for Z (see the last article) in terms of the variables is Z =f(X) X2> Xn .1 . n Yl 21 * Ye t) s Z is changed into (Z) by the substitution of lfor yl, &c.; and since -t is (identically) =-(Z), the equation dX +f xdX dX \ is a partial differential equation satisfied by the function X. We have thus arrived, by an inverse route, at the point from which Sir W. HAMILTON'S theory, as improved by JACOBI, sets out. JACOBI, namely, has shown (by a demonstration immediately applying only to a particular form of the equation (X.), but easily extended), that if X be any "complete" solution of the equation (X.), that is, a solution involving (besides the constant which may be merely added to X) n arbitrary constants a1, a2, ... a., in such a way that they cannot be all eliminated from the n+ 1 equations obtained by differentiating X with respect to x,) ... x,, t, without employing all those equations, then X possesses the properties of Sir W. HAMILTON'S "1 Principal Function," or in other words, gives all the integrals of the system (I.) by means of the system (IL.), (III.).

It is obvious, from the considerations given in art. 13, that instead of the equation (X.) of the last article, we might employ any one of the analogous equations obtained by distributing the variables as explained in the article referred to, and then writing dfor ;i in the expression for Z. The function Q will be a "principal function." In particular, if -we take the equation dY o dY dY Tt / Wdl dye Y2 Yw i) =On y i any complete solution will give the integrals of the differential equations (I.) by means of the system dY dY dy xi dai The whole number of partial differential equations from each of which a " principal function" can be obtained, will obviously be 2n. The relations between these different principal functions will be apparent from the conclusions of art. 4*. 17. If xl, x2, ... xCn represent all the independent coordinates (of whatever kind) in any ordinary dynamical problem, and Ti the expression for the vis vivat in terms of Xl &c., x', &c., the equations of motion are, as is well known, (dT\F dT dU where U is a function of xj, ... x,, which may also contain t explicitly, but not x', &c.

Thus, so far as the application of any methods of integration, founded upon the preceding principles, and the theories of Sir W. HAMILTON and JACOBI, to the systemn (T.), art. 16, is concerned, there is no restriction to the form of the function T. This extension is probably at present of no practical importance, but may perhaps be thought of some interest in a purely analytical point of view. 19. Returning now to the suppositions and conclusions of art. 14, let us further suppose that Z does not contain t explicitly, so that zf= E dZ ~dZ tby virtue of the system (I.); in this case Z=h. i l e 6 D e 4 * * (. is one of the integrals of the system, and if we suppose this to be one of the n given integrals fromn which the principal function X is to be found, so that I, al, a., ... a.-, are now the n arbitrary constants, and the conditions [ar, aj]=0, [h,, aJ0O subsist, it is plain that we shall have (Z) =h, In the case in which T is homogeneous and of the second degree, in aX x cr it is obvious that the expression for Z reduces itself to-2(T) -AW,, or (T) LI DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS OF DYNAMICS, ETC. 91 since the expression for Z must reduce itself identically to h when the values of ,1 ... obtained from the integrals are substituted in it. Hence dX and therefore X--ht+V9 V being a function not containing t explicitly. We have then dXj!Y, so that V is dcv dwli to be fouhd from the n expressions dV Lastly, the n remaining integrals will be dX_ dX dal A5 dai-b (,r representing the arbitrary constant conjugate to 4); and, substituting in these the above expression for X, we obtain dh -t+-f dh.. .(29.) The function V now satisfies, and may be defined by, the partial differential equation dV dY f II0 .. XM o ) ...7 gz ) = h, .... (V.) wheref(xl, ... xn, yi, ... ye) is the expression for Z in terms of the variables. This, in dynamical problems, is the case in which the so-called " principle of vis viva" subsists. I shall, in the rest of this paper, use h exclusively in the above signification, and call it, whether actually referring to a dynamical problem or not, the "constant of vis viva," whilst the integral Z=h may be called the "integral of vis viva." 20. When the 2n integrals of the system of differential equations (I.), art. 14, are expressed in the manner which has been explained, it follows from the conclusions of former articles, that when these integrals are putt in the form ai= Pi(*i ... 5n wYll I.. yM t) bi=,+i(xl -Z . *,Y1 4,y **. tin t) n the conditions [as, bJ] = 1, [as, hJ] =0, [bc, bji =0 will subsist, as well as [ai, aj] =0. I shall call any system of 2n integrals in which these conditions are fulfilled, a " normal solution," or a system of "c normal integrals," whilst the 2n arbitrary constants contained in such a system may be called "normal elements." Any pair ai, bi, may be called (as before) conjugate elements. In the case considered in art. 19, h and r are conjugate elements, these letters being used instead of a, b, merely from obvious motives of convenience, It has been one principal object of these investigations to ascertain what advantages could be gained-either for the actual integration of a system of equations of the N 2 92 PROFESSOR DONKIN ON THE form (I.), or for the transformation of known solutions into forms convenient for the application of the method of variation of elements-by making the discovery of principal functions depend upon that of n integrals satisfying given conditions, rather than upon the solution of a partial differential equation. Having now prepared the way for this inquiry, I shall proceed with it in the following section, SECTION II. 21. Theorem.-If p, q, r be any three functions whatever of the 2n variables .,1 x,-, -I ... Y1h Y, then [np, q], r Jr+ [q, r], + [+r, p], q j = O. (30.) (The symbols have the same signification as in the last section. See art. 9.) This may be proved as follows. It is evident that if the above expression were developed, each term would consist of a second differential coefficient of one of the functions p, q, r, multiplied by afrst differential coefficient of each of the other two. Consider then the terms in which p is twice differentiated; these will be of the three forms Id2p dr d p dq dr and _d *dq. d dxidy doxd dyi dxdxj dyj dytdhy dvg each of which will arise from the first and third terms of (30.) only. (It is to be observed that i may =j.) Now if we examine each of these forms, we see easily that foe every term arising from thefirst term of (30.), there is a similar tern with the opposite sign arising from the third term of (30.); and since a similar proposition would be true of the terms in which q, r, respectively, are twice differentiated, the whole expression on the left of the equation (30.) vanishes identically. The theorem is therefore established. It is obvious that p, q, r may contain, explicitly, any other quantities (as t) besides the 2n variables with respect to which the differentiations are performed. Let g represent, either, one of the 2n variables x,, &c., yv, &c., or any other quantity whatever explicitly contained in p and q. It is evident that we shall have d [$ + rid ] ..... 3 ~[pi q]=[' ]?p #](3 1.) 22. Resuming now the consideration of the 2n simultaneous differential equations discussed in the first section, namely, IdZ __dZ x&= 4-iyi= Y-W .i . ....(.) we shall be enabled, by means of the theoremis (30.), (31.) of the last article, to give a very simple and direct proof of the proposition indirectly demonstrated in art. 9. For let u be any function whatever of the variables x,, &c., ye, &c., t; then DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS OF DYNAMICS, ETC. 93 and if the values of x, y' given by (I.) be substituted in this expression, it becomes du Let u =[p, q], then (making use of (31.)) [P) ql]= I F q + n E+ZZ) CP q]. Now suppose that, by virtue of the differential equations (I.), the values of p and q are constant; or, in other words, that P= P(Z1 &c.) y1, &c., t) q=,4(Xj, &C., Y1, &C., t) are any two integrals whatever of the system (I.); p, q representing two arbitrary constants. The equation p'=O gives (see (32.)) dp+ [Z, PI= 0, dt-IrP = or' dips _ [Z, dp hence [ V =] = [Z, p], qI=[ql [Z, Pjj In like manner jP' f=I [q) zi] Thus the expression given above for [p, q]' becomes p) q]=[p [q, ZI + Fqf [Z, P] + _ [P. q]2 which is identically equal to 0, by the theorem (30.). Consequently, for any two integrals p and q, -p, q] constant. (33.) This theorem, as has been already mentioned, was discovered, in the case of the dynamical equations, by PoIssoN; and the fact that he was able to arrive at it throuigh so long and complex a process as that which he has given in his first memoir on the Variation of Arbitrary Constants*, must be looked upon as a remarkable instance of his analytical skll. I am not acquainted with any attempt to simplifv the demonstration, except that of Sir W. LIAMILvrONt; in fact it is probable that no material simplification was attainable without the help of the transformation of the differential equations to the form (I.), towards which POISSON (as JACOBI has remarked) only made a first step. Sir W. HAMILTON'S demonstration may certainly be considered simple as compared with that of POISSON. That which I have given above will, I hope, be regarded as a further improvement. 23. In what follows I shall use such expressions as "the integral c," as an abbreviation for "the equation c=-(x1, &c., y,, &c>, t)."* Journ. de 1'Ecole Polytechnique, tom. viii. t Philosophical Transactions, 1835, p. 108-9. 94 PROFESSOR DONKIN ON THE It is of course understood that the function on the right contains neither c nor any other arbitrary constant explicitly. Let then f: g be any two given integrals of the system (I.). It has been shown that we shall always have [f, g] = constant *. ***.*.***(K*) But this equation may be true either (1) identically, or (2) not identically. In the first case the expression [ gJ may either be identically =0, or it may reduce itself identically to a determinate constant, which might always be made unity by multiplying one of the integrals by a factor. (In the case of a "1 normal system" of integrals (art. 20.), it has been seen that every binary combination gives either 0 or 1.) But if the above equation (K.) be not identically true, so that [f g] obtains a constant value only by virtue of the differential equations, then the constant on the right of (K.) is an arbitrary constant, and that equation is itself an integral. But here again there are two cases; for the function If, gJn may be only a combination of the functions on the right of the two integrals f, g; and then (K.) is not a new integral, but only a combination of the two given ones ; or, on the other hand, [f g7 may be a function independent of /; g; and then (K*) is really a new integral, which cannot be produced by merely combining the other two, Thus it appears that POISSON'S theorem may in some cases lead to the discovery of new integrals, when two are known. On this subject, and others connected with it, I refer to the interesting menmoir of M. BERTRAND in LIoUVILLE'S Journal (1852), "'Sur lint6gration des 6quations diffrentielles de la Mkcanique." 24. Let el, c2, c. aC be any m integrals, and let A g be any two functions of the m constants cl C, ., Cm, so that g are also two integrals; and considering f, g as functions of c}, ,.., G and, through them, of the variables, we have exactly as in art. 9 equation (24.), [fig g] =d~I hi V79 [cil CA] }aI...( the summation extending to all binary combinations of the m constants cr, &c.

(the summation referring as before to iij) ; and the inverse equations (obtained either by considering cl, &c. as functions of k,, &c., and reasoning in the same way, or by multiplying the above equation by d(k ') and summing with respect to p, q) will be (the summation referring top, q). This inversion can only fail in the case in which the equations expressing Icl, &c. in DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS OF DYNAMICS) ETC. 95 terms of c1, &c. are not all independent; a supposition which we exclude, in order that kj, ... ,k may represent m distinct integrals. The equations above written lead obviously to the following conclusions (1.) Iff be a given function of the m constants cl, ... Cm; then the determin'ation of another function g, such that [f, g] =0, depends in general upon the solution of a linear partial differential equation of the first order. (2.) It is impossible that the conditions [kg, kj] =0 can exist for every binary cornbination of k1, ..., kin, unless [ci, cj =0 for every binary combination of c-, m, 25. As an illustration of the first of these conclusions, we may take a case which actually occurs in many dynamical problems. Let cl, c2, c, be three integrals, such that P2, -c., = iP7 Cl]-=C2) Ecicl %]=, i 0 0 (C.) and let it be required to find a function g of cl, c2, c,, such that [c1e g] =0. The equation (L.) of the last article gives, if we putf= cl, and introduce the conditions (c.). C 0. 2d 8 The solution of which is k being an arbitrary function (which may evidently also contain cl in an arbitrary manner). If, instead off/c, we putf}p(cl+ c+ ) it will be found that the expression on the right of the equation (L.) vanishes identically; so that in this case, if g be any arbitrary function of cl, c2, c,, the condition [f/ g] =0 will be satisfied. 26. If al, a2, ... a" bl, b2, . b. be a system of normal elements (art. 20.), we have (equation (25.), art. 9.) d(a , bi) where f, g represent any two functions of the elements, or in other words, any two integrals whatever. If in the above equation we put successively f=aj, f=bi, we obtain [pa ' bdgi [ 9]= dg. * (36.) dbi In the case where the principle of vis viva subsists, we may suppose the constant of vis viva, h, to be one of the elements. In this case (see (29.), art. 19.) the element conjugate to h is r, and t appears in none of the integrals explicitly, except one, namely, the integral conjugate to h, which is dV If, then, g be any integral whatever, not containing t explicitly it cannot contain r, since any combination of the normal integrals involving , will involve it in the fLorm 96 PROFESSOR DONKIN ON THE ?+t. Consequently, for every such integral we shall have, by (36.), g, h = 0, . * * (37.) since d=0. dv This particular consequence of the formula (36.) follows also immediately from (32.), art. 22, since the equation g'=0 gives, by (32.), [Z, g =0, and in this case Z=h, so that [Z, g] =[ h, g]. In this manner the theorem expressed by (37.) has been already obtained by M. BERTRAND. Examples of the preceding Methods. 27. I shall now exemplify the principles which have been explained, by applying them to two of the most familiar as well as important problems of dynamics. First then let it be required to obtain in a normal form the integrals of the differential equations which determine the motion of a material point, acted on by a force emaanating from a fixed centre and depending only on the distance. Taking the centre of force as the origin of a system of rectangular coordinates, let mnl be the mass, and x, y, z the coordinates of the moving point. Then T=' m(x2+y!2+ z?D and U (see art. 17.) is a given function of r, say p(r , where r`=x2+yf+z'. Let us put dT dT dT so that, referring to the notation used in the preceding pages, we have X, y, z instead of xZ, x2, x u, V. w instead of y, s 13. Moreover, um=x , V=my", w=mz'. Hence we obtain Z=(T)I-U=m1(u2+v2+w2)-9(rX so that the integral of as viva, or Z=h, becomes (u2+v2+W2)-p(r) h; and the three integrals which express the conservation of areas become 5yw-zv_ c zu-xsw = C These integrals are immediately seen to satisfy the conditions [c2, C-] c[cl C,1 =c-c ,Cl C2] =c-. c from which it follows (see art. 25, the result of which is obviously unaffected by the negative signs), that if we take k=(e+Z+c)-2thcondition [-c_=0\will besatisfied DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS OF DYNAMICS, ETC. 97 (as is easily found to be true); and since neither of the integrals c3, k contain t explicitly, the conditions [Ii, c3] =0, [h, k] =0 will subsist also (art. 26.). Hence it follows that if we solved algebraically the three integrals k, c3, k so as to express u, v, w in terms of x. y, z, their values would be the partial differential coefficients of a function V, from which the three remaining integrals could be found (arts. 12 and 19.). But it is more convenient to adopt a different system of coordinates. Reverting then to the primitive form of the three integrals which we have chosen, and writing c instead of c,, we have T-U=h.(i.) m (xy' -yx')= c.(ii.) m22(xI2+yf2+ ZI2) _r2r'2) 2.(iii.) 28. Let us now employ, instead of x, y, z, the three coordinates 0, 0, z; where z is the same as before, g is the projection of r on the plane of xy, and 0 is the angle between g and the positive axis of x. We shall thus have 2+z2=r2 , X=g cos 0, yg sin 0, and T=!m(gI2+f 20!2+z) dT dT_ dT_ Let d ,--, dot-Vw d ,W I (where u and v have now a new signification), then U a I W m mg M and the three integrals at the end of the last article become, after obvious reductions, U (2+ + W2) =h+p(r). ........ (. V= C. O~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~i.) v -c.@..@...........(i i.) (gW _ U), +r2 (gw-z6)2 +-2v2= k2. ..........(iii .) The conditions [h, c] 0, [h, k] 0, [c, k] 0 continue to subsist with reference to the new variables; the two former necessarily, because (ii.) and (iii.) do not contain t (art. 26.), and the third actually, as is seen on trial (not accidentally, as will be shown hereafter). We know, therefore, that the values of u, v, w, found from these equations, will be the partial differential coefficients with respect to g, 0, z of a function V of these latter variables. C2 The two first give u2+w2=2rn(h+p(r))-?and if we multiply this by g+Z2=r2, and subtract (iii.), we obtain (introducing the condition (ii.) (gou+ z'w)2-2rnr2 (h+ (r) )-k2.

We have then (art. 19.) V=f(ud?+vdo+wdz); or, substituting the above values, V= cO+J1{e-d+f2dZ(2mr2(h+p(r)) __ C The term under the integral sign is easily seen to be (as we know 'a priori it must be) a complete differential. It is convenient however to transform it thus. First, we have ?d?+zdz=rdr; next, let the latitude of the body (or the angle between r and the plane of x,y) be X; then tan X=2, and fdz-z d?=r2d, r secX. Making these substitutions, the expression for V becomes V=cO +>r(2mr2 (h+ (r)))-k2 2+dX(k2-c2 sec2 i)2 The integration in the second term cannot be effected till the form) of the function p(r) is given: that of the third term may be more conveniently performed after the differentiations with respect to c and k, as in the next article. 29. The remaining integrals* of the problem are (art. 19.) dV dV dV Performing the operations indicated, and observing that jl kd~sJA I sin-1 ksinA 'I and sec2xdx 1s. _,( ctan X and Jv iei~ Sit tv2_C Vk2-c2 sec2x c V2c ' It would perhaps be better to use the term " integral equations" here, in order to reserve the term " integral" for the case of an equation involving only one arbitrary constant (see art. 23.). The equations a=, &C. become "integrals" in this sense, when for k, c, and h, on the left, are substituted the functions of the variables to which they are respectively equal (from (i.), (ii.), (iii.)). An " integral" in this limited meaning is what is commonly called a " first integral," when the problem is considered as the solution of n differential equations of the second order. And any equation obtained by combining " integrals" so as to eliminate a set of n of the variables xl , x2... xn, y, ye, . yn, of which no two are conjugate, corresponds to what is commonly called a "final integral." DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS OF DYNAMICS, ETC. 99 we obtain for the final integrals, myrdr{2mr2(h+ (r)) k2}`-t+. (iv.) D-S-(V= .tanx ..(v.) sin -kj{2mnr2(h+p(r))-k2 + sin-'( sj(nXc) * (vi.) C Let ?= cos ; then cot s, and the equation (v.) becomes tan X= tan i.sin (d0-) .(v.a) which expresses that the orbit is in a plane whose inclination to the plane of x, y is i. Also 3 is evidently the longitude of the node, reckoned from the axis of x. riThe last term on the left of (vi.) becomes sin-'_'inX\ s i sn ) Now if 2 be the " argument of latitude" or the angle between the node and the radius vector r, we have evidently sin a= si.n , so that the above term is simply a, and the integral (vi.) becomes E C= kfr{2mr2(h+p(r))-k2} (vi.a) 30. To apply the above expressions to the case of the undisturbed motion of a planet, we have only to put p(r)=L, where m is now the mass of the planet, and pi r the sum of the masses of the sun and planet, the origin of coordinates being placed at the sun. It would be useless to give the well-known expressions to which the integrations now lead, my object being merely to obtain a set of normal elements. Now in this case we have (by well-known theorems), if a be the semiaxis major, e the excentricity, and ? as before the inclination, h -14A) k= Vja( 1-e'), and therefore c= Vtba(1 -e2).cos:. Also, if we take for the inferior limit of the integrations in (iv.) and (vi.a) the minimum value of r, or the perihelion distance, it is plain that a will be the longitude of the node, reckoned from the perihelion in the plane of the orbit, and -r the tine of perihelion passage. Thus we have the following six elements, arranged in conjugate pails:-(time of perihelion passage) 2d V a( e1), (angle between node and perihelion) V/pa(i -e').cos a, (longitude of node). o 2 100 PROFESSOR DONKIN ON THE It is obvious that we may change the signs of the first pair. And generally, that iff, g be any two conjugate elements, we may substitute for them kf -g, where X is any determinate constant, i. e. not a function of the elements*. Trhe above elements coincide with those given by JACOBI. My object has been merely to illustrate a mode of obtaining them which seems capable of useful applications. 31. As a second example I shall apply the method to the case of the motion of a solid body about a fixed point. Let the fixed point be taken for the origin, and the principal axes of the body through that point for the axes of x, y, z. Let i, a, ; refer to the same origin and to axes fixed in space; a, b, c being the direction-cosines of the axis of x referred to the fixed axes of i, a 4, and a', 1/, c'; a", b", c" being respectively the direction-cosines of the axes of y and z. Let 0 be the inclination of the plane of x) y (or " equator") to that of i, n (or " ecliptic"); 4 the longitude of the node, reckoned from the axis of 0, and p the right-ascension of the axis of x. Then if A, B, C be the Moments of Inertia, and p, q, r the angular velocities, about the axes of x, y, z, the expression for the vis viva is T= (Ap2+Bq2+Cr2), where p=-d'cosi-41' sin p sin 0 q=0' sin @ A' cos p sin 0 r= s'++'cos 0. Let u, v, w be the variables conjugate respectively to 0, @, A, so that dT dT dT the following expressions will be found without difficulty: Ap= -u cos @P+5sin0 (v cos d-w) Bq=u sin P+ sin 0 (v Cos d-w) Cr=v. Considering at present only the case in which no forces act, we have the integral of vis viva T=h, which becomes At os 2(vcos K-w)) u sin p+ sin (v cos 0_W) +cv2=2h. .'............. . (i.) * More generally, we may substitute forf, g any two functions of them,p, q, such that dp dqdp dq1 dg df df dg a condition which requires the solution of a linear partial differential equation for the determination of one function, if the other be assumed. But on the subject of the transformation of elements see below, arts. 34, 35, 1)IFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS OF DYNAMICS, ETC. 101 The three integrals which express the conservation of areas. namely, Aap+Ba'q+Ca"r=e, Abp+Bb'q+Cb"r=f, Acp+Bc'q+Cc"r=g, become, after simple reductions, -u cos -sinO (v-w cos d)=e Cos4 -u sin k+ -si (v-w cos D)=f wag. Let e'+f'2+g'=k'; we have, adding the squares of these three equations, u2+w2+ (v-7 C So) k2.(iiC) and we may take the three equations (i.), (ii.), and W -y .. . . .. .. (iii.) as three normal integrals; the conditions [g, h]=O, [h, k]=O, [k, g]O being obviously satisfied. These three equations determine u, v, w, as functions of 0, p, 4; and supposing the three former variables to be explicitly expressed in terms of the latter, we should have at once the three partial differential coefficients gV d dV ; the determination of V would therefore depend upon simple integration, and the remaining integrals would be given by means of the three equations dV dV dY Th-tf d -Cl dk-C r, c1, c2 being new arbitrary constants. In the general case, however, the algebraical solution of the equations (i.), (ii.), (iii.) is imyipracticable, since the elimination of v and w leads to an equation of the fourth degree in u; nor does it seem possible to evade the difficulty by choosing a different combination of integrals, since it may be shown that the necessary conditions cannot be satisfied unless two at least of the combinations chosen are of the second degree in u, v, w. 32. Mr. CAYLEY has given* a solution of this problem, which, though differing totally in form and method from the above, resembles it in arriving exactly at a corresponding point. For in Mr. CAYLEY'S equations (27.), (28.), (D and v are to be expressed as functions of v'; but this requires the algebraical solution of the system (18.) for p, q, r, and is therefore impracticable. (The two equations (i.), (ii.) of the* Cambridge and Dublin Mathematical Journal, vol. i. p. 167. 102 PROFESSOR DONKIN ON THE last article are merely transformations of the two first of Mr. CAYLEY'S (1 8.); and (iii.), though not identical with the third, is of the same degree; so that the algebraical difficulty is precisely the same in both methods.) 33. If we suppose A=B, the algebraical difficulty disappears, and the solution of the problem can be explicitly completed. But on account of the importance and interest of this case I shall make it the subject of a separate section, in which it will also be shown that the solution of the general case may be made to depend upon it, by means of the variation of elements. (See Section III.) 34. Suppose any complete normal solution of the system of differential equations (I.), art. 14, be known i. e. a solution involving the 2n elements QXI> asl Ads an bel be ... bn which satisfy the conditions (23.), art. 9; then an infinite number of other sets of normal elements can always be found. For if we determine the 2n quantities i, ... A ... j3 as functions of a1, &c., bi, &c. by the 2n equations dA~b dA where A is any arbitrary function of a,.p a., 4ni all Ac 2)* aM it is obvious that the whole of the reasoning by which the formulae (19.), art. 7, were established may be repeated, merely putting A in place of X, and a, P3 instead of x,y. And repeating in like manner the reasoning of art. 9, mutatis mutandiv, it will follow that iff, g represent any two of the 2n quantities a,, &c., f3, &c., the expression d(fg) d(bt*, mi) will be equal to unity iff g be a pair of the formn a>, by, and will vanish in every other case. But it was also shown ((25.) art. 9) that the above expression is equivalent to Ifb g] ; it follows then that [doi = 1) [ail ail= [aloil kj=% [P, =0*; or, in other words, that a,,, .. ac m , .. n are a new set of normal elements. This method however can hardly be of much use in practice, because we cannot (at least without the solution of partial differential equations) detelrtmine what formI shall have occasion to refer afterwards to M. DiEsuovns' Memoir in LIOUVILLE'S Journal, vol. xiii., i Demonstration de deux thorbmes de M. JAcoBi." But it may be observed here that the proposition in the text is not the same as that expressed by the same notation in the memoir alluded to, p. 400. For M. Dxsnovxs uses the symbols [as aj] in a different sense. His theorem, in the notation of the present paper, is xi d(aj' 1j) 1or =0, according asf, g are of the form ezj, or not, which is easily established without the help of relations analogous DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS OF DYNAMICS, ETC. 103 of the function A will cause any of the new elements to be given functions of the old. But the problems most likely to occur may be solved in another way, as follows. 35. Assumtning for the set ,,l M2, ... A, given functions of the set a1, a2, ... a,, only, it is required to find f3 ... (It will be observed that the conditions [si, aj] =0 are necessarily satisfied in this case by virtue of (25.), art. 9, since a,, &c. do not involve b,, &c.) It is plain, that if the principal function X had been found from the n integrals al, a2, .. a. (as in art. 14.), it would be changed into that which would be found from the n integrals a,, a2, .. Ma,, merely by introducing the expressions for a,, ... a,, in terms of a,, .. a,,; which expressions would be found by algebraical inversion of the assumed equations which give the latter set as functions of the former. Let X represent the fuhction X thus transformed; we have then dXdX da, dXdaa dai &1 hi va2dXn =bDl+b2dar+.b.,ct . . . . . . . . (38.) Thus f is determined as a function of the old elements, since i, &c. may be expressed in terms of the latter. In like manner we should have a set of inverse equations da& da n bi-PII1 & .# + *0 * * +# do(3' which may be used instead of (38.). It is apparent that f3,, &c. will involve in general the elements a,, &c. as well as b,, &c. Conversely, if we assumed for , &c. given functions of the set b,, ... b, alone, weto (19.), but would not answer our present purpose. I regret to use symbols with a meaning different from that which custom has to some extent sanctioned; but there seemed to be only a choice of difficulties. Mr. SPOTTISWOODE has suggested to me the employment of the symbols (analogous to Mr. SYLNcsTE 's 'umbral" notation) I ddd .' Ld d d '*d* L~~~~~~~dd ds d instead of those which I have used, namely, d(u, VI WI') d~xs y, z. d(, Y.Z, ...)' If these were adopted, the two forms (p, q), [ps q] might be used without confusion in their usual significations. See note to art. 9. But although the a umbral" forms are more suggestive of the properties which belong to the above expressions as determinants, the other forms bring more into view the analogies which connect them with the differential calculus; and therefore, or the purposes of this paper, I have preferred them. And it is perhaps better, for the present, that different notations should be tried* than that any attempt should be made to fix upon a definitive system for subjects so recent as those connected with the theory of determinants. 104 PROFESSOR DONKIN ON THE should have, for determining a, &c., either of the systems d~~~b Id.\ 2 ai a= d ./ (40.) We might obtain in this way an indefinite variety of sets of elements for the case of elliptic motion, beginning with those given at the end of art. 30. But it will be better to defer this illustration till after the discussion of the Method of the Variation of Elements, which will form the subject of a future Section. 36. It results from the investigations of this and the preceding Sections that if a set of n integrals al, a,, ... a. be given, satisfying the 2 conditions [ai, aj =0, the determination of na more integrals b& ... bA, constituting, with the given ones, a complete normal set, is a determinate problem, admitting of a unique solution, and always reducible (setting aside algebraical difficulties) to quadratures. But if, out of a complete normal set, n be given of which one or more pairs are coqjuigate, then the completion of the set is no longer a determinate problem, since the remaining n integrals, containing also one oi' more conjugate pairs, admit, to some extent, of arbitrary transpositions and combinations, as is evident from considerations similar to those employed in arts. 13 and 35. Hence we should expect a priori that the problem would require the solution of partial differential equations. It appeals, indeed, at first sight, that having any n of the elements given functions of the variables, the relations established in art. 9, with the others included in the formula (21.), art. 9, would furnish more than a sufficient number of equations to determine explicitly all the partial differential coefficients of the remaining elements in terms of the variables*, at least in the case in which the principle of vis viva subsists, and the given integrals do not contain t. But it is certain from the above considerations that this cannot be the case, and therefore that the equations furnished by those conditions cannot be all independent. I have not at present attempted to show this directly, though it would probably be easy to do so. Note on art. 2, Section I. The theorem established in this article may be more shortly demonstrated as follows Since di(x4yi) (i(xidyi) + Ziyidxi) The conditions [as, bil 1, [as, by]-0, [b, b3 =0, [ai, aAj=O will give, as is easily seen, + 2 l equations; and the analogous conditions (21.), art. 9, in which the summation refers to the numerators of the differential coefficients, will give the same number, so that upon the whole we shall apparently have 3n2-n equations, to determine the 2n partial coefficients required. It is not difficult to make mistakes in this subject. I was for some time under the impression that the problem could be solved when any n independent integrals were given. Even the illustrious JACoBI himself appears to have been misled, at first sight, as to the consequences of Poissow's theorem (art. 22.). See the beginning of M. BERTRAND's Memoir mentioned above; I do not know the fact frm any other source. DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS OF DYNAMICS, ETC. 105 and YX(yidxi)-dX (by (5.)), we hav ei(xdyi)= d(X+i(iyi)) an equation which must become identical when x1, X2, &c, on each side are expressed in terms of y,, &c6 But the right side being then a complete differential of a function ofY1, Y2 &c., the left side must be so also; hence the conditions dx dxy must dyj dyi Subsist. The investigation of art. 2 shows that they do subsist, and is therefore perhaps to be preferred. SECTION Ii-.-On the Equations of Rotatory Motion. 37. Ir this supplementary section I propose further to exemplify the preceding theory by exhibiting the application of it to the problem of rotation in a more detailed form than was consistent with the plan of the former part of this essay. For this purpose it will first be desirable to anticipate the subject of a future section, so far as to give a concise deduction of the method of the variation of elements in its simplest form. 38. Variation of Elements.-Suppose a complete normal solution of the system of differential equations dZ dZ xi dy Y,+ dxi-? . J . . . . . . . .

In the undisturbed problem we have am=O, be O; i. e. the equations dai Ab ti+LZ, ai]O + [Z, b,] =O .. . (e.) (see art. 22.) subsist identically when xi, &c., y9, &c. are expressed in terms of the elements and t. In the disturbed problem, x1, &c., y1, &c. are to be the same functions of the elements and t as before; hence the equations (e.) continue to subsist identically, and therefore the values of a', b', namely, dai~r~ aidt + [Zj ail + Efl, ail by+ 4r[Z. b Jr[Q. bj, MDCCCLIV. 106 PROFESSOR DONKIN ON THE become simply a =[-[, aj], bl=[f2, b].

Ed(yj'jX0) but, by equation (26.), art. 10, this is equivalent to d (1, as) d(bj, aj)' in which fl is expressed as a function of the elements and t; and this last expression obviously reduces itself to the single term d In like manner the expression for d~~~~~~Q ~b [Q, b1] reduces itself to +7-flD; thus the equations for determining the variation of the elements are at=_dQ i= dQ .b ,..* (E.) in which fl is to be expressed as a function of the elements and tM. This will be a sufficient account of the method for our immediate purpose. 39. The following propositions in spherical trigonometry will be required. If a, b, c be the sides, and a, f3, y the opposite angles of any spherical triangle, then (COS 1 + COS p)2 (-t -os -iCOS1-coSaCos cos (a+)= 1COS -i (40.) sin a sin 3 (COS a-cOS3)2 Cos(a+-b) l +cosy (41.)

The two last are easily verified; but as the others are not so obvious, I shall give the demonstration. Putting x for the expression on the right of the equation (40.), we* The history of these remarkable formula may, I believe, be stated as followsThey were first discovered by LAGRANGE in the case in which at, b; were the initial values of xi Yi, and a contained xl, &c. but not Y1, &c. They were extended by Sir W. R. HAMILTON to the case in which &2 contains both sets of variables; and finally, by JAcoBI, to the case in which a1, &c., bl, &c. are any system of conjugate elements. JACOBI however does not appear to have published a demonstration of them, and the only one which I have seen is by M. DESBOVEs, LIoIYVILLE'S Journal, vol. xiii. p. 397, and differs essentially from that given in the text. Sir W. R. HAMILTON has pointed out the circumstance, that when a contains both sets of variables, the varying elements determined by the formula (E.) are not osculating.

Returning now to the problem of rotation, and supposing, for convenience, that the question refers to the motion of the earth about its centre of gravity, the following will be the signification of the symbols employed. A, B, C are the moments of inertia, about the principal axes of the earth, viz. the axes of x, y, z; the last being the polar axis, and the arrangement being such that the positive direction of z is to the north pole, and that the positive axis of x follows that of y in the actual rotation about the polar axis: p, q, r being the angular velocities about the three principal axes, the usual convention will be adopted as to their signs; so that in the actual case r is positive. The arrangement of the fixed axes of I, a, 4 is supposed similar to that of x, y, z, the plane of 0, t being a fixed ecliptic, and the axis of e the origin of longitudes unless another origin be expressly indicated. Then 0 is the oliquity, 4, the longitude of the vernal equinox, and p the right ascension of the axis of x; all referring to the fixed ecliptic. Let the "principal plane" signify that which, in the undisturbed problem, is the "invariable plane." Then i is the inclination of the principal plane to the fixed ecliptic, andj is the inclination of the equator to the principal plane. In the case of the earth, A is nearly equal to B, 0 never differs sensibly from i, and j is therefore always small. But these conditions are not supposed in what follows. It is assumed however that C is the greatest of the three moments of inertia. These conventions, in which it is very desirable to avoid any ambiguity, may be illustrated by the annexed figure, in which 0 represents the origin of longitudes. The angles of the spherical triangle formed by the intersection of the three planes with a spherical surface are Ij, Jr-O. and the sides opposite to them will be denoted by I, J, 0. Thus we shall have cos I=CosiCosJ CoSOcosj=C j cosiCosO sinj sin O sin i sin 0 cos O= cos i cos]sin i sinc osC . 108 PROFESSOR DONKIN ON THE And, in the figure, OTr=:, and p is measured from X in the direction Indicated by bTj~ecZ _ejl'P the arrow, which is also the direction of the rotation about the polar axis. Moreover, if the direction-cosines of the axes of x, y, z referred to the fixed axes, be respectively a, b, c; a' b', C'; a", V", cl, we shall have a = cos 4, cos psin 4, sin p cos 0 a' = cos 4 sin psin 4, cos p cos 0 a"= -sin 4sin O b = sin 4, cos p+ cos , sin p cos 0 b= -sin 4, sin p+ cos 4 cos cos G VIl COS 4, sin 0 c = Sinp SingS c= cos P sin 0 C= cos a p= -0cos4,'sin p sinQ q=0' sin p -' cos p sin V r=p 1+%Pf cos 0, hence we obtain the expressions for u, v, w employed in art. 31, viz. dh U= ---Ap cos p+Bq sin.p v= Cr d -o w=d^=--Ap sin psin 0-Bq cos psin 0+Cr cos 0 DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS OF DYNAMICS, ETC. 109 from which the following also are easily deduced U A+B20+ 2 B(0'cos 2;+Yt'sin 0 sin 2p) V C('+ 4' cos 0) w+2 by sin2 0+C cos 0 (p'+k bycos O)+ 2 sin 0 (0? sin 2p-by4 sin 0 cos 2p). 41. Resuming the three integrals (i.), (ii.), (iii.) of art. 31, we may put the first in the following form: ,Z+il=h, . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . (i.) in which 2Z=-(k+ )(U2+ c?2oW)2) + 2 sinsi 1/ (v Ct(os 0 W)2\ 2u(vcos6-w).21 S-2 ABlV -sin26 v ose sino sl 0 and the other two are, as before, W2+u2+ (V-W Cos )2k (i w =g e(iii) in which k is the sum of areas on the invariable plane, and g the sum on fixed ecliptic; moreover vCr= is the sum of areas projected on the plane of the equator; hence we have g=kcosi, v-kcosj. It has been seen that the complete solution of the problem is impracticable in the general case, on account of an algebraical difficulty. If however we suppose B=A, this difficulty disappears; and after completing the solution on this supposition we ,may take account of the terms arising from the inequality of A and B, by treating the function denoted above by f2 (equation (i.)) as a disturbing function, and applying the method explained in art. 38. Thus when the action of disturbing forces is considered, the whole disturbing function will consist of two parts; one depending upon the forces, and the other the function which has just been assigned, and of which the effect, as will be seen, is extremely simple. 42. We proceed then first to complete the solution on the supposition A=B. The three integrals (i.), (ii.), (iii,) give in this case 2C v RCwAfk-2Ak), w=g. . . . . . . .

(454 110 PROFESSOR DONKIN ON THE and we shall have (art. 19.) V=k(Y cos i+p cosj)+udd; .(46.) and we will take h, cos i, cosj for normal elements*, so that k is to be considered as a function of these elements, given by the equation (see (44.)) k2 2AC/t(7. C-(C-A) cos2j.(47) It is to be observed, that, according to the hypotheses admitted above, k is positive; also, the expression for u at the end of art. 40 becomes, in the case now considered, u=AdO. Thus u has the same sign as 0'; and since 0 is evidently comprised between 2,i-j and i+j, if we suppose i andj both acute (as in the figure), sin d is always positive; hence in the expression (45.) for u, we have to attribute the sign + or -to the radical according as d is increasing or diminishing, or according as e is between o and r, or not; thus, in the position represented in the figure, the negative sign must be taken. 43. If we put +Q for the radical in question, the expression for udd is easily transformed into the following, namely, k sin odo 1I (Cosj Cosi) 21 (CoSj+ cosi)22 ud0=? Q al%2 1CoOS 2 1+ CoOS f in which it is evident that the part within brackets is positive upon the whole, but each of the two last terms is essentially negative.

Now the expression for udO (from which this is derived) shows that the three terms in the above value of P must be so interpreted that the differential coefficient of the first (with respect to d) shall be positive,and those of the two others negative. These conditions will be satisfied by taking* +p=,r_@+ cosj+ cos(I+J) 2 2 -(-(I -J)) + K (in which the upper sign is to be taken when ? is between o and a', and the under sign when 0 is >Xr). Hlence, assuming the arbitrary K so as to destroy the constant part of the expression, we have, without ambiguity, for all values of the variables, fudO=k(?-I cosj-J cos i), so that, finally, V=k{(;-I) cosj+(P-J) cosi+?}. . (48.) It will be observed that without attention to the proper interpretation of ambiguous symnbols, a completely erroneous expression for V might have been obtained. 44. The final equations will be (art. 19.) dY dV dY dh t +'r dcosi-' dcosj A' , o, fm being three new arbitrary constants, namely, the elements conjugate respectively to h, cos i, cosj. In performing the differentiations, it is to be remembered that I, J, ? do not contain h; and that, by the equations (42.), (43.), art. 39, the terms arising from the differentiation of I, ,J. 0 with respect to i and j, disappear identically, so that these functions may be considered as exempt from differentiation.. Also we have dk k dk {~~~ ) ~~~dh 2h' d cosiX dk (C-A)k3cosj dcosj 2ACh * Ia the figure, as 8 diminishes (i and j remaining constant) 0 increases, I + J increases, and I-J increases or sin ._ 2 diminishes according as ii, since tan I tan 2 sin 112 PROFESSOR DONXIN ON THIE (see equation (47,)), and the final equations become, after simple reductions, e cosi +I8 Cosj k ?,-1=-(ARC) cosj.

The first gives imnmediately * . i .... /~k a Cos i ++ CosjX Cos 0= Cos i cosj'i sin i7sinj cos X(tt+T) -O ) (see art. 40.); and since I, J are given explicit functions of 0, the three variables d, p,; are determined explicitly as functions of 1. The third equation (R.) simply expresses that the invariable plane intersects the ecliptic in a fixed line, whose longi-n tude is 45. Let us now introduce the supposition that A and3 B are unequal, and that the body is acted on by disturbing forces, We must (see art. 41.) put -(A?1) instead of in the equations (R.) of the last article; these equations will express the solution of the problem, the elements being nlow variable, and determined as functions of t by the system of equations A= dr (Cos i)-d (cosj d=; _dO i,= d(D . I _ d(D dIh dcosi' d cosj where cD is the disturbing function, expressed in terms of the elements and 1. 46. If there are no disturbing forces, (T reduces itself simply to (2 (art. 41.), which is now to be transformed by means of the equations (R.), art. 44, as follows. Since v=kcosj, and w=kcosi, we have v cos 9-w -cosicosj cos O . 1 n k s ---ksinjcosI Also the expression for u, art. 42, is easily put in the following form: mU ^ iasin' i sin2j (cos 0-cos i cosj)5 k (with respect to the sign, see art. 42.). And since sin e sin I sinG sin this becomes u=m k sinj sin L DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS OF DYNAMICS, ETC. 113 Introducing these expressions in the value of ?7 (art. 41.), we find k2 /1l\ fl=-4 (A--3 sin"j cos 2 Q-J).(49.) and when p-l is expressed in termis of the elements and t (see equations (R.), art. 44, in which -2(+F3 is now to be written for this becomes, finally, f2=-4 (A.-B) sinij.cos 2 [ -2 ( 4 + B -k)k cosj . (t+)]. . . 47. The above expression for f2 does not contain the elements i, o; hence, when there are no disturbing forces, we shall have (cos i)'=O, a'=O, or i and a are constant; also A dkd dk dfl dh dr dcosjd/3 an expression which is easily found to vanish identically (see the values of dk, dk hd cosj in art. 44, observing to put 2(k?B) for A). Thus k is also constant; and the "principal plane" is still the " invariable plane," as we know a priori. 48. If we now suppose the attraction of another body to be introduced as a disturbing force, we shall have to take for the disturbing function where fl is the same as above, and P is the potential of one body upon the other, expressed as a function of the elements and the time*. And it follows from the remarks of the last article, that the variation in the position of the principal plane depends wholly upon P, and not upon Q2. I shall here conclude this part of the subject, as it would be beyond the scope of this essay to enter into the details of any of the various problems which might be taken in illustration of the theory, such as those which relate to precession and nutation, or, to the motion of the moon about its centre of gravity. The investigations of this section have been introduced, because the results, so far as they go, appeared interesting in themselves, and afforded a remarkable example of the application of the general method. P.S. Since the last sheets of this essay were in type, I have seen for the first time two papers by Professor BRIOSCHl, in ToRTOLTNI's Annali for August and October 1853, of which the titles are I Sulla variazione delle costanti arbitrarie nei problemi della Dinamica," and " Intorno ad un teorema de Meccanica." I have not had an opportunity of examining them sufficiently to judge how far any of the preceding investigations may have been anticipated in them.
