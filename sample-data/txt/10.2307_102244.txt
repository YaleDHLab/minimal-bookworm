An Exact Account of the Three late Conjunctions of Saturn and Jupiter, (within the space or less than seven months according to accurate Observations) viz. Octob. 14.82, &c. Together with an Account of what other Conjunctions of them there happened for more than 100: years last; beginning at the year 1563: And a Table Computed whereby to make an estimate of what other Conjnnctions have happened for the time past, or that will happen for the time to come. All by J. F. Astron. Reg. & R. S. S. WHilst the Common People have dmired to see the two Superior Planets Saturn and Jupiter continue so near each other the whole year, and our Astrologers have affrighted them with fearful Predictions of direful events to succede this appearance, the more (245) more Judicious are defirous to know how often and at what time their Conjunctions happen, that by compareing their Tables of these Planets Motions with the observed appearance, they may be the better able to correct them and render them more agreeable to the Heavens. Examineing our Ancient Ephemerides I do not find that Three Conjnnctions of Saturn and Jupiter have ever hapned in one years space, since they were first in use to this present. Those of Moletius Calculated from the Alphonfine Tables indeed make three in the space of Eight Months betwixt August 1563. and April 1564 inclusive. But the Ephemerides of Stadius Calculated from the Prutenick, make onely one, on the 26 of August of which Junctinus gives us the following Observation in the Preface to his Astronomical Tables. Anno 1563. Augusti 24.hora 14. 30 post Meridiem Aurangae, Jupiter a parte septentrionis cooperiebat quasi Saturnum, qui erat a parte Meridionali, utraque dutem harum Stellarum, in fine 28 gradus Cancri deprehendebatur, Riccioli hence concludes that the Planet Jupiter covered some part of Saturn at this time. But without reason, for the words quasi cooperiebat intimate not that the one did corporally cover the other, but rather that there was some small Interval betwixt them. The Caroline tables make the visible latitude of Saturne now 11' 45'', of Jupiter 20' 10' both North, the Conjunction being some few dayes past: but because their latitudes alter slowly we may hence conclude the difference 8' 25' to have been nearly theirdistance at that time,these Tables be ing grounded on the Tychonick observations made within less than 40 years after, and shewing the Latitudes of the Planets well at this time near 100 years later we may conclude to have answered them as well then; and if we consider how small a space the distance of 8 1/2 minutes appear to the naked eye in the Heavens, especially betwixt two such bright Planets as Saturn and Jupiter are, that the Caroline distance agrees very well with the words of JunctiK k nus Conjunction in ~ ~ 1563 (246) nus and that Riccioli was grossly mistaken, 1583. Their next Conjunction according to Maginu ss Ephemerides founded on the Prutenick numbers, was April 29. 1583. in 21. deg. of ~, the Sun being then in 17. deg. of ~ so thatthe Planets riseing before him in signes of short ascention and with South Latitude this congress could not be observed by the noble Tycho who was mindful of it as appears by this note in pag. 55. of his Historia Caelestis May 30. A. M. quo primum post Conjunctionem Saturnum vidimus, captae sunt distantiae inter Jovem & Saturnum per Radium. h 1 0 1 hora 1 47 3 24 1 50 3 24 The same Ephemerides shew the next Conjunction of Saturn and Jupiter 1603. Dec. 14. at noone, in 9~ 36~ of~ 1603. but the Ingenious Kepler and our Sr. Christopher Heydon found it by observation seven days sooner, or the Seventh day of the same month in the Morning, in near Eight degrees of ~ the Planets being then but newly emerged from the Rayes of the Sun. The Ephemerides of the Learned Kepler Calculated from his own Rudolphine Tables make the next Conjunction 1623 1623. betwixt the 7th and 8th of July, in 6o 46~ of ~, the Planet Saturn being then only 4 minutes to the North of Jupiter, but this first Conjunction in the fiery T rigon hapning under the Suns beams was not observable. 1643. By the same Tables, and Ephemerides of Fichstade Calculated from them, these Planets met again in the 25th dedree of ~, betwixt the 15th and 16th of Feb. 1643, with a degree difference of Latitude. 1663. By the joynt consent of Eichstades and our Wings Ephemerides the same Planets were in Conjunction again, 1663 on the 10th of October at Noone in 13~. 30~ of ~ with one degree difference of Latitude, this Conjunction was observeable (247) servable after Sun-set in our Latitude,but I hear not that any one observed it. In every of these years there happened only one Conjunction of the two Superiors, nor is it possible that there should be more except the Heliocentrical Conjunction fall near the Opposition of the Sun; for then there may be Three, Two Direct, and One Retrograde,as has been within the space of Seaven Months, betwixt October and May last inclusive, of which the true times are determined from the following Observations. 1682. h. 1 Octob. 5. 17. 51. betwixt the Centers of Sat. & Jup. 34 54. 54 rep. 34 48. 12 13.h 49~. betwixt their Centers 16 02. 54. rep. 16 04 14 03.

K k 2 The (248) The distances betwixt the Planets were measured with the Micrometer and sixteen foot Glass, from the fixed Stars with the Sextant: those of the twelfth day by my asistant my self being then very ill of the Stone, the rest by my self. I took no distances on the seventeenth day for determining their Latitudes not being well able to abide longer in the cold Air: these if requisire may be borrowed for present use from the Caroline tables, which by continual observations and experience I find not very much erroneous in the Latitudes of the Planets. On the 22 day the Planet Jupiter was in consequence of Saturn something less distant from him then he had been observed on the fift day near the same hour. Hence the middle time betwixt these observations is pointed out for the time of their true Conjunction, but to determine it more accurately I shall examine the observations made with the Sextant on the seventeenth day which being nearest the time are most proper for this purpose. The correct Longitude of the Heel of Castor is now ~ ~ O~ 50~ 42~ its Latitude 51~ 40~ South. The Latitude of Saturn by the Caroline tables 56~ 20~ of Jupiter 41~ 30~ both North. By the assumed Latitude of Saturn 56~ 20~ and his distance from the Heel of Castor observed and corrected 48o 32~ 30~. I find their difference of Longitude 48o 30~ 37~ therefore Saturn in Leo 19o 21~ 19~. By the Latitude of Jupiter assumed 41~ 30~ and his distance from the Star 48o 45~ 20~: their difference of Longitude 48o 43~ 56~ and Jupiter's place in Leo, 19~ 34~ 39~. Hence Jupiters place in Consequence of Saturns 13~ 20~ with which and the distance of their centers observed the same night 20~ 12~, I find the true difference of their Latitudes 15~ 20~ but half a Minute different from what I assumed it on the Authority of the Tables. The apparent motion of Jupiter from the fourteenth to the (249) the eighteenth day of October by an Ephemeris exactly calculated and made agreeable to these observations is 29~ 16~, of Saturn 15~ 01~ both direct, hence the motion of Jupiter from Saturn in four days is 14~ 15~. I say therefore as four days motion or 14~ 15~ is to four days or 96 hours. so is 13~ 20~, which Jupiter is past the Conjunction of Saturn; to ninety hours or three days eighteen hours, the Time interlapsed since the Conjunction, which taken from the Seventeenth day fifteen hours, the time of my observation gives the true time of the Conjunction of the two Planets on the thirteenth day One and Twenty hours after Noon or according to the common account, the fourteenth day at Nine a Clock in the Morning At which time Saturn is with Jupiter in 19o o~71/5 of Leo with 15~ 1/~ more Northern Latitude. The Acta Eruditorum Lipsiensia Pag. 366 make this Conjunction to have happened the same day in the same Longitude with the Eleventh Star of Leo; whose place they State in Leo 19o 04~ Latitude o 16~ North,with fourteen Minutes difference of Latitudes betwixt the two Planets. But their observation seems to have been made onely by the judgment of the bare eye, without an instrument, which condered, I wonder not that it differs at all, but rather that the difference is so small from this determination. 1 6 8 3.

The Retrograde motion of Jupiter from Saturn in four days, betwixt the twenty sixth and thirtieth of this Month, by my correct Ephemeris is 121 15~ I say therefore as 12~ 15~ is to four days or 96 hours; so is 10~ 00~ the difference of the Planets present Longitudes to 78 hours or three days six hours, which therefore added to the time of that observation January the 26d 9h ~ gives the true time of the Con(252) ~ Jan 29. 16. hours after noon or according to the common account January the 30. at Four a Clock in the Morning At which time both the Planets are in ~ 16. 41. 1/5 with 11 1/~ min. difference of Latitude or Distance from each other Which is further confirmed by the measured distances of the Planets on the 30 at night before recited. On the 26. day at 9h 40~ the suns true place was by my Tables in ~ 17o 21~ 1/2 so that He was now about 1/~ of a degree past their opposition.

M. as follows. Saturn from the Lyons heart 10 58 50 Jupiter from the same 10 59 00 Saturn from h in the Lyons head 8 39 40 Jupiter from the same 8 55 35 Hence the true Longitude of Sat. ~ 14 27~ 42~ Lat. 1o 12~ 46~ North of Jupiter ~ 14 26 37 Lat. 0 56 43 North Difference of Longitude 1 04 Lat. 16 03 The Difference of Latitueds something exceeds the Distance measured with the Micrometer, by reason that the Wind then shaking the Sextant permitted us not to be so exact as usually, but the difference,being less than half a minute,I esteem inconsiderable. The diurnal motion of Jupiter from Saturu was now 3~ 15~ it holds therefore as 3~ 15~ one days motion, is: to one day or Twenty Four hours: so 1~ 04~ the Distance of Jupiter from the ~ with Saturn to Eight hours, the interval betwixt the observation and following Conjunction, which was therefore 17 h after Noon, or according to the vulgar reckoning, May the Eighth at Five a Clock in the Morning. At which time the true place of the Planets is ~ 14o 28~ 1/4 the difference of their Latitudes 15~ 40~ Saturn being so much more Northerly than Jupiter In all or best esteemed Astronomical Tables extant the mean motions of the Planet Saturn are too swift, of Jupiter too slow L l con(254) considerably, hence it came to pass that they made the direct Conjunctions some days later, the Retrograde earlyer then they were found by observation. Argolus gives the first Conjunction October the Twentieth at Noon, in ~ 19o 55~. above six days later and 48 min. forwarder in the Ecliptick than it appeared. The second January the Nineteenth at Midnight in ~ 17~ 56~ above ten days earlier than it was observed, and 1 1/4 deg. short of its true place in the Ecliptick. The last Conjunction he hath May the Sixteenth in the Evening in ~ 15o 35~, Nine days later than it really was, and in above x deg. less Longitude. h ~ By Keplers Rudolphine Tables January 26 9 40 The place of Saturn is ~ 17o 21~ 10~ his Latitude 1o 11~ 18~ N but was observed ~ 16 57 10 his Latitude 1 13 10 Difference 24 00 1 52 The place of Jupiter ~ 16 51 29 Latitude 1 04 28 observed ~ 17 07 10 1 01 30 Difference 15 41 2 58 The Errors of the Caroline and British Tables of our Countrymen are somewhat less than these, but other Tables generally differ more, as those that are desirous to be informed will find by compareing their own Calculations with the Observations before recited. Riccioli in the Second part of the first Tome of his Almagest, has given us a Table of all the mean Conjunctions of the Two Superiors from the Creation to the year of Christ 2358. but very Cou se and incorrect. I have therefore made a New one for 43 Revolutions which are Compleated 853 Julian Years, and 235 days from their correct mean Motions. This being the Period of the greatest Conjunctions after which space of time they return to the same place of the Zodiack within ~ of a degree. The Ordinary Conjunctions happen once in Twenty Years or more precisely in 19. Julian Years and 312. days, in which time (255) time Saturns mean motion is 8s 02~ 48~ ~, Jupiter's the same above one Revolution. These are commonly termed the Lesser of the great Conjunctions, which continue in Signs of the same Triplicity for 10. Revolutions to each other or ~ Years: each Conjunction according to the mean Motions being 8s 02~ 48~ 1/2 removed from the Preceding, so that if any Conjunction was made upon the first point of ~ the next following shall be in ~~ 48~ of ~ and all the following for 198 years shall fall in ~ ~ and ~, signs of the same Triplicity. But the Eleventh Conjunction after shall happen in the first degree of~ and the following ~ Conjunctions in ~ ~ and ~, Signs of the same Triplicity. Of these the First is called by our Astrologers the Greater Conjunction. But the greatest is, when after 43 Conjunction s compleated in 853 years 235 days, the mean Conjunctions having been made in all the signs return to that point of the Ecliptick from whence they began: tho I must confess had I been to name them I should have called those the Greatest which happen in the signs ~ and ~ because then the Planets rise highest, and are longest visible in our Horizon, as also being near their North Nodes, they approach nearest,and if they have any extraordinary influence (which Naboyd thinks either they have nor, or if they have, we und rstand not) it must according to their Axiomes be strongest. Those which happen in ~ and ~ I should call the Greater or Middle,because the Planets being then near their South Nodes,may approach each other again very nearly tho they rise not high in our Horrizon, being in Southern Signs; the rest might be ~ ccounted the Lesser or Ordinary. The mean Con unction of Saturn and Jupiter this year 1683. was on the Fourteenth day of January old ~tile at 12 hours after Noon in the Meridian of London, at which time the mean motions of both the Planets were 4~ 11~ 45~ L l 2 this (256) this may be the Radix for the Following Table. By which to find the time of any mean Conjunction past or future nearest to any place of the Zodiack For times past, substract the Longitude of the given place from the Longitude of the Radix 4s 11~ 45~ the residue seek in the last Column of the lable; if you find not the precise number take the next to it, against this you have in the second Column the years and days, and in the first the number of Conjunctions past since any was made in that place, Substract the Years and days from 1683.January the Fourteenth and the motion from 4s 11~ 15~ so have you the true time of the mean Conjunction, and Longitudes of the Planets hen. But For Times to come Substract the Radix from the given place; seek the Residue as before in the last Column; if you find it not,take that you find nearest it; against which, as before, you have in the second Column, the years and days; in the first, the Revolutions future, for Example. If it were required to know when the last Conjunction in the first degree of ~ Substracting ~ or Ten signs from 4s 11~ 15~ the residue 6s 11~ 15~ which seeking I cannot find in the Third Column of the Table,but I find 6s 12~ 56~ which is not two degrees more, and against them 516. years 57 days, and in the first Column 26. for the number of Conjunctions interlapsed. Substracting 516 years 57. days from 1683 Jan. 14. there remains 1166 years 322. days, which shews me that the Conjunction was in the year 1166 Nov. 18. and Substracting the motion 6s 12~ 56~ from 4s 11~ 45~ it points me to the place in 9s 28~ 49~. Or if the time of the first Conjunction in ~ to come were demanded. I substract the Radix 4s 11~ 45~ from Six Signs the residue 1s 17~ 15~ I seek in the Table but find it not, I take therefore the next to it 1s 20~ 29~ the next to it against which stands 357 years 124 days these added to ~ January 14 give me the year 2040 and 138 days ~ the 18 for the time of this Conjunction and adding the (257) the 1s 20~ 20~ to ~the Radix 4s 11~ 45~ it makes 6s 02~ 14~ for the ~ mean Longitude of this Conjunction. From the mean Conjunction the Apparent may be found by the help of Planetar Instrument, or the usual Astronomical Tables; but ~ method I leave to the Judgment of the Skilful Artist, onely adviseing him that in stateing these Conjunctions I have not made use of any extant Tables, but of such Numbers as I have corrected by very late Observations compared with the Ancient.
