[ 79 ] V. On the measurement of high temperatures. By JAMES PRINSEP, Esq. Assay Master of the Mint at Benares. Communtcated by PETER MARK ROGET, M.D. Secretary of the Royal Society. Read December 13, 1827. IF all the experiments had been recorded, which at different times must undoubtedly have been made on the subject of Pyrometry, by those engaged in operations requiring the accurate, management of fire, the catalogue would consist principally of abortive attempts, if not of decided failures. The efforts to obtain exact measurements of high temperatures have probably been abandoned, partly from the occurrence of unforeseen difficulties, partly from the uncertainty of the results obtained: such, at least, appears to be the only way of accounting for the blank presented in this interesting and practically important branch of chemical knowledge. In the admeasurement of the lower portions of the scale of temperature, and the determination of the proper methods of graduation, and the laws of expansion, gaseous tension, &c. a great degree of accuracy has been introduced. To the extent of the boiling point of mercury, indeed, we have tolerably exact values of the dilatation of metals and fluids; and by Messrs. DULONG and PETIT'S experiments, the table has been extended to the irregularities of the thermometric indications of several substances, compared with the supposed uniform expansion of air, or of any other gas in a dry state. But with respect to the measure of heat produced by furnaces, until Mr. DANIELL recently took up the subject, we only find upon record the invention of Mr. WEDGwooD'S pyrometer; an instrument the indications of which are assumed in every chemical work as authority for some doctrines relative to the scale of temperature, which savour of the marvellous; and for others, which a slight practical acquaintance with metals and crucibles must at all times have proved to be fallacious. As an example of the latter, I will only adduce the instance of the fusing point of copper, which, in Mr. WEDGWOOD'S table, is 80 MR. PRINSEP ON THE MEASUREMENT OF HIGH TEMPERATURES. placed, on the authority of Mr. ALCHORNE, considerably below that of silver; whereas if a crucible containing the two metals in a state of purity be carefully heated, the silver may be seen to flow round the copper some little time before the latter yields to the fire. When I assert that so little progress has been made in pyrometry, however, I must be understood to refer only to the absolute measurement of high temperatures; for which purpose Mr. WEDGWOOD himself never considered his instrument qualified, although it was well adapted to the practical purpose of ascertaining deviations from a regulated heat required in any process of the arts. In this branch of the subject we may no doubt find numerous contrivances on record, which the ingenuity of different artists has at different times *suggested. Most igneous operations, however, such as enamelling, assaying, foundry, &c. furnish tests of themselves on which the workman can generally place all the confidence he requires. It is needless to describe the devices invented to indicate the mere comparative heat of fires: the principle of most of them consists in making a bar of some metal traverse the middle of the furnace, and act, by its elongation or otherwise, upon a convenient piece of mechanism outside. I have myself long made use of such a bar, carrying at one extremity an index on the compensation principle, made of silver and gold: and I only advert to it here that I may take the opportunity of noticing a curious circumstance brought to light by its constant use during five years. The heat communicated to this compound index can never have much exceeded the melting point of lead, or about 7000 FAHR., and yet the surface of the gold has gradually become perfectly discoloured, and apparently penetrated by the silver, in the same manner as would have been produced by mercury at a common temperature. This effect commenced on the edges of the slip of metal, and has now advanced nearly over the whole surface of the gold, giving it the appearance, under the microscope, of being studded over with hard tubercles of a leaden colour. The golden yellow, where it is not yet thoroughly changed, has become green like that of an alloy of gold and silver. The impregnation has extended to a considerable depth in the gold, and consequently the index has become less and less sensible to changes of temperature. But I should remark, that at the fixed end of the plate, where MR. PRINSEP ON THE MEASUREMENT OF HIGH TEMPERATURES. 81 a piece of platina foil had been joined, to strengthen and support the index, no discoloration has taken effect, the platina covering seeming to shelter the gold from the argentine vapours. I should also remark, that the two metals were originally quite pure, and were united without any alloy, by simply laying an ingot of silver over one of gold, and heating the two until the former just began to melt; the compound ingot was then laminated. Mr. FARADAY has shown that mercury emits vapour capable of amalgamating with gold at very low temperatures. The circumstance just described tends to prove that silver does the same while yet in a solid state, and below the lowest red heat visible in the dark. I unfortunately omitted to keep any note of the original weight of the bar, and am therefore unable to say whether any sensible diminution has taken place. To return from this digression.-In the Journal of the Royal Institution, vol. xi. Mr. DANIELL has described an ingenious instrument, with which he measured the fusing points of many metals, and which has served to remove many of the anomalies of our so long undisputed catalogues. It may, however, be urged against his pyrometer, that platina has a smaller dilatation than every other metal, which is again diminished by the expansibility of the inclosing case of black-lead; and, moreover, that plumbago is acknowledged to be a very bad conductor of heat, and is liable to lose its shape. There does not appear by Mr. DANIELL'S account, to have been a desirable accordance in the result of different trials, excepting in the two experiments upon the fusing point of silver. In the present day such a' laudable jealousy of invention exists among scientific men, that it would be dangerous, even in this remote part of the world, to pass over any thing connected with my subject, lest I should be suspected of plagiarism in what I may hereafter offeras my own. I should therefore notice that Dr. URe has recommended an air thermometer made of platina,; but I cannot learn whether his plan has ever been carried into effect*. Sir JAMES HALL has also announced that he has found a mneans of measuring furnace heat ; and the world will no doubt receive it with the confidence due to the ingenuity of the illustrious inventor. $ I find since, that the instruments have been made for sale; but I have seen no statements of experiments made with them, MDCCCXXVIII. M 82 MR. PRINSEP ON THE MEASUREMENT OF HIGH TEMPERATURES. The mind often speculates upon such subjects without bringing. its crude ideas. into practical form. I have at one time thought that the light, and consequently heat, of a fire might be admirably measured by the eye, with the intervention of a series of thin plates of coloured glass or talc; the number necessary to obscure the lightbeing the indication of the heat. It would be difficult, without actual trial, to estimate the objections to a photometer of this kind, from which doubtless some useful observations might arise: the intense heat of the oxy-hydrogen blowpipe, the fusion of platina, and other refractory metals, might thus be roughly estimated. The dark brown mica is well adapted for the construction of such an instrument, which might be made of one or two hundred thin laminae pasted on card frames. The eye should be protected from extraneouslight by means of a dark tube during observation. After trying various plans, I have at last fixed upon, one which appears to have superior claims to accuracy; and possesses the great advantage of being identifiable at any time and in any part of the world. The fusing points of pure metals are determinate and unchangeable; they also comprehend nearly the whole scale of temperature: the unoxidable, or noble metals, alone embrace a range from the low melting point of silver to the high ignition 'of platina. There are, it is true, only three fixed points in this scale; but as many intermediate links may be made as are required, by alloying the three metals together in different proportions. VWhen such a series has been once prepared, the heat of any furnace may be expressed by the alloy of least fusibility which it is capable of melting. Besides the unity of determinations which such a pyrometer would give, several other advantages might be enumerated :-the, smallness of the apparatus; nothing more being necessary than a little cupel, containing in separate cells eight or ten pyrometric alloys, each of the size of a pin's head :-the indestructibility of the specimens; since those melted in one experiment would need onlyto be flattened under the hammer to be again ready for action :-and the facility of notation; since three letters with the decimal of the alloy would express the maximum heat: thus, pyrom. S .3 G might be used for an alloy of 0.7 silver with 0.3 gold, and G .23 P would express gold containing 23 per cent of platina. Having thus explained the principles of my proposed pyrometer, I proceed MR. PRINSEP ON THE MEASUREMENT OF HIGH TEMPERATURES. 83 to describe the circumstances worthy' of notice which occurred in the preparation of the alloys. As gold melts at a heat not very much. above silver, I assumed only ten degrees between them, measuring each by a successive addition in the alloy of 10 per cent of gold to the pure silver; the tenth degree being, of course, measured by pure gold. These alloys are easily made, and require no cominent: in accurate, researches they may be further subdivided, using always the decimal notation. From the fusion of pure'gold to that of pure platina, I assumed 100 degrees, adding one per cent of the latter metal to the alloy which measured each successive degree. Now, it is hardly to. be supposed that the progress of these hypothetical degrees represent equable increments of heat; they will however, as I before observed, always, indicate the same. intensity; and their absolute value, as a matter rather of speculative than of practical interest., is to be sought by other expedients, such as. the expansion of. a platina bar, &c. in co-operation with the pyrometric cupel. I shall 'hereafter have to show how this has been practised in measuring the melting point of silver. It was as long ago as the year 1821 when I made up the first twenty alloys -of platina and gold; the metals were in a state of purity, and the proportions were adjusted to less than the thousandth part of the unit of each specimen, which weighed precisely 15 grains troy. The metals were fused in a powerful forge, supported on a small bone-ash cupel, and inclosed in an earthern crucible. The .access of air was prevented as 'far as possible, and in some cases the metal was wrapped in paper to prevent the separation of small particles. I am thus particular in describing minutely the process 'of fusion, because some unexpected circumstances presented themselves in the fused buttons, which I believe have not hitherto been observed. Upon examining the specimens on their return from the fire, some were found to have gained considerably in weight; these were always more or less brittle under the hammer: others returned of the same weight as at first; and some few had even lost slightly in weight, and these, especially the latter, proved perfectly malleable. They were also of a brighter colour, and more deeply crystallized on the surface with the curiously knotted' retiform indentations so peculiar to the alloys of platina. I cannot here refrain from indulging in a few remarks upon the cause of m 2 84 sMR. PRINSEP ON THE MEASUREMENT OF HIGH TEMPERATURES. this phaenomenon. Neither gold nor platina, alone, were known to have the faculty of absorbing oxygen at high temperatures; and yet I could attribute the increase to nothing else, as carbon in many cases was not present, and the cupel exhibited no trace of being acted upon; excepting now and then where a paper covering had been employed, when the phosphate of lime had assumed, *under the metallic button, a beautiful bright blue colour, resembling that of phosphate of iron. I soon satisfied myself that no carbon had been absorbed, by submitting a portion of the suspected metal to solution in nitro-muriatic acid. Neither could I obtain traces of silex, nor of any other earth; although .M. BousSINGAULT has observed that platina may even be readily fused by combining it with silex, which is effected by heating the metal in a crucible lined with wood charcoal: the metal in such case becomes brittle, and gains about one per cent in weight; but the silex is regularly discoverable by its forming a jelly on solution in aqua regia, which was by no means the case in my experiments. I am rather inclined therefore to believe, although unable to confirm the supposition for want of due examination, that the increase of weight must be attributed to oxygen, as has been proved by Mr. LuCAS to be the case with ,regard to silver and copper. But the former of these metals gives out, at the moment of its becoming solid, the oxygen absorbed while it was in a liquid state: and copper, when quite brittle from the presence (as is supposed) of oxygen, may be restored to its malleable state by what is technically called poling; that is, by bringing carbon in contact with the melted metal: whereas when I remelted one of the platina alloys in an envelope of leather, it gained additional weight, and became more brittle than before.-The subject must be left for future examination. -The following Table will explain more fully the effect to which I have alluded. I have continued the series of alloys up to 70 per cent of platina, but that and the previous specimen were not fused in the highest forge heat. G .55 P. was only half melted by the intense heat capable of fusing the cupel of Gualior clay in which it was supported. MR.

I shall now proceed to: mention a few trials made with my pyrometric alloys in different furnaces and in different parts of the same furnace. The disparity of heat is greater than might -have been supposed: and where, as in assaying the precious metals, so-much depends upon the temperature at which the operation is performed, it would be useful to know every difference in this respect obtaining in various countries, and its effect upon the quality or standard of bullion.

The platina alloys are very durable. Having explained the means which I had provided for ascertaining the relative heat of a furnace, I turn to the more interesting portion of my experiments on pyrometric subjects; namely, the determination by means of an air thermometer of the absolute temperature at which pure silver enters into fusion. And here I pass over many fruitless endeavours made with cast iron retorts *, filled with azote to prevent oxidation, and proceed at once to the description of the apparatus which at last satisfied my expectations, and furnished the results presently to be enumerated. In Plate II. fig. 1. the complete apparatus is displayed at the moment of an experiment. A, represents a retort or bulb of pure gold, weighing about 6500 grains troy, and containing nearly ten cubic inches of air. B, is a tube also of pure gold, which at its outer end is firmly united by a small gold collar to a similar tube, C, of pure silver; the bore of the latter tube is larger than that of the gold; but to prevent any undue influence from the unequal heating of the air contained in them both, -and to confine the operation entirely to the gold bulb, the two tubes are plugged by wires of the same metals, so as to leave a very minute crevice for the air to pass. The out-,r part of the tube C is kept cool with a wet towel, to protect the -stopcocks and flexible tube D. The tube D completes the communication of -the air bulb with the glass reservoir E, which is intended as a substitute for an inconvenient length of N These experiments only furnished me with one fact new to myself; namely, that cast iron acquires a permanent increase of bulk by each successive heating: for the cubic contents of the retort used, as determined by the weight of pure mercury contained at the temperature of 80?, were as follows: Before the first experiment..* 9.13 cubic inches. After the first fire ....... ......... 9.64 After three fires .10.16 And the augmentation, which is more remarkable, exceeds the dilatation due to the temperature to which it was exposed; for as iron expands .0105 in 180 degrees, the increase of bulk upon 10 cubic inches should be .105 X 3 = .315 at 1800? FAHR., or near the melting point of silver: whence it may be concluded that the dilatation of iron is not equable, as has been also proved by Messrs. DULONG and PETIT. 88 MR. PRINSEP ON THE MEASUREMENT OF HIGH TEMPERATURES. graduated tube. This reservoir is nearly filled with olive oil, and is furnished with a safety tube and bulb F into which the oil rises when the air of A begins to flow, /and a stopcock below, for the purpose of restoring the equilibrium of pressure by drawing out a portion of the oil. In the collar of the reservoir E, however, there is another stopcock aperture, leading into a graduated glass tube, G. in which a small bubble of oil is made to traverse. As this tube was very accurately divided into two-hundredths of a cubic inch, and may be read off to a tenth of that quantity, the equilibrium is capable of very delicate adjustment. The furnace, as the figure exhibits, was situated in an adjoining apartment, so as to screen the exterior apparatus entirely from the heat. A small thermometer in F. however, serves to note any small change of temperature in the reservoir. The furnace and muffle need no description, being of the ordinary assay construction. p, p, p, are little pyrometer cupels containing alloys of silver and gold, as mentioned in the former part of this paper. Fig. 2. represents one of these pyrometer cupels with the lid raised, showing three of the alloys melted, and the rest retaining their form. Every part of the instrument was ultimately rendered perfectly air-tight. But the first twelve experiments were rejected on account of minute leakage, which was at length entirely overcome; and several more were excluded on the suspicion of the air withmn the bulb not being thoroughly deprived of moisture, which desideratum was at last considered to be attained after frequently replenishing it with fresh air from a mercurial gasometer, where it had been exposed for days and even weeks to the drying action of concentrated sulphuric acid. The absolute temperature, as must be evident from the construction of the instrument, is to be deduced from the measured volume of air expelled from the heated gold bulb; which volume again is to be found by the weight of the oil drawn from the reservoir, together with the adjustment of the bubble of oil in the graduated glass tube. The necessary calculation, however, embraces several corrections: some of them of minor effect and of known and certain influence,-as the formule for barometric and thermometric change; specific gravity of the oil, &c. ;-others, which affect materially the results, and are by no means so certain in their power: these are the dilatation of gold at high temperatures, and the absolute law of gaseous expansion. The close MR. PRINSEP ON THE MEASUREMENT OF HIGH TEMPERATURES. 89 agreement of M. GAY-LuSSAC's and Mr. DALTON'S expressions for the expansion of gas between the fusing and the boiling point of water (0.375 and 0.376 in 180? FAHR.) leaves, it is true, but little room for hesitation in the adoption of the term 0.375 for 180 degrees. But as the tables of the dilatation of metals only give that of gold up to the boiling point of water, I may be wrong in assuming an equable rate of increase for greater heat: and it is therefore as much to provide against alterations in these points by future experimentalists, as from an earnest desire to conceal nothing which may affect my general conclusions, that I venture to trouble the Society with a detail of the data on which the several calculations are made. By this means, too, the following tables will speak for themselves, without the necessity of continual explanation. FIRST SERIES. 1. The tubes of silver and gold not plugged. 2. The contents, or interior volume of the gold bulb and tube, were found equal to 9.989 cubic inches, at the rate of 252.397 grains of pure water to the cubic inch at 800 FAHR.: but as the minus expansion of the portion of air in the gold tube, due to its not being heated to the full heat of the bulb, was rather more than balanced by the plus expansion of the air in the silver tube, the volume is estimated at 10 cubic inches. 3.

After this accident I endeavoured to render the bulb again serviceable by patching on a new bottom with as little solder as possible. In effecting the junction, I had reason to fear that a small portion of borax got into the interior of the instrument, and injured the subsequent experiments; and, as accidents seldom come singly, I was also perplexed by a few drops of oil having oozed down the tubes into the bulb, and, being suddenly converted into permanent gas, producing an excess in the quantity of oil driven from the reservoir. In four experiments the excess was about 150 grains, and the cause vas evident during the process of cooling; but it was difficult to estimate the exact amount of new gas generated. The contents of the repaired bulb were 7.666. 92 MR. PRINSEP ON THE MEASUREMENT OF HIGH TEMPERATURES.

The longer the bulb remained in the water, the more gas came over; and when the instrument was again submitted to the furnace, the oil expelled amounted only to 1200 and 1300 grains, proving that some leakage existed which was not perceptible at a low temperature. With this experiment the whole series was brought to a conclusion. It now remains to convert the data afforded by the foregoing table into degrees of the common thermometer. A single example will suffice to explain the process of this simple though somewhat lengthy calculation: and the table No. II. which follows, will set forth the fundamental data whence the results of each experiment are deduced. One or two corrections,-for the expansion of the glass reservoir, and for the minute quantity of air contained in the exterior part of the apparatus,-are omitted in the calculation, as hardly appreciable: the temperature of the air in E (fig. 1.) may not always have been given with accuracy, as the thermometer was unavoidably suspended in F. No error on this head could exceed a single degree, as the screen wall effectually kept off the influence of the furnace, or equalized it on all objects connected with the apparatus outside. AIR.

MR. PRINSEP ON THE MEASUREMENT OF HIGH TEMPERATURES. 95 I have now brought these experiments to a conclusion, and believe that they are sufficiently trustworthy to warrant a reduction in the tabular melting point of pure silver of at least 400 degrees below the determination of Mr. DANIELL, while they indisputably prove the superiority of that gentleman's thermometric table as contrasted with that of Mr. WEDGWOOD. That the air thermometer cannot be expected to give indications perfectly accordant, those who have kept registers of the manometer of the sympiesometer will be ready to grant. At high temperatures, also, a very small difference in the quantity of air ejected produces a considerable change in the corresponding heat; and the air thermometer has the disadvantage of becoming less sensible with every increase of heat; for the portion which is expelled from the hot bulb must necessarily be cooled to a known point before it can be measured. The substitution of a reservoir of oil or mercury in the place of a mere graduated tube is essential, where the instrument is to be suddenly thrust into the fire, as the rapid motion of a bubble of liquid in a tube would either, if oil, leave it as a film lining the tube, or if mercury, break a passage for the air by the side of it. The reservoir employed by me was equal to a tube fifty feet long, and of the same bore as the adjusting tube G. To obviate the uncertainty of the increase of the bulb A, I constructed an apparatus for submitting the dilatation of gold and other metals to actual measurement: but as I have not yet concluded my experiments, I shall reserve them for a separate communication.
