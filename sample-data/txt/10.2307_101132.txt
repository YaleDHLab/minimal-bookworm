A Letter, not long since written to the Publisher by an Experienced person residing at Amsterdam, containing a true Description of Nova Zembla, together with an intimation of the advantage of its shape and position. S I R, I Herewith send you what I have received out of Muscovy, which is a New Mapp of Nova Zembla and Weigats, as it hath been discover'd by the express order of the Czar; and drawn by a Painter, called Panelapoetski, who sentitmefrom Mosco for a present: By which it appears, That Nova Zembla is not an Island, as hitherto ithath been believed to be; and that the Mare glaciale is not a Sea, but a Sinus or Bay, the waters whereof are sweet. Which is the same with what the Tartars do also assure us, who have tasted those waters in the very midst of the Sinus. The Samojeds as well as the Tartars do unanimously affirm, that passing on the back of Nova Zembla, at a considerable distance from the shore, Navigators may well pass as far as Japan. And 'tis a great fault in the English and Dutch, that seeking to get to Japan on the South-side of Nova Zembla, they have almost always passed the Weigats. The letter O in the great A 2 River AEneid. 6. v. 660. (4) River Oby marks the place of a Cataract or Fall of Waters. The letter K denotes the conjunction of Zembla with the Continent. The River marked L, runs towards China, called Kitaie: which is not every where navigable, by reason of the rocks and other inconveniences that obstruct the passing of vessels. Weigats itself is very difficult to pass, because of the great quantity of Ice, continually falling into it out of the river Oby, whereby that streight passage is stopp'd up. The Samajeds go every year a fishing upon the said sweet Sea and that on Nova Zembla's side *. Transact No.101 Nova Sembla Sinus dulcis K L Waigals Oly fluvius O
