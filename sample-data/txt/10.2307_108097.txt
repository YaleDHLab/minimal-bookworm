PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS. XII. First Memoir on the Theory of Analytical Operations. By the Rev. R. MURPHY, M.A. Fellow of Caius College, Honorary Member of various Philosophical Societies. Communicated by J. W. LUBBOCK, Esq. F.R.S. Received December 8,-Read December 22, 1836. ? 1. 1. THE elements of which every distinct analytical process is composed are three, namely, first the Subject, that is, the symbol on which a certain notified operation is to be performed; secondly, the Operation itself, represented by its own symbol; thirdly, the Result, which may be connected with the former two by the algebraic sign of equality. rrhus let a be the subject representing, we may suppose, some quantity, b the symbol for multiplication by b, and c the result or product; for greater distinctness let the subject be inclosed in square brackets, the analytical process in this case is [a] b = c. Again, let x' be the subject, 4. a symbol of operation denoting that x must be changed into x + h, and (x + h)' will evidently be the result, or [xn] A (x + h)8. Again, let ax be the subject, A a symbol of operation, which indicates that we are to subtract the subject itself from that which it becomes when x is changed into x + h, which is usually called taking the finite difference, then the result is +h A x a a, or [ax] A [ax](ah 1) Lastly, let d, denote the operation of taking the finite difference, and after dividing it by h, then putting h = 0, which is the same as finding the differential coefficient of the subject, which we may suppose represented by u, then [u] XX d 2 B MDCCCXXXVII.~~~ 2 x 180 MR. MURPHY ON THE THEORY OF ANALYTICAL OPERATIONS. 2. The operations written as above are monomial, consisting of only one term and polynonmial operations give the sums or the differences of the results of the respective ruonomials of which they are formed, according as these monomials are affected by the signs4 + or-, Thus if 1 as an operation ibe understood as the multiplying of the subject by unity which leaves it unaltered, and the symbols g, A have the same signification as in art. I1 then [u] (4i-1)= [u]A [u] (A+ Q)= [u> A, where the subject t is any quantity whatever. When general relations, such as these, between different symbols exist independ& ently of the particular value of the subject, we may abstract the consideration of the latter, and the sign between symbols of operation being understood to indicate that they are universally equivalent, the symbols used in art. 1 would have the following relations independent of the subject. A, =T ,A=A+1 A 4v-1I when h is put = 0. 3. A comnpound operation consists of a series of simple defined operations, monom"ial or polynomial, the subject of each individual in this series after the first being the result of all the preceding operations. Thus [x2] a 4, A d, denotes that first 2 must be mntvltiplied by a, which gives a -2; then the operation 4,v, which denotes the p uttitig x I h for a, gives a (x + h)2; next the operation A will give a (x + 2 h)2_ a (x + /)2, or a (2 h x + 3 h2); and lastly, the symbol of taking the differential coefficient relative to x gives 2 h a: the final or complete result is therefore X2I a 4 A dw = 2 h a. When all the symbols in a compound operation are exactly the same, then for abridgment the whole operation is represented by writing an index to the right of the symbol for the simple operation over it, this index expressing the number of times the simple operation is repeated. Thus [xg] 4,3 [x 4, ., = [(X + h)2] ( + 2 h)2] 4 (x + 3 h)2. But when the simple operations are different, they must be written consecutively in the order in which they are to be performed, unless that order of arrangement by the mutual relations of the operations should be indifferent. Thus [Xi] :1 r4 = [x +`] 4, (x + h) n + I [X "] 4, i = [(' + It)] Xv _ i (iv + p4)" MR. MURPHY ON THE THEORY OF ANALYTICAL OPERATIONS. 181 But M1as lax x =a(x +I)t E' .4 a [(x + h)] a = a (x + h)n. in the latter case the order of the operations is indifferent, because the operation 4 does not act on the multiplier a, and for the contrary reason the order of x 4 isfixed in the first case. Operations are therefore relatively fixed or free in the first case a change in the order in which they are to be performed would affect the result, in the second case it would not do so. In a compound operation any part of the symbols may be taken conjointly with the subject in the square brackets, their result being the subject for the compound operation of the remaining symbols. Thus [E2] a 4, A d, = [azl2] %4 A d ?2. 4. Linear operations in analysis are those of which the action on any subject is made up by the several actions on the parts, connected by the sign + or -, of which the subject is composed. Let p denote the operation of multiplying by a quantity p, then [a + bJp= [al p + [b] P; this operation is therefore linear. Let 4, denote the operation of changing x into x + h, then if f (x), P (x) be any functions of x, we have [f (x)+ p ()] --=f (x +h) + p(x h) [f (x)] + [p(x)] kp which shows that 4, is also a linear operation. Let X + t represent the subject acted on, and 0, 0' any linear operations, then [X+$1 (0+d) = [X+ ]d+ [X+]0 = [X] + [R + [X] 0' + RI 0' = XI (0+ ) + X (0+); hence polynomial operations of which the parts are linear possess themselves the same character. Thus A the operation of Finite Differences is linear, because A = 4-1, the operation 4, of changing x into x + h and the multiplying by unity being both linear. Also [X + e] 0 f= [X 0 + t 0] 0' [X] 0 0 + [X 0 0, which shows that the compounds of linear operations are also linear. The operation of taking the differential coefficient is therefore linear, for the opera 2nB2 182 MR. MURPHY ON THE THEORY OF ANALYTICAL OPERATIONS. tion A of finite differences and that of dividing by h being both of that character, the compound A. h is generally linear, and must remain so in the limiting state when h vanishes. Hence every function of a linear operation is itself of the same class of operations. 5. The composition of polynomial linear operations is effected in the same manner as algebraic multiplication; with, however, this peculiarity-the order of the compound operations, when not relatively free, must be strictly preserved. Thus let 0, 0 ' ,' represent linear operations: then lu] (0 + 0' ( ) = Lul (0 I + 0 ' + 0 :' + 0''); for i ' being linear will act on each of the parts [u] 0, [uJ 0, which form their subject. Again, when 0, 0' are relatively fixed, [u] (O + 0')2 will not, as in algebraic involution, be identical with [u] (02 + 2 0 0' + 012), its correct value being [uJ (0 + 0 0 + 0 0 + 012); which, however, is the same as the former expression, when 0, 0' are relatively free; for then 0' = 0 0'. Similarly (0 + 01)3 = (03 + 0' 02 + 0 0' 0 + 012 0) + (02 0+ o 0 0 + 0 012 + 013); or putting 0(2) 0' for the sum of the compound operations in which 0 twice enters, and 01 and 0,(2) for the sum of those containing 0 once and 01 twice, this may also be written (0 + 03)= 03 + 0(2) 01 + 0 01(2) + 0'3 and employing a similar notation, we shall have, when n is a positive integer, (0 + 0')" = 0() + O(n-1) 0' + 0(?-2) o(2) + 0(2) 01(n-2) + 0 1(4-1) + 01(n). The term 0(" I) 0' in this formula is the sum of n terms, formed by placing 0' at the beginning, at the end, and in all the n 2 intermediate positions of the expression o 0 0. (n -1) times. Similarly, by the known theory of permutations, 0(n-2) 01(2) is the sum of terms &c Hence when 0, 01 are relatively free, we have (O + 0')" = On -J n (in-1 fi + n (n on-'201 + 0 et-1 + Awn, 6.

(IV.) are TAYLOR'S theorems for the development of functions by means of their finite differences and their differential coefficients respectively. Again, if h be written for k in the expansion (IV.), and the subject be omitted, it becomes hk dx 1t3d3 + hdx+ + j d+, &C. (V.) and A hd +-l +p1, &c. ? 3. 7. The expansion given for the operation 4', of changing x into x + hI, possesses remarkable properties, which we propose to develop in the present section, from the importance of the theorem of TAYLOR, which it expresses. Representing, as usual, by 4' the operation of changing x into x + hI, and by 4" that of changing v into x+h', the quantities hI, h' being independent of x, and, lastly, denoting by By the operation which changes x into xv + h + h', we have obviously the identity 184 MR. MURPHY ON THE THEORY OF ANALYTICAL OPERATIONS. and putting for these symbols their expansions found in the preceding article, we get { 1+hd + C++ _+&c} {l1+h d 2+ h+ dj3i+,&c} l hd+ 1.4 1.. + &C.x1. ..S )' -1 +++ (h + hk)d +(Ajd +hkij j' +&C . a relation which may be verified by actually compounding the two polynomials of the first member. Now in this act of verification the operations h d hI' d have only such properties as are common to any two linear operations which are relatively free: hence if 0, 01 represent any such operations, we have generally {1 +0+ A.2+ y.2i,+,&c}* {1 + '+ i+ i + +,&C} _I + t?0 + i) + i(6+ 612 + ( +') I.Q-2 and it is easy to extend an identity exactly similar to any number of operations which 6712 ?,t3 are all relatively free ; for in introducing a new polynomial, I + 01 + i + 13 2 +,&c., we have only to regard 0 + 0' as itself a free linear operation, and therefore the result would be I + (0 + o+ or) + (d + 0t + yll)g,+(0 + $t + &1)3 + C 8. If the subject be a function of two variables, x and y, then using i to denote that x must be changed into x + A, and i'., that y must become y + k, these opera. tions are relatively free, it being of no consequence which operation is first performed ; therefore the operations AZ, Ay of taking the corresponding finite differences are also free; from whence, lastly, the differentiations relative to x and y, represented by di, dy, must be of the same character. Now since A 1 + h d+ h+ gi9 + had3 + &Aix =I + hdx+-ix 1 +, &C. and y = I + kdy + k2 dy2 + + &c therefore, by the general identity of (7.), we have (h d4 + k dY)2 (k d + k dy)3 54-,x lp + (hdx+ k dy)+ + &C --). And now introducing the subject f (xy), and expanding the terms in the right member of this identity by the formula given in the preceding section, it will become, in the common notation, IR.

Ha Hd ving seen in the course of the investigations of this section the signification of the indices of operations when fractional negative or even purely symbolical of linear operations, it is easy to prove by similar steps that 'in all cases where 0, 0 are relatively free, (4 + t d) = .+ n 41+L (71 p d2 10 2 _ &MR.

Suppose 0 to represent any operation which performed on a subject [u] gives y as the result, then the inverse operation is denoted by 0, and is such that when Dy] is made the subject u becomes the result. Thus b denoting the operation of multiplying by a quantity 6, we have [a] b-=c [.ec] b=a. Again, 4 denoting the operation of changing a into i + h, we have Lf (x)] + = @ (Z)where p (i) .f (iv + It) [(,v) l(t), wheref (v) ( h) RDCCcXXXV i1. 2 C 188 MR. MURPHY ON THE THEORY OF ANALYTICAL OPERATIONS. and in general if [U] -=y then [y] O=zt and therefore [y] O' 0 = y, the compound operation Ol 0 or 00 being equivalent to no operation. To invert a compound operation we must invert the order as well as the nature of the component operations, which rule must be strictly observed when the latter are relatively fixed. For let [X] =y [y] 0t = z and therefore [x] v D' z. Then [z] 0I' =y [y] = =x and. . [Z] 0-1 D-1 = a, which proof is applicable, whatever be the number of the component operations. If all the component operations be alike, we have then but to change the sign of the index to obtain the inverse, thus if [U] t' y, then [y] -n = as in the last section. 13. The consideration of inverse operations leads to the introduction of the appendage, which when the operations are linear must be annexed to the result to give it the most general value of which it is susceptible, for the inverses of such operations are themselves linear; thus if d be a linear operation, [X + ]= X]0 + [ d. Put [X] 0 = X1, [a] 0 =1 hence rX1 + a1] 0 = X + f [X1] 01 + [NJ] d-), which shows the linearity of 0 '. Noxv suppose the nature of 0 to be such that [P] 0 0, the subject P being thus in some way connected with the nature of the operation 0, then if we, suppose [X] 0 = y, we have also [X + P] d = y, hence [y] 0' X + P, this being the same as writing y + 0 for y, since [0] d1 P. The appendage therefore in a linear operation is the result of its action on zero; P will express aformn, but its magnitude must be susceptible of an infinity of values, that is, it contains arbitrary constants which enter as multipliers, for if a be such a constant, we have in general [X] a 0 = [X] 0 a; and supposing X = 0, we have [O. a] 0 = [0] 0 a: therefore whatever particular value may be assigned to [0] 0, a more comprehensive value is attained by its arbitrary multiplication by a. A multiplier is the most general form in which the operation represented by a can enter when X is a function of but one variable; but it admits of other forms more extended in cases of several variables, as may easily be perceived: thus [fy] representing a function independent of x, then [fy] By f/(y), 4', denoting the operation of changing x into a + h: hence [f (y)] A. = 0. Then if X be any function of a, and d be any particular value of [X] A 1 we shall have more generally [X] -A 1 = MR. MURPHY ON THE THEORY OF ANALYTICAL OPERATIONS. 189 which includes the former; since, the form off (y) being arbitrary, we have v alone, amongst the infinite number of values of +f (y). In compound operations, the appendage obtained by the first simple operation becomes a new subject for the succeeding operations, each of which may in like manner introduce a new appendage. 14. The operation 4iS taken directly or inversely, is incapable of introducing any appendage: for suppose [0] ?' = 9 (x), then [p (v)] 4 0, or P (xv + I) = 0, which identity being general, we may put x instead of x + h, which gives 9 (x) = 0; from which it also follows that [0] 4 7n = 0. To find the appendage introduced by d7', suppose in the same way [0] dijl = c(x), hence [I (x)] dz 0, therefore [9 (x)] dZ2 = 0 [9 (x)] dx3 = 0, &c.; and since 9(x+ h) (x) + h d x + 1. d2 + hence we have p (x + I) = (x), and h being arbitrary, we may put it = x, therefore p (x) = o (0), that is, i (x) is constant relative to x; if therefore C be any arbitrary quantity independent of x, we have [0] di,' = C. Again, [0] dS2 = [0] dx-' dz,1 = [C] dj-' + [0] dx-', as above stated; but since [C]I dZ = C, and [0] dj' = C', any constant therefore [0] dj2 = C x + C', and in general [0] d -n = A Xn-1 + As n-2 + A3XAWNS? .,.. + An, where Al A2 .. . . An denote constant multipliers. Lastly, let [0] Ax1 = (x), or [9 (x)] Ax _ 0, therefore 9 (x + h)=9 (x), and by TAYLOR'S theorem (dividing by 9 (x), 0 = p:(X)) A + 1(P (x) h12 + &c. where If (x) 9" (x) &c. are the differential coefficients of 9 (x); this identity being independent of x, the latter quantity must disappear from the series: put therefore 9 ()) , n being independent of x; hence e~~~~~~I / () l(x) =-he * (x) (X') = (x), &C therefore h ' 2C2a l 90 MR. MURPHY ON THE THEORY OF ANALYTICAL OPERATIONS. also since (x) (x + h) change x into x + h (x + h) (x + 2 h) and ?n n n/ generally @ (x) @ (x + m h), m being an integer; and since q (X) = C a ms satisfies this equation, it follows that + n + 2 n + 3 n, &c. satisfy the equation (a.), the complete appendage will therefore be nxV-i 2nxVi -n xV-I 2nx/ Al A +A2AS +.... ?B1 A h + . the number of constants being infinite. 15. When the simple operations which compose a compound one are relatively firee their places are transmutable, but when fixed a mutation of places will require an alteration in the operations themselves. Let As denote the changing of x into x + h as before, and let if be any operation affecting x, or, which is the same, fixed relative to Ax, then considering dX as a subject, put [Of] xd = d' , and if the compound operation [u] Ox Asx be proposed, its value by transmutation is [u] Ax d' , for in the first compound operation Ax affects all the preceding symbols as forming its subject. Again, let [u] dx A= y be proposed for transmutation, we have y= [u]dx(j41) [u] (.4.' d0) and putting Ax + 1 for 4's and 6x Ax for the finite difference of d considered as one operation, we have y =[u] (A d' + ox Ax) = [u] dx Ax. Lastly, divide this identity by h, and then put h = 0. When x becomes dx, and O' becomes &x, we get for the transmutation of O, dxn [u] 6x dx = [u] (d Ox + dx). These formulae of transmutation separated from the subject are respectively Air? = Ax dx AS dx x = x Ax + ox x Oxdx= dmO,+ do When Ox is constant or not dependent on x, then d' a =_ x x = 0 Ax Wx = O. and these formulae will then express merely that Ox ,xn &c. are relatively free. For example, let 0, simply denote a multiplier, then O., 4 will be Od + also a multiplier, dx Ax= + , f, which may be represented by 'd and dxa = the limit of '+ A -when h vanishes, or the differential coefficient of 0, which may be denoted by 0',C then the general formula becomes MR.

Before proceeding further in the search of the fundamental formulae for the transformation of operations, we shall exemplify the theory which precedes by inverting binomial operations and applying the results to some simple cases. Let 0, 0' denote two linear operations relatively fixed or free, and let us seek the value of (0-0') Put (0 0') 0' + t,; the latter being the difference of two linear operations must itself be linear. Hence 1 (0-1 + 41) (0-0') = 1 0f + 1 (0 -0) therefore n1 (0 0') 0 0'. Similarly put -t = 0-1 o' 0-1 + 42 which gives 41 (0-0') = 0' 0' (0' 01)2 + n (0 0') whence 42 (00') = (001)2 so again put (0-1 01)2 01 + 13 -3 (0-1 0')3 0-1 + 14 &c. = &c. We thus obtain (0 0)= 01 + (0-1 0') 0-1 + (0' 01)2 0-1 + + (0-1 o0)'-1 0-" + E, where Y7 represents the compound operation (0' O')n (0 _ 0') '. The same formula continued to infinity would be obtained by first putting 0-' (100' 0')-' for (0 0'); and since the operations represented respectively by I and 0-1 0' are relatively free, we should have by art. I 1. (i 0-1 0')' =1 + 0-1 o' + (0-1 01)2 + &c. ad infin. When 0., 0' are relatively free the theorem becomes (001)-1 = 0-1 + 0-201 + 0012 + 0-40'3 + . .. . 0-n0'n+ 0-0'i (0 0')-i. 19. For a first example suppose AZ to denote the finite difference, on the supposition that by the operation 4y the quantity x is changed into x + h. Then Aod is the finite integral, and in the usual notation of analysts is denoted by do we have therefore [f (x)] N = [f()] 1) = [f(] 1) + =f(x h) +f(x-2 h) +f (xr-3 h) +*.X +JfS(ul)h} + Ifs(x-nh); MR.

For the next example suppose the subject to be f (x 4 y), and that by the operation 4h, x receives an increment h, and y the same increment by the operation 4., then it is obvious that [f (x + y)] (4i-, 0, therefore [f (x + y)] (Ay -. ) = 0; hencef (r + y) must be included in the general value of [0] (As, 4) Now [0]1[0] {A + A, -2 A, + iAYS A 2 + a A,, + &c.} and also [0] A = p (x) an arbitrary function of a.

To return to the general theory, suppose 0, , x to represent three operations connected by the equation 0 : = i a, where the subject is omitted, the identity being supposed general; the symbol s represents an operation which may be said to be ntermediate to those designed by 0, z. If either of the extreme operations 0, z be given, and the intermediate i be also given, the other extreme may be readily found for 0 = :; X so and z = C'1 0:.s MR. MURPHY ON THE THEORY OF ANALYTICAL OPERATIONS. 197 A remarkable property of intermediate operations is that they are also intermediate between any operations which are the same functions of the extremes. For let 01X then performing the operation X 0oZ -_ X2 put now for i z its equivalent operation 0 1, and we have 02t I *21 Similarly if we suppose 0n-1 = ?then on-1 X = Ie but 1 z 0:; therefore I, = xn. Again, suppose the subject in the last equation to be one on which the operation 0' has been performed, then that equation becomes X -fn , Xn or con l>S-An. Again, suppose K an operation satisfying the equation n = i K. We have by the parts of the proof already given in this articles or 6= , K =K hence n n From these premised equations it follows, that iff (0) ! (z) represent the aggregates of any similar powers of the operations 0, z, with the same coefficients, we must have generally f (0) . I if (). By this theorem, iff (0) be known,f (z) can be found, supposing that we know i the operation intermediate to 0, z. 21. We shall now apply this theorem to cases where 0, i are given, and therefore n known, as above shown. Let one extreme 0 represent the operation of differentiating relatively to x, and the intermediate i that of multiplying by 8a", then we have d ~a X.a X U~~~~ 198 MR.

Now if O si i, it has been shown thatf (0) . s = sf (4). In this case therefore f(dx) . sax = axf (d-a) To find the intermediate operation between dx + b and dx + C; b and c not containing x. Putf (dx) = dx + b in the last identity, and b a = c we then have (dx + b) . 6(b-c)x = 6(b-c)x (dx + c) f (dx + b). f(b-c).x s(b--)xf (dx + c). 22. Suppose the intermediate operation * to denote s' P considered as a multiplie, P being a function of x, of which the differential coefficient is P, and 0 to represent dx as before, it is required to find z. Since d$ = P * therefore dx But -P 'dx xs-%p+ 6 P dx dz, -'P p?P s = (d -P)-P Hence z~~d P. Corollary; f (d * aP = Pf (dx -P).

Let * now signify the operation of changing y into y + p (x), 0 being, as before, the operation of differentiating relative to x, and the subject being a function of x and y, and 'p (x) the quantity, of which p (x) is the differential coefficient. Here s_1dx s Now r is the operation which changes y into y 'p (x), and therefore, as in dx_ dx r' . (x) i1 d.; therefore == dx _ (x), MR.

Then -f(d-F (x) dy) s 'f (d'-p (x) di) The example last given is capable of being extended to any number of variables in the subject of the operations; if that subject contain x, y, z, u, &c., and ? denote the operation of changing y into y + p (x), z into z + f (x), u into u + Q (x), &c., where 'p (x) (x) fZ (x), &c. represent any functions of x, then will s be the intermediate operation, of which d. and do p' (x) . dy ' (x) dc -2' (x) . d.-, &c. form the extremes, the accents being used to represent the differential coefficients of the functions over which they are placed. 24. Let one of the extremes, 0, be now supposed to represent the operation A. of finite differences, on the supposition that h is the increment of x. Let s represent a multiplier P., constant or variable with x. Then X M= pIAX P, But by ? 5, PX1A =$ A P-'h + PX AxP thence P + and then f (AX) . Pxf :, PX+ P Ax. L X Thus, if pa h .i Pxt += a hep1=(a -)o~ P~ .P X ah4a .a we obtain f (AX). ah = a if(a + a-l). Let i denote the operation of changing x into x + h, then As = Ax + 1, and the general formula of this article becomes f (AX) P= Pxf (4p -X Again, if the subject be a function of x and y, let s represent the operation of changing y into y + p (x) and t that which would change y into yA {ip (x)}, where Ax p (x) according to the common notation stands for p (x + I) -p (x), then by a similar procedure we shall obtain the identity f (AX) if (= -1) 25. In the identity f (Ait 7 J A _ 1 200 MR. MURPHY ON THE THEORY OF ANALYTICAL OPERATIONS. hence f(Ax) (I + b) = (1 + b)hf (Ax b). Now by the nature of an identity both sides in this expression would be alike, if expanded according to the powers of b, the coefficients of like powers must therefore be equal, and in consequence the identity must remain if b instead of being a multiplier represent any operation which is free, relative to AX, thus if b = I, I + b-= and therefore w X f(AX) . (A= f( AY) As a particular example of this, suppose the subject to be @ (y) independent of x, and f (Ax) merely to stand for A., theii [@ (my0] (AX) = O.,, the general identity therefore becomes L(,As = -0y) , o 01 [(+ k)] (Ax -AY) 0?1 k being the increment of y; now [@ (Y + W = ( + ki.j) h = ( + k $ +V) = P (y + ) which verifies the result deduced from the general identity. 26. Thus when the intermediate operation and one extreme are given the other extreme may generally be found, but it seems more difficult to discover the interme-l diate operation when both extremes are known; here follow some examples of the latter process. Let 0 represent any linear operation, dx that of taking the differential coefficient of the subject relative to x, and * the required intermediate. Then 0: = d = dx + perform on both -sides the inverse operation sol. Hence 0 d + I dxi or Suppose I = $f(Xd?) 1 +f(0d,) + {f (0 ,} &c. MR.

For a second example, suppose i the operation of changing x into x + h, A that of taking the finite difference on the same hypothesis, 0 any linear operation, then i is required to be such that ('4 0) = A :0. By art. 15, 0= LAs', + 1A Substituting we obtain To satisfy this identity, suppose ? ,v,1 = .0; now ,+ is free relative to *, hence prefix to each side the operation i4k, which only alters the subject, which is perfectly general; therefore ~= T+. 0; hence the preceding supposition fully satisfies, therefore we have this theorems, if I be determined such that 0, then shall 0)= sA 0, and f ( 0 ) I if (A O) e As a particular case, suppose 0 to be a multiplier P., then swill be another multiplier v,, such that 202 MR.

It is easy to see that this polynomial cannot contain the powers of the differential coefficients of any of the multipliers, that is such as , &c.; moreover, if we suppose v, = saJ, then de thus the order of the differential coefficients of v, in the required result will be the same as the power of the multiplier a when we substitute ga"' for v,; and the same method will apply to discover how V2 v3 &c. are involved; and when a1 a2 &c. do not enter as multipliers we thence know that V1 v2 &c. are themselves multipliers, and not their differential coefficients.

When x is changed into x + h, suppose y to become y + k, and u to be changed into u + 1.

In a memoir on the Resolution of Algebraic Equations, published in the fourth volume of the Transactions of the Cambridge Philosophical Society, I have proved the following rule. If p ()0 be an equation which contains only entire positive powers of x, and f (x) any other function of the same kind, of which the differential coefficient or derived function isf' (x), then the value off (x) will be found by taking the coefficient of in the expression-If (x) 1.. Applying this rule to the case before us we find that H is the coefficient of in the formula and consequently dY is the coefficient of in the same formula. The first (n 1) terms in the expansion of the logarithm do not contain kV and may therefore be neglected, instead then of I.{ 1-C ( t. -Y)} we may use the series I (k [ V"Y}J+4 {.
