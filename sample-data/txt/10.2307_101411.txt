An Account of Mr. Hooks Micrographia, or the Physiological descriptions of Minute Bodies, made by Magnifying Glasses. Extract of a Letter, lately written from Rome, touching the late Comet, and a New one. I Cannot enough wonder at the strange agreement of the thoughts of that acute French Gentleman, Monsieur Auzont, in the Hypothesis of the Comets motion, with mine; and particularly, at that of the Tables. I have with the same method, whereby I find the motion of this Comet, easily found the Principle of that Author's Ephemerides, which he then thought not fit to declare; and 'tis this, that this Comet moves about the Great Dog, in so great a Circle, that that portion, which is deseriC bed, (18) bed, is exceeding small in respect of the whole circumference thereof,and hardly distinguishable by us from a streight line. Concerning the New Comet you mention, I saw it on the II. of February, about the 24. deg. of Aries, with a Northern latitude of 24. deg. 40. min. The cloudy weather hath not yet permitted me to see it in Andromeda, as others affirm to have done.
