(3060) Two Observations made by P. Francesco Lana, the Author of the Prodromus premised to Arte Maestra*, concerning some of the effects of the Burning Concave of Lions; and also an odd Salt extracted out of a Metallic substance: Taken out of the same Venetian Journal. * Spoken of in Numb. 69. THe first is, That the said Fr. Lana having been inform'd, that that famous Burning Concave, not long since made by M. de Vilette, did much sooner melt Iron, than Gold or Silver; he esteems it worth considering, why a Kitchin-fire doth the contrary, melting Gold sooner than Iron? Whether it proceeds thence, that the Astral heat of the Sun is dryer than our common fire, having much humidity in it; whence Gold being moister than Iron, may more resist the dry celestial heat of the Sun, than Iron and the rest of the dryer Mettals can do? Or, Whether Gold, being of all Mettals we know of, the longest a producing and perfecting by the Solar heat, so 'tis also longest a dissolving by the same? &c. The other is, that the said P. Lana, having extracted out of a Metallic Substance a very white Salt, the same was, upon the application of the gentlest heat, resolved into a Goldencolour'd liquor; which being removed from that warmth, as soon as it felt the cool Air, and even by opening the Glass wherein it was inclosed, did in a moment shoot afresh into the same Salt;and that (which seem'd oddest) whilst he was pouring it out of one glass into another during its fluidity, it was dispersed all over the glass it was poured into, suddenly congealing into most fine threds, many of which were extended from one side of the glass to the other, and,hanging as 'twere in the Air, formed just like the subtilest Cob-webs, not at all rigid, but, by reason of their exquisite subtlety, pliable, and scarce perceivable by the Eye.
