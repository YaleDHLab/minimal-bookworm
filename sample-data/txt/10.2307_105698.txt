An Account of an Appulse of the Moon to the Planet Jupiter, observed at Chelsea, by Mr. Samuel Dunn. T H E alteration of the angles of position made by the cusps of the Moon, and a planet to which the Moon makes a near appulse, will always enable the astronomically inclined to determine from observation, the longitudes of places, by the naked eye and a clock or watch set to apparent or equal time.-Such an observation I made at Chelsea 25th Dec. 1762 at 11h 0~ 30~ apparent time, the satellites being as in the figure at the same time. Jupiter's distance from the Moon half a degree. T A B. II. Read Feb. 17, 1763. Lat. 51~ 29~ 5~, Long. 41~ West of Greenwich. X. A Cata
