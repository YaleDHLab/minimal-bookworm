V. Part of a Letter from the late Sir Philip Skippon, Kt, to the late Reverend Mr John Ray, concerning the Bones of a Humane Faetus voided thro' an Impostume in the Groin. Communicated to the Publisher, by Mr Samuel Dale. London, January 22. 1662. YEsterday in the Afternnon my Cozen Horsnel and my self visited a Woman 66 years old, in Drurylane, who had a Child ~ in her Vterus about 28 years ago; She bore two Children after this, one lived 11 years, and the other 6, About 8 years age an Impostnme broke out in the Right Inguen, and then several Bones of a Dead Child were expell'd, (some of them I have by me.) She hath a great Swelling now in that <inferred>Groin</inferred>, where the feels somewhat very hard, which she ~ are bones. I took a particular account of all Circumstances; but this is proportionable to the narrow extent of a Letter, and indeed is the substance of all.
