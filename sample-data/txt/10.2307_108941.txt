[ 97 ] VI. Addition to the Memoir on TSCH1IRN1HAUSEN'S Transformation. BY ARTHUR CAYLEY, FIR.S. Received October 24,-Read December 7, 1866. IN the memoir "On TscivRNHAUSEN'STransformation," Philosophical Transactions, vol. clii. (1862) pp. 561-568, I considered the case of a quartic equation: viz. it was shown that the equation ~~~(a, bs c,'d}, elx 1)4=-0 is, by the substitution 11 (ax+b)B+(ax2+ 4bx+ 3c)C + (aX3 + 4bx2+Gcx+ 3)D transformed into (1, o0 C, i , ((y, 1)4=O where (C, ,13 () have certain given values. It was further remarked that (C, X, C) were expressible in terms of U', H', V, invariants of the two forms (a, b, c, d, e(X, Y)4, (B, C, DI(Y, -X)2, of I, J, the invariants of the first, and of 0', =BD-C2, the invariant of the second of these two forms,-viz. that we have C =6H'.-2I1', = IU'3 3H'2 + 12812+ 12J0U'1+2IF0UH'. And by means of these I obtained an expression for the quadrinvariant of the form (11 05 el Ad yl 1) 4 viz. this was found to be _ IU'2 + 4-I2E'2 + 12J8'U'. But I did not obtain an expression for the cubinvariant of the same function: such expression, it was remarked, would contain the square of the invariant (V; it was probable that there existed an identical equation, JU"IU'2H? +4H'3+M?=J2 which would serve to express (V2 in terms of the other invariants; but, assuming that such an equation existed, the form of the factor M remained to be ascertained; and until this was done, the expression for the cubinvariant could not be obtained in its most simple form. I have recently verified the existence of the identical equation just referred to, and have obtained the expression for the factor M; and with the assistance of this identical equation I have obtained the expression for the cubinvariant of the form MDCCCEYvI. P 98 PROFESSOR CAYLEY ON TSCHIIRNHAUSEN'S TRANSFORMATION. The expression for the quadrinvariant was, as already mentioned, given in the former memoir: I find that the two invariants are in fact the invariants of a certain linear function of U, H; viz. the linear function is =U'U+20%?'H; so that, denoting by I*, j*, the quadrinvariant and the cubinvariant respectively of the form .(11 , ?, I (Ey, l) we have IJ=I(U'U +40'H), J=J(U'U+4?'H), where I, J signify the functional operations of forming the two invariants respectively. The function (1, 0, ), X, y 1)4, obtained by the application of TsCHIRNHAUSEN'S transformation to the equation (a, b, el d, epic, 140 has thus the same invariants with the function U'U+4O'H==U'(a, b, c, d, eXx, i)4+4&'(acb62, ad-be, ae+2bd-3c2, be-cd, ce-d2x, 1)', and it is consequently a linear transformation of the last-mentioned function; so that the application of TSCHIRNHAUSEN'S transformation to the equation U=O gives an equation linearly transformable into, and thus virtually equivalent to, the equation U'U+4?'lH= O0 which is an equation involving the single parameter Vu-: this appears to me a result of considerable interest. It is to be remarked that TScdIRNHAUSEN'S transformation, wherein y is put equal to a rational and integral function of the order n-I (if n be the order of the equation in x), is not really less general than the transformation wherein V y is put equal to any rational function w whatever of x; such rational function may, in fact, by means of the given equation in x, be reduced to a rational and integral function of the order n-1; hence in the present case, taking V, W to be respectively of the order n-1, =3, it follows that the equation in y obtained by the elimination of x from the equations (a, b, el do eta, 1)4= O (ce, en , V)a, 1)W is a mere linear transformation of the equation AU+BH=0, where A, B are functions (not as yet calculated) of (a, b, c, d, e, a, PI, y, A1 ce, ', y', i, ').

It is only ~necessary to show that we have such an equation, M being an invariant, PROFESSOR CAYLEY ON TSCIIIRNHAIUSEN'S TRANSFORMATION. 99 in the particular case a=e=l, b-dd=O, c=0, that is for the quartic function (1, 0, 0, 0, 15) 1) ; for, this being so, the equation will be true in general. iting the equation in the form _M0' = U'2(JU' MI) + 4H'3 + (Df2j and observing that we have U' =(B2+D2)+20BD+40 C2 Hl=d(B2+D2)+ (1 +02)BD-402C2 O'=BD-C2, (D= (I 902)C(B2-D2), 1=1+302, and thence JU' 1H1= 40 (B2+1D2)+( 1-202_ 5d4)BD+(802 + 804)C2 the equation becomes -(DC2)M= { 4d3(B2+D2)+(-1 2_2-504)BD+(802+804)C2} x {B2+D2+2dBD+40C2}2 +4 {0(B2+D2) + (1 + 02)BD402C2}3 +(1I-_9d2)2 C2{(B2+1D2)2-4B2D2} 2. It is found by developing that the right-hand side is in fact divisible by BD-C2 and that the quotient is = (-.1+ 1002-9_4)(B2+D2)2 +(80+1603-24d0)(B2+D2)BD +(4+802+404-1606)B2D2 +(-6403-19205)(B2+D2)C2 +(16022-4160411206)BDC2 +(-12804+12806)C4. 3. This is found to be =I2U'2+12JUI'H'+4H12 8IJU'10 16 J2()12 which is consequently the value of -M. We have therefore -qY2= JUI:3IU':2f+4H'3 +(PU'2 12JU'H'-41HH'2)0' + 8IJU'o'2 +4l6J2er3, -which is the required identical equation. 100 PROFESSOR CAYLEY ON TSCHIRNHAIUSEN'S TRANSFORMATION.
