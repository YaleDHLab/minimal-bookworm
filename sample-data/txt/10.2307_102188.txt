Fig. 4. ~ D ~ ~ ~ A B ~ ~ E A E ~ F ~ C C C D [1231] The Solutions of three Chorographic Problems, by a Member of the Philosophical Society of Oxford. T H E three following Problems may occur at Sea, in finding the distance and position of Rocks, Sands, &c. from the shore; or in surveying the Sea Coast; when only two objects whose distance from each other is known, can be seen at one station: but especially they may be useful to one, that would make a Map of a Countrey by a Series of Triangles derived from one or more measured Bases; which is the most exact way of finding the bearing and distance of places from each other, and thence their true Longitude and Latitude; and may consequently occur to one that would in that manner measure a Degree on the Earth. The First Problem (Fig. 1. and 2.) There are two objects B and C, whose distance B C is known, and there are two stations at A & E, where the objects B, C being visible, &the stations one from another, the Angles B A C, B A E, A E B, A E C, are known by Observation, (which may be made with an ordinary Surveying Semicircle, or Crostaff, or if the objects be beyond the view of the naked Ey, with a Telescopic Quadrant) to find the distances or lines AB, AC, AE, EC. Construction. In each of the triangles B A E, C A E, two angles at A, E, being known, the third is also known: then take any line ~ ~ at pleasure, on which constitute the triangles ~ ~ ~, ~ ~ ~ respectively equiangular to the triangles B A E, A E C; join ~ ~. Then upon B C constitnte the triangles B C A, B C E equiangular to the corresponP p p dent [1232] dent triangles ~ ~ ~, ~ ~ ~, join A E, and the thing is manifestly done. The Calculation. Assuming ~ ~ of any number of parts, in the triangles ~ ~ ~, ~ ~ ~, the angles being given, the sides ~ ~, ~ ~, ~ ~, ~ ~ may be found by Trigonometry: then in the Triangle ~ ~ ~, having the angle ~ ~ ~, and the legs ~ ~, ~ ~, we may find ~ ~. Then ~ ~. B C ~ ~ ~. B A ~ ~ ~. B E ~ ~ ~. C A ~ ~ ~. C E. The second Problem (Fig. 3 & 4.) Three objects B, C, D, are given, or (which is the same) the sides, and consequently angles of the triangle B C D are given; also there are 2 points or stations A, E, such, that at A may be seen the three points B, C, E, but not D; and at the station, E, may be seen A, C, D, but not B, that is the angles B A C, B A E, A E C, A E D, (and consequently E A C, A E C,) are known by observation: to find the lines A B, A C, A E, E C, E D. Construction. Take any line ~ ~ at pleasure, and at its extremitys make the angles ~ ~ ~, ~ ~ ~, ~ ~ ~, ~ ~ ~, equal to the correspondent observed anglesE A C, E A B, A E C, A E D. Produce ~ ~, ~ ~, til they meet in ~, join ~ ~; then upon C B describe (according to 33. 3. Eucl) a Segment of a circle, that may contain an angle = ~ ~ ~; and upon C D describe a Segment of a circle capable of an angle = ~ ~ ~; suppose F the common section of these 2 circles; join F B, F C, F D; then from the point C, draw forth the lines C A, C E, so that the angle FCA may be = ~ ~ ~, and F C E = ~ ~ ~; so A, E, the common sections of C A, C E, with F B, F D, will be the points required, from whence the rest is easily deduced. The Calculation. Assuming ~~ of any number, in the triangles ~ ~ ~, ~ ~ ~, all the angles being given, with the side ~ ~ assum'd, [1233] sum'd, the sides ~ ~, ~ ~, ~ ~, ~ ~, wil be known; then in the triangle ~ ~ ~, the angle ~ ~ ~ with the legs ~ ~, ~ ~ being known, the angles ~ ~ ~, ~ ~ ~ with the side ~ ~ will be known: then as for the rest of the work in the other figure, the triangle B C D having all its sides and angles known, and the angles B F C, B F D, being equal to the found ~ ~ ~, ~ ~ ~; how to find F B, F C, F D by Calculation (and also Protraction) has been shewn by Mr Collins (in Phil. Transact n. 69 p. 2093.) as to all its cases, which may therefore supersede my shewing any other way. But here it must be noted, that if the sum of the observed angles, B A E, A E D, is 180 degrees: then A B and E D cannot meet, because they are parallel, and consequently the given solution cannot take place; for which reason I here subjoin another. Another Solution. Upon B C (Fig. 5.) describe a segment B A C of a circle, so that the angle of the segment, may be equal to the observed ~ ~ ~ ~, (which as above quoted is shewn 33. 3. Euclid) and upon C D describe a segment C E D of a circle, capable of an angle equal to the observed C E D; from C draw the diameters of these circles C G, C H; then upon C G describe a segment of a circle G F C, capable of an angle equal to the observed ~ A E C; likewise upon C H describe a circles segment C F H, capable of an angle equal to the 'observed C A E: suppose F the common section of the two last circles H F C, G F C, join F H, cutting the circle H E C in E, join also F G, cutting the circle G A C in A: I say that A, E, are the points required. Dem: For the ~ B A C is = ~ ~ ~ by construction of the segment, also the angles C E H, C A G, are right, because each exists in a semicircle: therefore a circle being described upon C F as a diameter, wil pass thro E, A; ThereP p p 2 fore [1234] fore the angle C A E= ~ C F E=C F H= (by construction) to the observed angle ~ ~ ~. In like manner the ~ C E A= C F A=C F G= observ'd angle ~ ~ ~. If the stations A, E fall in a right line with the point C; the lines G A, H E being parallel, cannot meet: but in this case the problem is indeterminate and capable of infinite Solutions. For as before upon C G describe a Segment of a circle capable of the observed ~ ~ ~ ~, and upon C H, describe a Segment capable of the observed ~ ~ ~: then thro C, draw a line any way cutting the circles in A, E, these points wil answer the question. The Third Problem. Four points B, C, D, F, (Fig. 6.) or the 4 sides of a quadrilateral, with the angles comprehended are given; also there are 2 stations A and E such, that at A, only B, C, E are visible, and at E only A, D, F, that is, the angles B A C, B A E, A E D, D E F are given: to find the places of the two points A, E; and consequently, the lengths of the lines A B, A C, A E, E D, E F. Construction. Upon B C (by 33. 3.Eucl.) describe a segment of a circle, that may contain an angle equal to the observed angle B A C, then from C draw the chord C M, or a line cutting the circle in M, so that the angle B C M may be equal to the supplement of the observed angle B A E, i. e. its residue to 180 degrees. In like manner on D F describe a segment of a circle, capable of an angle equal to the observ'd D E F, and from D draw the chord D N, so that the angle F D N may be equal to the supplement of the observ'd angle A E F, join M N, cutting the 2 circles in A, E: I say A, E, are the two points requir'd. Dem: Join A B, A C, E D, E F, then is the ~ M A B = ~ B C M (by 21. 3. Eucl:) = supplement of the observ'd ~ B A E by construction, therefore the constructed ~ B A E [1235] ~ B A E is equal to that which was observed. Also the ~ B A C of the segment, is by construction of the Segment, equal to the observ'd ~ B A C. In like manner the constructed angles A E F, and D E F, are equal to the correspondent observed angles A E F, D E F, therefore A, E are the points required. The Calculation. In the Triangle B C M, the ~ B C M (= supplement of B A E) and ~ B M C (= B A C) are given, with the side B C; thence M C may be found; in like manner. D N in the ~ D N F may be found. But the ~ M C D)= B C D --B C M) is known with its legs M C, C D, therefore its base M D, and ~ M D C may be known. Therefore the ~ M D N (= C D F--C D M--F D N) is known, with its legs M D, D N; thence M N with the angles D M N, D N M, will be known. Then the ~ C M A (=~ D M C + D M N) is known, with the ~ M A C (= M A B + B A C) and M C before found; therefore M A and A C wil be known. In like manner in the triangle E D N. the angles E, N, with the side D N being known, the sides E N, E D will be known; therefore A E (= M N -M A--E N) is known. Also in the triangle A B C, the ~ A with its sides B C, C A being known, the side A B will be known, with the ~ B C A; so in the triangle E F D, the ~ E with the sides, E D, D F being known, E F wil be found, with the ~ E D F. Lastly in the triangle A C D, the ~ A C D (=B C D--B C A) with its legs A C, CD being known, the side A D wil be known, and in like manner EC in the triangle E D C. Note that, in this problem, as also in the first and second, if the two stations fall in a right line with either of the given objects: the locus of A, or E, being a circle, the particular point of A, or E, cannot be determined from the things given. As to the other cases of this third problem, wherein A, and E, may shift places, i. e. only D, F, E may be viP p p 3 sible [1236] sible at A, and only A, B, C at E; or wherein B, D, E, may be visible at A, and only C, F, A, at E; or wherein A may be of one side of the quadrilateral, and E on the other; or one of the stations within the quadrilateral, and the other without it: I shall for brevitys sake omit the figures, and diversity of the Signs + and -in the calculation, and presume that the Surveyour wil easily direct himself in those cases, by what has been said. The Solution of this third problem is general, and serves also for both the precedent. For suppose C, D the same point in the last figure, and it gives the solution of the second problem: but if B, C, be suppos'd the same points with D, F, by proceeding as in the last, you may directly solve the first problem.
