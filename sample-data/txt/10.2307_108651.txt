47 ] IV. Supplementary Researches on the Partition of Numbers. By ARTHUR CAYLEY, Esq., F.B.S. Received Mlarch 19,-Read June 18, 1857. THE general formula given at the conclusion of my memoir, " Researches on the Partition of Numbers*," is somewhat different from the corresponding formula of Professor SYLVESTERf, and leads more directly to the actual expression for the number of partitions, in the form made use of in my memoir; to complete my former researches, I propose to explain the mode of obtaining from the formula the expression for the number of partitions. The formula referred to is as follows, viz. if fZ be a rational fraction, the denominator ftc of which is made up of factors (the same or different) of the form I_x, and if a is a divisor of one or more of the indices m, and k is the number of indices of which it is a divisor, then {fl X.,l l)(lgS-ls.

The index s extends from s= to s=k; and we have then the portion of the fraction depending on the denominator [1-xe]. In the partition of numbers, we have Ax=:1, and the formula becomes therefore {fw} [1 any*+H(S) (x'6@) S , where X=coeff. in ts-1 T-* Philosophical Transactions, t. cxlvi. p. 127 (1856). t Professor SYLVESTER's researches are published in the Quarterly Mathematical Journal, t. i. p. 1419 there are some numerical errors in his value of P (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6) q. 48 MR. A. CAYLEY ON TUE PARTITION OF NUMBERS. We may write fx=H(1m), where m has a given series of values the same or different. The indices not divisible by a may be represented by n, the other indices by ap, we have then fXb II(1 X )jj(ja), where the number of indices ap is equal to k. Hence f (cent) _I1-re-n1)II(j gape -apt); or since g is a root of [1 -xa] =0, and therefore a= 1, we have fi(ge-1) =etlbne")~ -e11PI); and it may be remarked that if n v (mod. a), where v<a, then instead Of n we may write ?", a change which may be made at once, or at the end of the process of development. We have consequently to find X=coeff. in tSnA) The development of a factor I ee is at once deduced from that of cet and is a series of positive powers of t. The development of a factor 1 -_..apt is deduced from that of 1_e~t' and contains a term involving to Hence we have 1I (1-ge-nt)H(1eaP) = A-k tk+A-(kI) tkl* +A-4+Ao+ &c., and thence The. actual development, when k is small (for instance k= 1 or k= 2), is most readily obtained by developing each factor separately and taking the product. To do this we have ll~~t+C+C~~~it2, C?C+3t3+&Clce-t-c (-)!2t+(I-C)3t2_ _1C )4C63& where by a general theorem for the expansion of any function of et, the coefficient of tf is (_)f 1 =-If 1-c(1 +A) ( -)f I__ __ __ __ __ Hlf (1-C+(I-C)2A* +(I-C)te Of (where as usual AOf'lf-Of, A20f= 2f-2 .1f+0, &c.) and 1 -e-tt +2+12 720 t3+30240 t5-&c., where, except the constant term, the series contains odd powers only and the coefficient of t2f-I is ( BB22f; B, denoting the series 653042... of BERNOULLI'S numbers. MR. A. CAYLEY -ON THE PARTITION OF NUMBERS. 49 But when k is larger,. it is convenient to obtain the development of the fraction from that of the logarithm, the logarithm of the fraction being equal to the sum of the logarithms of the simple factors, and these being found by means of the formulae 1ac ? cC 1 t+ C t2C+c2 6+ c+4c2+ t4 lo 1Ce 1 -C (I-O) 2 (1c)36+ (i) ,-+ c log 1 -log t+it-it2+ 1 V 1 t6+ &c. 1 -et 2 24 2880 181440 The fraction is thus expressed in the form 1 1 eklt+k2t2+ .J (j1 gn) u (ap) tke and by developing the exponential we obtain, as before, the series commencing with 1 Ak _ Resuming now the formula which gives Xg as a function of A, we have [1_X] S g ; but this equation gives and we have [1 .-xl(x f)(X.~.a2) _gat if 1, a2, ... a,, are the integers lessthan a and prime to it (a is of course the degree of [1 _Xa]). Hence xgOlIn ( 1 g) and therefore or putting for yg its value d8;w =_ga 6ajI0t-)A_0 where oa is the degree of [1 -xa] and ai denotes in succession the integers (exclusive of unity) less than a and prime to it. The function on the right-hand, by means of the equation [1-ga]=O, may be reduced to an integral function of ? of the degree M-1, and then by simply changing gf into x we have the required function dOx. The fraction [1 kxa can then by multiplication of the terms by the proper factor be reduced to a fraction with the denominator 1-xaf and the coefficients of the numerator of this fraction are the coefficients of the corresponding prime circulator ( )pcr a,. Thus, let it be required to find the terms depending on the denominator [1-x3J3 in 1 MDcCcLYIII. H 50 MR. A.
