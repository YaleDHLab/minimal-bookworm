An Account of two Monstrous Births, not long since produced in Devonshire; communicated by M. Colepresse. 1. One Robert Cloak a Joyner (whom I know) of Clamick in the Parish of Beer-Ferris in Devonshire, had on Febr. 24. last, a Monstrous black Ram-Lamb fallen with one Head, but two distinct Bodies, with eight Legs; which Bodies were joyned in the Neck: It had two Eyes, and as many Ears, in the usual places; and one extraordinary Eye in the Niddock, with one single Ear, about an inch distant from the Eye backwards: Its Dame, which was White, usually brought forth two Lambs every year, as she did this year also a White one,which with the Ewe remains alive. But whether this Monster was produc'd dead or alive, is not known, it being found dead by the hedge, and soon after put into the Earth. There were ten White Ews accompanied with three White Rams. 2. One John Cauce, Servant to Mr. William Knighton of Lockridge, likewise in Beer Ferris; had among his Sheep, on the seventeenth of Febr. last, a White Lamb faln on a Common in the said Parish, with two distinct heads and Necks, Joyned at the Shoulders (481) shoulders, but one only Body, and that well form'd, yet having double entrals in all respects. The Ewe remains well. The Monster dyed, and is now in my Custody, after it hath been dried in an Oven, and By the Sun.
