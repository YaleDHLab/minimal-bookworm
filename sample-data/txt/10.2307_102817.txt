(843) III. An Account of Mr Sam. Brown, his Third Book of East India Plants, with their Names, Vertues, Description, &c. By James Petiver, Apothecary, and Fellow of the Royal Society. To which are added some Animals sent him from those Parts. THese were gathered between the 22th and 27th of March, 1696. at Chamberamback and Aumerampead, 14 or 16 miles from Fort St George: Dry ground generally, and good soil. At this Place is a Pond 12 miles round. 93. Tetum-cootan Malabar. 93 Lycium Chamberambacum Laurifoliis floribus comosis. An Kanden Kara Hort. Malab. Vol. 5. Tab. 36. Pag. 71 Raii Hist.

The Fruit sowre, and big as a Hazel-nut. A Decoction of the Root, Leaves, Flowers, Bark and Fruit, or 3 spoonfuls of the Juice of them taken night and morning Cures Running of the Reins and Sharpness of Urine. S. B. 96. Tauneekia Malab.

This grows about 8 or 10 foot high, and 6 or 7 inches diameter. The Fruit purges Choler: The Rcot, Bark and Leaves boyl'd in Water and drank purges Phlegm; and these mixt with other things serve to cure almost all Distempers, according to the Doctrine of the Natives. S. B. The World is very much obliged to Mr Sam. Brown for the certain knowledge of this Tree, which has hitherto lain in Obscurity, we having until now only seen the Fruit in the Shops. 97. Cadal-Cungee Malab 97 Pimienta Chamberambaca Myrti Laureae foliis fructu coronato. This grows 6 or 7 foot high, and as thick as ones arm. The whole Plant, ground either with Milk, Tire or hot Water (845) Water cures the Diabetes: it seldom fails. This sort is the best for Physick of all the 4 Cungees. S. B. Mr Edward Bulkley Surgeon informs me, that a Decoction of this drank twice a day is good in the Gout and pains of the Side. This differs from the Baccifera Madraspatana Myri Laureae foliis vix perforatis Mus. Petiver. 361. & Act. Phil.

The Flowers of this are yellowish in my Specimens, and not of a deep Purple, as Dr Plukenet affirms, but the Calyces when full ripe are so, which I suppose may be those the Dr calls Flowers. Dr Herman first sent me this from Ceylon, I have since receiv'd it from Viriaga patan, among those Mr Wynn Surgeon brought me. I have also had it out of the Company's Garden at Fort St George, and wild from several places thereabout, but as yet I have not seen it from any part of Africa, much less from the Cape of Good Hope, from whence Dr Plukenet says he had it. It grows 8 or 9 foot high, thick as a Mans Arm. The Root, Bark and Leaves, either in Powder or Decoction, cures lingring or Hectick Fevers, or as these people express it, a Fever in the Bones. It's of kin to No 50. S. B. It may be soin Vertue as a Pectoral, but not in kind that being an Apocynum. 99. Sirrunar-vellee Malab. 99 Sebestenae folio Frutex, Foribus racemosis.

The Root is Milky, but the Natives here, so far as I can yet learn, use it not. The other two are call'd Corute and PerenCorutte. S. B. Dr Plukenet makes this the true Cydonia e Benghala Acostae Phytograph. Tab. 170. fig. 5.

It's here call'd by the Portuguese Marmel da India, or Indian. Quince Tree, and is the same, I believe, with Garcias (849) cias his Cydonia de Bengala. 'Tis about 16 or 18 foot high, and about 8 or 10 inches diameter. A Decoction of the Leaves is a Counter-poyson of the Root, purifies the Blood and corrects Choler, as the Natives phrase it: but the Fruit decocted is a Panacea in all Fluxes and Fevers. S. B.

I first received the Cydonia de Bengala Garciae, &c. from that most accurate Botanist Jacobus Breynius at Dantzick, sent him by Dr Herman from Zeylon; from which Island I have since had it from other hands. My ingenious Friend Mr James Cuninghame Surgeon observed it about Batavia (where Bontius also did) and says the Javians call it now Malliac; and before that he brought it me from Bengale by the name of Beel, which has some affinity with what Garcias says, viz. that in Bengale it's call'd by the Physicians only, and in their Writings Beli, but by others it's commonly known by the name of Sirifole. He also confirms what Mr Sam. Brown and the Hort. Malab. asserts, viz. that the Fruit cures Diarrhea's and Fluxes. 109. Care-vail-maraum Malab. I take the Malabar-word Care or Cara to signifie Black (as Care Nucheel, or Black Agnus Castus, Act. Phil. No 244. p. 319. N. 12. and confirm'd hereafter at No 121) and is, I suppose, added here to distinguish it from another species, whose Bark is red. Act. Ph. No 244. p. 319. Pl. 12. This, I think, is the Acacia, or AEgyptian thorn, it grows 15 or 16 foot high, and about 7 or 8 inches diameter, tho I have seen it much greater up the Country. A strong Decoction of the Bark of this Tree, by washing the Teeth and (850) and holding it int he mouth, cures the most rebellious Tooth-ach, as I have often experienced. The Decoction of the Root cures Fluxes: The Natives use not the Fruit, but I have made an Extract of it, of excellent use in Fluxes, and is also good in the Diabetes. S. B.

Veslingius observes them to vary very much in their length, viz. from an inch to more than a span long, and from 3 or 4 to 8 or 10 divisions like a Necklace. This before us has xi, with one dark flattish circled seed in each. Parkinson's Figure p. 1548. taken from Veslingius is very like this Plant, and particularly the pod which he has mended, and added to it. Park. 1548. 2. 110.

The Natives cut this Root in pieces about 2 inches long, the better to take off the Bark, Garc. 145 cap. 36: (851) Bark, which they put into a clean Cloath, between two Earthen Pots unglazed which shut close, the undermost being ~ full of Milk, which they boyl almost all away, that the vapour may penetrate the said Bark, which afterwards they dry in the Sun and powder it; a dram of this is a very gentle but brisk Purge, and does not gripe in the least; mixt with other things it serves them for many Distempers.

Mr Edward Bulkley tells me, a Decoction of the Leaves and Bark of this Tree being drank is good for pains in the Belly, and confirms the making of Ropes and Cables of the latter for their Country Ships. These Leaves are lesser, stiffer and more veiny than the other kinds are whitish and somewhat soft underneath; the Pods are often crooked, about an inch broad, and some of them more than a span long. 118.

Aumacarun calunga Malab. 127 Alkakengi foliis mollibus fructu Asparagi. Grows about 4 foot high, has a tuberous Root as thick as ones Wrist, but very short: Which ground with Lime juice and applied cures Imposihumes, the powder of the Root cures Hectick Feavers, &c. the Fruit provokes Urine. S. B. Dr Plukenet makes this the Solanum somniferum vertieillatum CB. 167. and says it's the Pe-Vetti Hort. Malab. Vol. 4. Tab. 55. p. 113. Ray H. Pl. 1630. Whereas the Commentator Dr Commelin rather supposes it to be the Solanum somniferum, Antiquorum Prosp. Alpin. p. 71. but I cannot think the Pe Vetti either of them, because that is a Tree, and this before us is an Herb: Besides, its Figure and Description differs from this in many particulars. There are 2 of this kind in the 10th Volume of the Hort. Malab. which it rather resembles, viz. Tab. 70 & 71. 128. (856) 128.

Tab. 9. and 10. p. 17. This differs from No 117. in having thinner and less veiny Leaves, the Pods also much smaller, strait and soft, about half an inch broad, and little more than 3 long, in shape resembling the Pride of Barbadoes, but flatter. 129.

Dr Plukenet in his Mantissa, p. 140. very arrogantly blames Dr Sloan for making this Plant two of his, and and says it's his wonted Custom: It were to be wish'd, this modest Author did know his own Plants better, he would then give Dr Sloan and others less occasion for these just and frequent Reflections. I have received this Plant from Guinea, and several times from the East Indies, and find it to be the same with Dr Sloan's from Jamaica, and both Dr Plukenet's, which he was formerly so kind to shew me. This eat with Rice, cures the Gonorrhea. S. B. 130. Cauta cuddee Malab. Coccifera Chamberambaca Cassiae fistulae minoris folio, fructu Reniformi. 130 Had (857) Had that accurate Botanist Dr Plukenet but known the Fruit of the Cocculus Indiae, he would not have thus erroneously attested this to be it, and at the same time to affirm the Natsjatam Hort. Malab. Vol. 7. Tab. 1. p. 1. to be very different from the Cocculi Indorum, whereas that it is the same, the Hort. Malab. not only positively asserts, but I can prove it by Specimens I have to shew of its Leaves and Fruit, which Mr Edward Bulkley sent me from those parts. H.M.V.7. Tab.1.p.1 This is a Climer, and being ground and mixt with Water, makes it ropey like whites of Eggs and clammy, which drank cures the Running of the Reins, 3 spoonfuls a Dose. S. B. Pray take notice, that this Quality and Vertue is meant of the Plant before us, and not of the Coculus Indiae of the Shops, as the Doctor has unhappily attested, that being a known intoxicating Poyson: I therefore caution all people to beware of what this Physician has asserted in his pretended Correct Mantissa, p. 52.

This is Mungo of Parkinson and Garcias, and is a cooling refreshing Diet; the Moors call it Mungo, and I believe (858) believe that which Parkinson says is kin to it, is that the Moors call Tour, which they say is hot, and therefore give it for such as hot diet is proper. Both these shake you. S. B. 133. Chata-maraum Malab. 133 Waga Madraspat. Minosae foliis pinnatis, siliquis maximis compressis, Mus. Petiver. 698. Mus.Petiv. 698.

We are obliged to Dr Plukenet for informing us, that this Plant bears a spike of hexapetalous Flowers, since which that part is lost, and here is now only remaining its Grassy Leaves. 136. Paule-maraum Malab. Patsjotti Zeylanica Lauro136 cerasi folio, leviter serrato. This grows 6 or 7 foot high, and thick as ones Leg; the Fruit is good for Consumptions and hectic Feavers, is a little laxative; the Decoction of the Root and Bark is good for the same. S. B. This is the same with No 98. aforegoing. 137. Calle relle Malab. 137 Ficus Chamberambaca Ponnae foliis, fructu parvo gemino. Grows about 6 foot high, and sometimes as thick as a mans Leg. The whole Plant in powder 3i. taken in hot Water cures internal ulcerated Piles,and is good in Ulcers of the Intestines. S. B. This chiefly differs from No 123 in having its Fruit grow by pairs without Footstalks, and the Leaves thicker and more veiny. (859) To these we add the following Animals, which our Ingenious Friend Mr Edward Bulkley, Surgeon, lately sent me from Fort St George. 1. MUsculus Madraspat. fluviatilis, medius intus argenteus. 1 The largest of these I have yet seen, exceed not an inch in breadth, and not quite 1 1/2 in length; amongst them I have observed a gradual decrease to about 1/2 the bigness. The Shells are indifferent thick, of a dark brown on the outside, and silver within. 2. Unicornu an Fluviatilis,minor Madraspat. lineis fuscis undatis. 2 This Shell runs very taper,and has about 10 twirls, the uppermost circled with many fine striae, strip'd with brown curl'd lines, the lower twirls seem cancellated or lattic'd, I have seen of these from near an inch to an inch and half long. The Mouth 1/2 inch wide, and one long, oval without fissure. 3. Rhombus Madraspat. ex albo flavoq; mixtus, guttulis croceis circumscriptis. The Catterpillar. 3 an Rhombus gravis rostro strictiore, striis punctatis circularibus exasperatis List. Histor. Conchylior. lib. 4. Sect. 10. Tab. 744. Fig. 34. List. Hist. Conchyl. lib: 4. Sect. 4. Tab. 744. Fig. 34. This is a very elegant Shell, and the largest I have yet seen was with the Reverend Mr Stonestreet, which was about the bigness of Dr Lister's Figure. 4. Rhomboides Madraspatan. ex rufo alboq; mixtus, lineis circularibus catenatis. an Rhombus cylindro pyramidali tenuis & lineis intersectis circumscriptis, clavicula acuta List. Hist. Conchyl. Lib.4.

Mr Roche first brought me this from Maurice his Island (which Seamen commonly call the Morushias,) since which Mr Edward Bulkley sent it me with the aforegoing from Fort St George. 11. Folliculena seu Folliculum Phalenae, ovale, appendice annulo terminante e Madraspatan. 11 This is a wonderful Insect-Case or Coffin, form'd by some sort of Silk or Cobweb-spinning Catterpillar, but the Moth from whence it comes I cannot yet learn: Its peculiarity, which I have not observed in any other, is a pedicle with a Ring at the end of it, thro which this oval Case is fastned to the Branches and Twigs of Trees, Shrubs, &c. 12. Capricornus Madraspatanus major, humero cornibusque spinosis. This 12 (861) This Goat-cheffer is 2 inches and 1/2 long, and near one broad; on each side his Shoulder is a spine; his Vaginae or Sheath-wings near this part are sprinkled with little eminencies: the Horns about 3 inches long, composed of 10 thorny geniculae. 13. Scara-blatta Madraspat. Vaginis punctatis. 13 This is of the same shape and species (and only differs in being pounc't like a Thimble) with a Beetle, which Moffet p. 139. hath given a good Figure of, and says it's described by Pliny acute cluna which it has, and that in Latin it's call'd Blatta faetida: this I have observed in Cellars and Vaults, but do not find it stinks like the Cock-roaches or Blatta navalis, nor domestica, which are of another Genus. I have therefore distinguisht these wingless Beetles under this title. 14. Scara-blatta Madraspat. 6 albis maculis insigniter guttatis. 14 This is an elegant Beetle, and the more rare being of the unwinged kind, like the last, of which I have not yet observed above 5 or 6 sorts. Its Horns are near an inch long, composed of 10 or 12 Coralline-like geniculae, as are his feelers of 3, his upper forcipes are strong, the middle short and small, below these are his feeders, another pair which serve to carry his food to the upper forcipes or cutters. This Insect is remarkably distinguisht from all others, by 4 orbicular white spots on his Vaginae, and 2 oblong ones on his Shoulder. 15. Scara-pecten Madraspat. niger, naso clypeato monocerato. 15 16. Scara-pecten Guineensis niger, naso serrato: 16 17. Cantharis Madraspat. ruber, pedibus nigris. 17 18. Cantharus exoticus, ex nigro aurantioque fasciatus. 18 These differ in magnitude: I therefore take them to be of the oviparous kind. 19. Cantharus minor Madraspat. niger, bimaculis luteis 19 20. CimexMadraspat. major,e rubro & nigredine mixtus. 20 21 CimexMadraspat. minor, e rubro & nigredine mixtus. 21 22. Cimici affinis niger, maculis ochroleucis eleganter 22 notatus, e Madraspatan. 23. Bru(862) 23 23. Bruchus maximus viridis, Visci alis Madraspatanus. 24 24. Gryllus nigrescens bimaculatus e Symrna. This from Fort St George is the very same with a couple my hearty-Friend Mr Samuel Daniel Surgeon brought me some years since from Smyrna, with the next, and several other very Curious Insects. 25 25. Mantis Smyrnea gracilis, alis strictioribus. 26 26. Bombylus Madraspat. nigrescens cruribus plumosis. 27 27. Papilio Madraspatanus nigrescens, maculis sanguineis pallidisque interspersis. 28 28. Papilio Orientalis nigrescens, duplici serie maculis sanguineis. This differs from the last in having all Scarlet spots in both the rows. 29 29. Papilio Madraspat. nigrescens, maculis rubris bifariam dispositis. This is very like the aforegoing, except that instead of the upper row of spots, they are here in a cluster. 30 30. Papilio Orientalis caudatus nigrescens, maculis albis semicirculari. This is distinguisht from others, in having a row of White Spots thro the middle of the lower wing, which to make a Semicircle is continued on the edges of the upper. 31 31. Papilio Orientalis nigrescens macularum albarum duplici serie marginatus. This on the upper side has only 2 rows of greater and lesser specks along the lower edges, but on the other fide each upper Wing has 6 specks, and lower 4 out of row. 32 32. Papilio Orientalis, e fusco & albescente,striis maculisque mixtus. These 3 last Mr James Cuninghame and Mr Charles Perry, Surgeons, brought me formerly from other parts in the East Indies,and I have since received them from Fort St George. N. B. Most of the foregoing Insects being wholly new,I shall refer you for a farther Idea of them to their Figures, which I design with other Animals and Vegitables, in the sncceeding Tables of my Gazophylacium Naturae.
