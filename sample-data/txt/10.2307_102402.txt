(727) V. Part of a Letter from Mr. Aubry, F. R. S. Dated Feb 24. 16956. to Sir John Hoskyns, V. P. of the R. S. Concerning a Medicated Spring in Glamorganshire. IN Lancarim (the next Parish) is a Medicated Spring, much frequented from several Counties, time out of Mind, for the Kings Evil. There is a Rill of about an Ell broad between Two Collines, covered with Wood; about Twelve Yards from this Spring, the Rill falls from a Rock Eight or Nine Foot high, which makes a grateful Noise; the Spring (which is exceeding clear) comes out of a pure White Marle, I thought there had been no White Marle in Wales, for the Earth is Red. Above this Spring (about a Yard broad and deep) spreads an old Oak with Hoary Moss; on the Boughs whereof Two Crutches. A Graduate Doctor hereabout imputes the Vertue of this Spring to the Lime Stone, and says one of the chief Ingredients of the Doctors, for the Kings Evil, is Lime-Water. VI.
