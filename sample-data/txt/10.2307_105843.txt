[347] XLV. Observation of the Transit of Venus, and other Astronomical Observations, made at Gibraltar; contained in a Letter to the Astronomer Royal from Lieutenant Jardine. To regulate the clock. A N equal altitude instrument was fixed (nearly such as is described in Smith's Optics, vol. II. p. 328), on which was mounted a small telescope with cross hairs. Read Dec. 7, 1769.

S I R, I Have been disappointed in the pleasure I promised myself, when I saw you, of observing some occultations of fixt stars, by the Moon, &c. We shall be glad, if these observations can be of any service. We have endeavoured to discover to you the degree of dependence to be placed thereon. With regard to the clock, we conclude from these equal altitudes (correcting for difference of declination, &c.), that, on the 3d of June, it was before mean time 1~ 8~,8. You will easily discover if there is any error. We afterwards regulated by frequent equal altitudes, by a meridian line on the bottom of a window, and by the setting of stars behind some solid buildings. The latitude appears, from these double altitudes, to be somewhere between 36~ 3~, and 36~ 4~; but from more correct declinations, &c. you will be able to determine it more precisely. For the eclipse, we had no micrometer, nor any other method of determining the quantity of it. 1 To [350] To the eye, between 1/4th or 1/5th of the Sun's diameter seemed to be eclipsed. Though the beginning be rather incorrect, the end may be depended on. We shall be glad if you can determine, from hence, the latitude and longitude of the place, and to know the result of the discoveries made in our system, by the observations of the late transit, if you will favour us. I am, S I R, Your most obedient, humble servant, Gibraltar, July 14, 1769. Alexander Jardine. By re-computing these observations, I find, that the external contact of Venus happened at 6h 51~ 8~ the internal contact at 7h 8~ 21~, the beginning of the eclipse of the Sun at 18h 8~ 0~, and the end at 19h 20~ 33~, all apparent time; and that the latitude of the place, by the mean of the 4 altitudes of Cor Scorpii, is 36~ 4~ 44~, N. The dip of the horizon of the sea, for an elevation of 160 feet, may be reckoned 12~ 5~. Nevil Maskelyne. XLVI. Obser
