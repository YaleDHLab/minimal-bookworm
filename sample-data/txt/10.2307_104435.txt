II. A Letter from the Rev. Mr. Joseph Betts, M. A. and Fellow of University College, Oxon, to Martin Folkes, Esq; Pr. R. S. containing Observations on the late Comet, made at Sherborn and Oxford; with the Elements for computing its Motions. T H E Comet which appeared towards the End of last December, and in the following Months January and February, 1744. was first seen in England, at the Observatory of the Right Honourable the Earl of Macclesfield, Dec. 23. between 5 and 6 o' Clock in the Evening. It formed, at that time, an obtuse-angled Triangle, with (~) of Andromeda, and (~) Pegasi, the Comet being at the (a) See T A B. Figure III. (b) See T A B. Figure IV. (c) See Philos. Transact. n. 439. obtuse Read June 14. 1744. [92] obtuse Angle; and its Passage over the Meridian was observed at 5h 32~, mean Oxford Time. His Lordship's Observer could not then take its Distance from the Vertex accurately, the Comet's Transit being unexpected; however, by an Observation made at `Paris the same Evening by Mr. Monnier we have the Distance very nearly. His Lordship the next Day acquainting the Reverend Mr. Professor Bliss with this Discovery, gave us an Opportunity of looking after it at Oxford; but, unfortunately, bad Weather, and a continued Succession of cloudy Evenings prevented our observing it, till Dec. 31. but the Weather proving more favourable at Sherborn, its right Ascensions and Declinations were taken by his Lordship, the Result of which Observations is as follows: Note, That the equal Time is made use of in the following Observations, and that the Comet's Transits (reduced to the Meridian of Oxford) are only given to the nearest Half-Minute, as being sufficient for computing its Places. Dec. 23d 5h 32~) The right Ascension of the Comet by the Transit Instrument at Sherborn was found to be 5~ 48~ 1~; and its Polar Distance by Mr. Monnier 68~ 18~ 35~. Dec. 27d 5h 7~1/2) The right Ascension of the Comet, observed at Sherborn, was 3~ 41~ 7~; and its Declination 21~ 7~ 13~ North. Dec. 28d 5h 1~1/2) The observed right Ascension of the Comet was 3~ 11~ 8~; and its Distance from the Pole 69~ 0~ 38~. Dec. [93] Dec. 31d 4h 44~) The right Ascension of the Comet, by the Transit Instrument, was found to be 1~ 44~ 40~; and its Declination 20~ 36~ 37~ North. The same Evening, at 5h 53~) The Sky favouring us at Oxford, the Distance of the Comet from Aldebaran, taken with Hadley's Quadrant, was 60~ 10~, corrected for Refraction, 60~ 11~; from (~) Pegasi 7~ 2~1/2; corrected, 7~ 2~ 40~. January 12d 9h 10~) The Comet followed (~) Pegasi, in a five Foot Glass, 1~ 43~ 32~ of right Ascension; and was more northerly than the Star 1~ 36~ 00~: The right Ascension of the Star, by the Greenwich Observations at that time, was 354~ 52~ 12~, its Declination 17~ 41~ 55~: Therefore the Comet's right Ascension was 356~ 35~ 44~, and its Declination 19~ 17~ 55~. January 13d 6h 30~) The Distance of the Comet from Aldebaran, at a Medium of several Trials by the Quadrant, was 65~ 26~ 50~; corrected for Refraction 65~ 28~ 10~; its Distance from (~) Pegasi 6~ 31~1/2; corrected, 6~ 31~ 45~. At 8h 20~) The Comet followed (~) Pegasi 1~ 21~ 13~ of right Ascension; and was more northerly than the Star 1~ 30~ 33~. Hence the Comet's right Ascension was 356~ 13~ 25~; and its Declination 19~ 12~ 28~ North. January 16d at 6h 33~) The Comet's Distance was observed by the Quadrant from Aldebaran 66~ 36~3/4; corrected for Refraction 66~ 38~ 10~; from (~) Pegasi 7~ 0~3/4; corrected 7~ 1~. At 8h the same Evening) The Comet followed (~) Pegasi in the five Foot Glass 10~ 24~ of right Ascension; and was more northerly than the Star [94] Star 1~ 13~ 24~. Hence the Comet's right Ascension was 355~ 2~ 36~; and its Declination 18~ 55~ 19~ North. January 23d 6h 11~) The Comet's Distance was observed by the Quadrant from Aldebaran 69~ 26~2/3; corrected for Refraction 69~ 28~ 5~; from (~) Pegasi 8~ 42~ 1/4; corrected 8~ 42~ 35~. January 23d 7h 29~) The Comet preceded (~) Pegasi 2~ 43~ 27~ in right Ascension; and was North of the Star, in the 8 Foot Glass, 26~ 32~. Hence the Comet's right Ascension was 352~ 8~ 46~; and its Declination 18~ 8~ 27~. The Comet this Evening appeared exceedingly bright and distinct, and the Diameter of its Nucleus nearly equal to that of Jupiter's; its Tail, extending above 16 Degrees from its Body, pointed towards (~) of Andromeda; and was in Length (supposing the Sun's Parallax 10~) above 23 Millions of Miles; but cloudy Weather succeeding, we lost this agreeable Sighttill Feb. 5th. Feb. 5d 7h 31~1/2) A small Star of Pegasus, marked (~) by Bayer, preceded the Comet in right Ascension 1~ 40~ 20~; and was South of the Star 54~ 23~: The right Ascension of the Star, by the Greenwich Observations at that time, was 343~ 0~ 4~; its Declination 13~ 49~ 56~: Wherefore the Comet's right Ascension was 344~ 40~ 24~; and its Declination 14~ 44~ 19~ North. Feb. 11d 6h 37~1/2) The Comet followed (~) Pegasi; the Correction for Refraction being allowed 43~ 1~ in right Ascension; and was South of the Star 50~ 3~: The right Ascension of (~), by the Greenwich Observations at that time, was 338~ 28~ 24~; its [95] its Declination 10~ 51~3~: Therefore the Comet's right Ascension was 339~ 11~25~; and its Declination 10~ 1~North. Feb. 12d 6h 33~ The Comet followed (~) Pegasi 56~45~ of right Ascension; and was more southerly than the Star 44~42~. The right Ascension of (~), by the Greenwich Observations at that time, was 337~ 10~15~; its polar Distance 80~ 29~53~. Hence the Comet's right Ascension was 338~ 7~00~; and its Declination 8~ 45~25~ North. Feb. 13d 6h 25~ The Comet preceded (~) Pegasi 7~ 41~31~ in right Ascension; and was more southerly than the Star 1~13~: The right Ascension of the Star, at that time, was 344~ 41~55~; its Polar Distance 82~ 40~ Whence the right Ascension of the Comet was 337~ 0~24~; and its Declination 7~ 18~47~ North. This was the last Observation made at Oxford; the Comet being now so near the Sun, and withal so low in the Evening, that the great Difficulty of finding any Star to compare it with, made us desist from attempting it again; however, the prodigious Brightness it acquired, by its near Approach to the Sun, made it visible in the Day-time. And at Sherborn, Feb. 16d 23h 42~/2) Its right Ascension, by the Transit Instrument, was found to be 333~ 13~53~; and its Declination 0~ 2~40~ South. Feb. 17d 23h 36~ The right Ascension was observed 332~ 33~20~; and its Declination 2~ 29~00~. By the Help of these Observations, which were made by the Rev. Mr. Professor Bliss (the Transits excepted taken at Sherborn), I was enabled, by the Method delivered in the third Book of the N Principia, [96] Principia, to determine the Comet's Parabolic Trajectory; and found the Place of the ascending Node to be in 8. 15~ 45~20~; The Logarithm of the Perihelion Distance 9,346472: The Logarithm of the diurnal Motion 0,940420: The Place of the Perihelion ~. 17~ 12~55~; the Distance of the Perihelion from the Node 151~ 27~35~: The Logarithm, Sine, and Co-sine of the Inclination of the Orbit to the Ecliptic 9,865138, 9,832616: And thence the Time the Comet was in the Vertex of the Parabola, or the Time of the Perihelion, Feb. 19d 8h 12~ The Motion of the Comet, in its Orbit thus situated, was direct, or according to the Order of the Signs. From these Elements, by the Help of Dr. Halley's general Table (to which they are adapted), I computed the Comet's Places for the Times of Observation, exhibited in the following Table: To which are added the Comet's Longitudes and Latitudes deduced from the observed right Ascensions and Declinations; together with the Errors between the observed and computed Places; the Observations being all reduced to Oxford mean Time.

In order therefore to find how nearly they approached each other, I had the Curiosity to bring the Matter to Calculation; and presently found, there was above a Week's Difference in the Times of their Coming to the Nodes; the Comet passing its descending Node, Feb. 22. about 2h in the Morning; and Mercury not coming to his till Feb. 29. the Comet moving all that Time Southwards with a prodigious Velocity. Again, computing their Heliocentric Conjunction, which happened Feb. 18. about 1h in the Afternoon, I found the Comet was, at that time, distant from Mercury nearly 1/5 Part of the Semidiameter of the Orbis magnus; being almost twice as near to the Sun as the Planet ~; and having then 31~ 30~of North Latitude; Mercury's not exceeding 3~ 58~(to an Eye in the Sun): Whence it is easily collected, that the Comet could have no sensible Influence upon ~'s Motion. I shall now only beg Leave to observe, that the Elements above given cannot possibly differ much from the true. For, after an Interval of Two Months (in which time the Comet had gone thro' almost 1/3 Part of its Orbit), it is surprising to find the observed and computed Places agree so accurately, that the Difference no-where amounts to a Minute. In some Parts of the Orbit, the Agreement is still greater; particularly, in the Observations made at Sherborn, which come within half that Quantity; and would have 7 [99] have corresponded still nearer, but that I was ambitious to confine the whole Series of Observations within the narrow Limit above-mentioned; which I have at last compassed, not without a long and tedious Calculation: But, long and tedious as it was, I shall not repent of the Trouble I have been at, if I find my Endeavours agreeable to my astronomical Reader. It may, perhaps, be expected (considering the great Part of its Orbit the Comet described during its Appearance), that I should have settled its Period, and foretold its Return. This, I confess, would have given me great Pleasure; neither would I have spared any Pains in the Inquiry, had I met with any Prospect of Success; but the Period, upon my attemptigg it at first, came out so prodigiously long (the transverse Ax of the Ellipse being nearly equal to Infinity), that I was stopp'd short in my Inquiry; neither could I prevail upon myself to resume the Subject again, when, upon turning over Hevelius, I found the Account of Comets, which had appeared at long Intervals of Time from us (as it might reasonably be expected) so short and uncertain: But, could I procure Celsius's Observations, or any made after the Perihelion, I might be induced to fall to Work again; and would not fail communicating the Result, did I meet with Success; and, at the same time, the Elements of the Comet, which appeared in 1742, which I have had by me some time; not so perfect as I could wish, but as perfect as may be obtained from the few Observations I met with. The Comet was in Conjunction with the Sun, Feb. 15. about Midnight; and its Perigee, Feb. 16. about [100] about Ih in the Afternoon; at which time it was somewhat nearer the Earth than the Sun is at its Perigee; the Comet's Distance being then (,83) and the Sun's (,98) such Parts, as the Semidiameter of the Magnus Orbis is (,100); from which we may have some Idea of the Comet's Magnitude; and therefore may suppose it, at least, equal to the Earth.
