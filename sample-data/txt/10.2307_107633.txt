f 278 IV. Corrections applied to the Great Meridional Arc, extending from latitude 80 9' 38",39, to latitude 18o 3A 23",64, to reduce it to the Parliamentary Standard. By Lieutenant Colonel W. LAMBTON, F. R. S. and Corresponding Member of the Royal Academy of Sciences at Paris. Read January 9, i823. I HAVE recently received from Captain KATER a printed paper from -'the Philosophical Transactions for 1821, giving an account of his experiments in examining and comparing the different standard scales. I have read with great atten-tion and satisfaction the, whole of his results, and am glad to *find that the, Commissioners for considering the subject of weights and measures, have adopted Mr. BiRD'S scale of 1760, as by that means there is now a universal standard of comparison, which applies to the French metre, and to all the measures used on the Continent. From Captain KATER'S results it, appears, that my standard scale requires a multiplier of -,oooo18 to make it agree with the above , scale of Mr. BIRD ; and that RAMSDEN'S bar, used in the Trigonometrical Survey of Great Britain, requires the multiplier +,00007. That is to say, with respect to a measurement on the meridian, the degree depending on my brass .scale must be multiplied by, ooooi8 and the product subtracted.from the measure given by the scale, to reduce it to what it would have been, had it been measured by --1o/oel LAMnTON'S corrections applied what is8 now the parliamentary standard; and the d&gree depending on RAMSDEN'S bar, must be multiplied by oooog7, and the product added to the measure given by the bar, to reduce it to the standard measure. Now the arc which I have measured depends -on both these standards as I had a new chain sent out by Mr. BERGE in 1802, which was laid" off from RAMSDEN's bar at the temperature of 520; and this chain has never been used' as a measuring chain, but as a standard chain with which to compare the other, till after the base near Gooty was measured, when the irregularity in the wear of the measuring chain was firstdiscovered; for then the brass standard scale was had recourse to, and a correction applied; to the base ,and the triangles computed back to Yerracondah, one of the meridional stations about-half way between the base near Bangalore and that near Gooty: and this is the correction alluded to in page 487 in the second part of the Philosophical Transactions for 1818. It thence follows, that the meridional distance from Yerracondah to Daumergidda depends on the brass standard scale; and that the meridional distance from Yerracondah to Punnae, near Cape Comorin, depends on the standard chaini., I shall now proceed to give} the different sections of the. arc, correcting them by the above factors as I go along. From Namthabad back to Yerracondah, by the Feet. base, as measured in 18ll. -, 429120,6 S. The same distance by the corrected base, is 429134,3. s. Hence, from Namthabad to Yerracondah, de-, pending on the standard scale, is 4 429134,3 S. From Yerracondah to Dodagoontah, depending qnPtheX standard chain, is 332662,3 ". to the Great Meridional Arc, &c. 29 From Dodagoontah to Putchapolliam, depending Feet. on the standard chain, is _ 727334, s. These three being corrected by their respective factors, we shall have the meridional distance from Namthabad to Yerracondah 429126,6 s. From Yerracondah to Dodagoontah 332685,6 s. From Dodagoontah to Putchapolliam 727385,5 s. From Namthabad to Putchapolliam 1489197,7 s. or Fathoms 248199,6 s. Now the celestial arc between Namthabad and Putchapolliamr i 40 6'1 11,28=4,10313S.

Which, corrected by its multiplier, is 171528,76 s. And the celestial arc, is 2050'10",,54-20,83626 Hence 718366 60477,og, fathoms, the degree due to 9 34'441/ the middle point. Then from Namthabad to Daumergidda, depending on the standard scale, is _ 17890447 Which, corrected by its multiplier, is .178901.,48 The celestial arc is 2? 571231/ = 20,95648. Hence '78901-48= 6o51.i,65 fathoms, the degree due to i6?g4' 42" the middle point. From which we have the degrees as follows: , Fathoms.

Then computing from Eq. a, page 498, in the Philosophical Transactions for i8i8, 2d.

Now the terrestrial arc between Putchapolliam and Namthabad,248199,62 And between Namthabad and Daumergidda 178901,48 The sum of these three arcs is the terrestrial arc between latitude 904144 and Daumergidda 543104,0 The latitude of Daumergidda is 180 s 23If58 From which subtract 9 4 43 ,66 to the Great Meridional Arc, &c. 31 Their difference or arc = 8058'39"1,92 whose measure is 543104,02 To which add 01 SO ,o8 whose measure is 1346,08 Gives the No. (n) of complete degrees g 0 0 ,00 whose measure (A) = 544450,10 Then, referring to page 5og Philosophical Transactions for 1818, Part II., we have n = A =54445o, ; a (sin.()l sin 1) 06042. b sin.(2)tsin2.( )l) + (sin'.(3)/ -sin2.(')1) + &c. = ,263137; m'= 3 3A31 60477,76; 3 + 310,31 fl A-nm'=150,26; d-(A-m!n). +b-,45 and Q571 nearly.

Put A = 570, &c. the arc equal rad: then A m-= 3486457,9 and therefore 2 x 3486457,9 = 6972915,8 fathoms for the diameter of the equatorial circle ; equal the major axis of the elliptical meridian, which call a. Then if the minor axis be designated by b, we have b =(-e) a -6950442 fathoms for the polar axis of the spheroid, supposing it to be an ellipsoid. But 3,14159,&c. x6972916=21906074 the cirLt cumference of the circumscribing circle. Then if d =I -,oo64,355 we have 1 : (++ ) : : 21906074: .21871024, the length of the elliptic meridian. Hence 2187-1024 4 = 5467756 is the length of the quadrantal arc, which, reduced to inches, and multiplied by io,oooooo we get 39,3677 inches for the metre at the temperature of 620, which falls short of the French metre by ,0032 inches, when reduced to the same temperature. This conclusion is very satisfactory, and I hope that equal success will attend my operations to the northward. I have already measured another section, which extends to latitude to the Great Meridional Arc, &c. 38 210 6', having just returned from finishing it; and when all the necessary calculations and corrections are made, I shall draw out an account of the whole, and forward it to the Royal Society at a future period. The celestial arc has been determined by seven stars, but there are many now out of my reach, which I observed in the beginning. It may be satisfactory to the mathematicians in Europe to know, that I am now advancing through Hindoostan; and, from what I can learn from the different publick authorities, I do not apprehend any difficulty. They are all inviting in their letters, and all seem desirous that I should go through their respective districts. If my present arc be continued direct, it will pass through Bopaul, and near Seronje, where I shall have again to observe the stars and measure a base; and if Scindiah's country be in a quiet state, my meridian will pass near Gualior, his capital; and my sixth section will terminate near Agra, on the Jumna. I have made up my mind to execute all this if I live, and continue to have that flow of health and spirits which have hitherto attended me. The results of such an extensive measurement must be interesting to scientific men; and I shall exert my endeavours in doing justice to the work, and in giving a faithful account of the operations.
