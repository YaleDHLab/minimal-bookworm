U 295 J XVIII. On the measurement. of Snowdon, by the ThernometricalI Barometer. By the Revv F. J -H WOLLASTON, B.D. F.R.S. Read June 29, 182o. THE Royal Society did me the honour to notice in their Transactions, 1817, p. 183, the description of a Thermo.metrical Barometer, by which it was conceived that accessible heights might with convenience be measured ; and may therefore not be uninterested by the account of an actual measurement made with it. Having occasion last summer to visit Carnarvon, which would afford an opportunity of trying the instrument on the known height of Snowdon, and being aware that in 3550 feet the variations of the boiling temperature were not to be considered uniform, as they might in small elevations, on which alone I had before tried the experiment, I wished to provide myself previously With a table for making the necessary corrections; and from Dr. URE'S paper, Philosophical Transactions, 1818, p. 338, was supplied with data for the calculation. The law, which he discovers by approximation and lays down, is this: that, the elastic force of the air, or length of the column of mercury in the barometer being supposed 8o inches when water boils at 2o1i of Fahrenheit, 130 will be the length of the column 1,)23 at 2o20; 1-23 X -24 the length at 1920; and so on progressively, adding another increased divisor for every 100 of thermometrical temperature. For my purpose it was necessary to calculate the variations at smaller intervals than ten degrees, and particularly to obtain those between 2120 and 2o0o, by getting a series of 296 The Rev. F. J.o I WOLLASTONOn the divisors for each degree, instead of the simple divisor of 1 ,3 for the whole. By taking the tenth of the logarithm of 1,23, the uniform divisor appears to be ioot; but to make the successive divisors increase at the lower temperatures,, as Dr'. URE does, suppose them to be taken thus; 1 ,02059 1,0o068 1,02077 I ocgwo86 1.,02095 1,02105 1,02114 1,02123 1$I ,032 1,02141 10,21000 The mean of which is 1.o0 2.

For the differences between each degree, the elevations may be taken with sufficient accuracy by simple proportion. Table I.

F. J. H. WOLLASTON on the In. the application of this table to use, it must be adapted tothe scale of the particular thermometrical barometer employed. In' my former paper, I observed that a change of 1? Fahrenheit appeared to be produced by 0,589 of the common barometer. This was deduced from the comparison of my long thermometer of 3,98 inches to every degree with a common barometer,, But having subsequently compared the same thermometer with a mountain barometer by T.ROUGHTON, where I could ascertain the adjustment for the height of the mercury in the basin, I found that at a mean of 29,5 inches, o,603 of barometer corrected was equal to ad of Fahrenheit. This conclusion agrees very closely with the table deduced from Dr. URE'S observations, 'in, which be. tween aui1 and H1:i the difference of the mercurial column is o,6o5 nearly at the meanheight of 29,7, and would be rather less at 29,5. On the scale of the instrument which I have now in use, the half inch is divided into ten parts, and by the Vernier into a hundred; the inch, therefore, into two Thundred; and I find by observation, that 1,ooo of the corrected barometer equals 372 partson the scale of the ther. mometrical barometer, or 1,86 inch; consequently, o,605 barometer or 1A Fahrenheit, = 225 parts on the scale, or inch which is a sensibility entirely sufficient. And those 225 parts being supposed, according to Table I =s5i feet between 2110 and 20,iloo parts will equal 236 feet at that part of the scale. Between 2o02 and 2030, 225 parts 55 feet, and, consequently, ioo parts24,6 feet nearly; and so of every other point ; and the following table of heights, corresponding with the scale of my instrument, will be found in the nearest whole numbers. measurement of Snowdon by the Thermometrical Barometer. 299 TABLE II.

As the instrument I was about to employ had a scale of only four inches, or 8oo parts, and could therefore scarcely Soo The Rev. F. J. H. WOLLASTON on the measure at its utmost limits 1goo feet, it was necessary, on a height of 3550 feet, to divide the whole measurement into two, or, for greater security, into three lengths, and it became therefore a fair trial of -the practical use of the instrument in every respect. On the 24th of August, having occasion to ride fromn Carnarvon to Gregory's New Inn, near Llanberis Lake, at the foot of Snowdon, for the purpose of securing accommodations for my party, I took the instrument in my pocket, having previously boiled it on the ground floor of the Vicar. age house at Carnarvon, where it stood at 517,5, thermometer 660, barometer 3o,o. In the parlour at Gregory's it stood at 401, thermometer 66?, barometer not changed during my absence; difference at the two stations i 1615. 100: 1 i6.:5 236: 275 feet, the approximateheight: add the correction o,o8g9 x 275 from General . 24.5 Roy's table following ) 299,5 feet, the corrected height of Gregory's above the Vicarage. The descent from the Vicarage to the north end of Car-. narvon quay, was taken by levelling, and found 11,25 feet. August 27. The instrument had been set at Gregory's at 768, before the party began to ascend the hill; but when we came to the place where the guide supposed we had ascended half way, it stood at about zoo, showing that we had not gone far enough to take the whole in two lengths of the scale; and we therefore proceeded farther, to a point, opposite a pass in the ridge of Snowdon, called Bwlch Cymbrw_ nog, by which the hill is ascended from Nant. In carrying the instrument incautiously from the former point while measurement of Snowdon by the Thermometrical Barometer. sot cooling, the mercury was drawn into the tube from the cap at the top, and the previous measure from Gregory's was therefore lost. I mention this, to show how the measure was afterwards recovered on descending. At this point which I call H, the half height, the thermometrical barometer was set at 792, in the manner directed in my former paper; thermometer 620. When boiled again on the summit it stood at 86, thermometer 660. On descending again to HI it boiled at 785, thermometer 630. From this point, my measurement to Gregory's downward, was to be made for recovering the accidental loss in the ascent ; and for'that purpose an operation was to be performed on the instrument, by no means so easy as that for taking a succeeding stage upward; for the mercury must in this case be expanded out of the tube into the cap over the flame of the lamp, until on boiling, it stands as near as may be requisite to the bottom of the scale. This was done at H. and the water boiled at 1X46, thermometer 630. On carrying it down to the Inn it stood at 695, thermometer 650. The barometer observed at Carnarvon about the time of boiling at H, ona ascending, was at 29,91; and at the time of boiling there the second timne it stood at 29,88, where I found it on my return to Carnarvon. Between Gregory's and H, the difference 695 X46 = 549, mean thermometer 640, barometer 29,9. Between H and thee summit, the difference (fromn the mean of the two observations at H 792+785=) 788,5 86 702,5, mean thermoometer 640, 1The mean thermometer being the same in both lengths, they may be calculated together, the total being 549 + 702,s5 12 5i5, thermometer 640.

General Roy's measurement trigonometrically makes it .35554 feet, and barometrically 3548,9 feet. During the same visit to Carnarvon, I took the opportunity of trying the instrument on Moel Elio, which stands between that place and Snowdon and has also been measured by General Roy. On September 6 at the Vicarage, the thermometrical barometer stood at 737, thermometer 590, barometer 29,8. In the blacksmith's shop at Waen Fawr, at the foot of Moel Elio, water boiled at 550o thermometer 57' The, instrument was here set to 767, and carried to the summit, where by the pile of stones it stood at 25, thermometer e5' From Vicarage to Waen Fawr, the difference 737 550 -87, mean therm. ;80, 187 parts 44i feet, Add correction o0o669 X 44' = 2965 Corrected height from, Vicarage to Waen Fawr 470,5 feet.

The three measurements in this instance, do not agree so well as at Snow.-Jon: whether this arises in any degree from the different forms of the two mountains, rendering the point of observation less definite in the one case, I will not pretend to say; SnowAdon terminates in a point, Moel Elio has a large bare summit. To save the trouble of reference to General Roy's Paper, Philosophical Transactions, 1777, p. 771, I give here from that Paper, a part of the Table for correction on account of the expansion of the column of air between two stations at different temperatures, in thousandth parts of an observed height.

The thermometer itself is straight, and carried up the middle of the scale. The index moves by hand on a square rod on one side of the glass tube, 304 The Rev. F. J. R. WOLLASTON on the with an adjustment by a screw at the top. The vernier isapplied to the edge of the scale. I recommend that in making these thermometers the bulb be blown on a piece of tube of -L inch bore, or nearly, so that the mercury expanded before boiling may be wholly contained in that tube without requiring an upper bulb; for if that bulb be made of a size to allow the mercury to separate in it, a globule may lodge in the upper part of it near the fine thread, and be attended with much inconvenience. To protect the lamp from wind more effectually than wasdone by the small tent-stand formerly described, I have made the outside case of thin copper, hard soldered, so as to serve as a lanthorn to contain the lamp burning at bottom; while the boiler, which is made of a drawn tube, with the thermometer, slips down from above, and is also protected from the cold air during the experiment The inverted boiler screws as before, over the scale of the thermometer, and packs in the centre of the case for carriage, the bulb of the thermometer going downwards into the chimney of the lamp; round the chimney in the lower part of the case, is space sufficient for stowing some matches of the oxymuriate of potash, a bottle of sulphuric acid, a wax candle, a tin bottle of water, a pair of scissors for trimming the lamp, a turnscrew and thermometer. In the upper part is also room for some tow or rag for cleaning, &c. ; and the whole, when packed for use, weighs two pounds. Still farther to be guarded against wind, if necessary, I carried, as a walkingstick, a rod cut into three, and jointed at top, which belongs to a theodolite as its stand and had in my pocket a conical bag of thin cotton, which would cover the whole as a tents measurement of Snowdon by the Thermometrical Barometer. 305 and might be pegged down to the ground if occasion required. This precaution, though it had been needless! on Snowdon, was of use on Moel Elio, where I had a very high wind. The tent has of course an opening on one side, where the instrument, which hangs from a hook in the centre, is accessible. S. Weald, bune, i82o.
