[577] An Abstract of a Letter from Liege concerning a strange preservation of four Men in a Mine 24 days without any food, April 9. 84. SOme Colliers working in a Cole-Pit at Herstol about half a League from ~ on our Shrove Munday Feb. ~ betwixt 7 and 8 in the morning,one of them peirced a veine of water, which gushing in violently drowned one, those that were near the mouth of the Pit were drawn out, but four of them being further within saved themselves upon a little ascent within the Min~, which has several Lanes or Allies in it, and were shut in by the water which stopt their passage out. 24 days were spent in drawing off the water, rather to render the mine useful again then ont of any hopes of saving the men: at last on Thursday March the 9th. being the 25 th of their consinement, men entred in, found these 4 alive, and drew them out and I my self among many others saw and examined them about these articulars: they had not a morsel of Bread with them, but lived on the water of a little Fountain which broke out by them: 2 bottle of which I caused to be evaporated to sec if it were any thing extraordinary, and found nothing but a scarce perceptible Calx remaining.
