The Sun's Eclipse of July 14, 1748. observed at Marlborough House, with the twelve Foot refracting Telescope, fix'd as a Finder to the Tube of the great twelve Foot Reflector; by John Bevis M. D. Apparent Time. d h ~ ~ July 13. 9. 3. 50 The Beginning, which perhaps might be 2~ or 3~ sooner. 39. Read Nov. 10. 1748. [522] Apparent Time. d h ~ ~ July 13. 9. 39. 42. The first little Spot in the Western Cluster, quite covered. 52. 00. The biggest of that Cluster quite cover'd, yet somewhat doubtful for flying Clouds. 10. 12. 08. The middle one of three considerable Spots towards the Eastern Limb half cover'd. The End could not be precisely observed for flying Clouds; at 12. 09. 15. it was not quite over; but at 12. 09. 35. the Sun was clear, and nothing of the Eclipse left. N. B. The Wind was so boisterous, that no Phases could be measured with a Micrometer. The Moon's Eclipse of July 28. 1748. observ'd at the same Place. d <inferred>h</inferred> ~ ~ July 28. 10. 13. 28. The Penumbra discernible. 06. 30. The Beginning, as most of the Company judged. 18. 38. Mare Humorum just touch'd. 26. 24. Began to touch Tycho. 27. 51. Tycho bisected. 24. 09. Tycho cover'd. 29. 53. Touch'd Grimaldi. 30. 25. Mare Humorum cover'd. 34. 14. Grimaldi cover'd. July [523] <inferred>d</inferred> <inferred>h</inferred> ~ ~ July 28. 12. 24. 30. The End. 27. 40. The Penumbra quite gone. About the Middle of the Eclipse, the Moon's Diameter, perpendicular to the Equator, measur'd in a 5 Foot Telescope was 33~ 50~; perhaps 15~ or 20~ greater than it would have been found to be with a 12 Foot Tube. J. Bevis. I lately received the following Letter from a Person unknown to me. S I R, I HAD the Pleasure to observe the Sun's Eclipse July last, which was as follows. The Beginning 9<inferred>h</inferred>. 1~. 0~. a. m. The End 0. 5. 25. p. m. at 10<inferred>h</inferred>. 32~. 10~. a. m. 10~. 18~. were dark, which I take to be the greatest with us. These are apparent Times, from a well adjusted Clock (by a Meridian drawn June 10, on a Plate of Metal), and corrected to the Time of Observation. Luffwick near Thrapston Northamptonshire. Our Latitude is 52~. 27~. 30~. I hope by this, and future Observations, I shall be able to determine our Situation with respect to yours. I am, Oct. 21. 1748. S I R, &c. Mark Day. Z z z VIII.
