[ 25 ] II. A Supplementary Meimoir on the Theory of Matrices. By A. CAYLEY, Esq., F.R. S. Received October 24,-Read December 7, 1865. M. HERMITE, in a paper "1 Sur la theorie de la transformation des fonctions Abeliennes," Comptes Rendus, t. xl. (1855), pp. 249, &c., establishes incidentally the properties of the matrix for the automorphic linear transformation of the bipartite quadric function Xw' +yz'-zy'-wx', or transformation of this function into one of the like form, XW'+YZ'-ZY'-WX'. These properties are (as will. be. shown) deducible from a general formula in my " Memoir on the Autom-orphic Linear Transformation of a Bipartite Quadric Function," Phil. Trans. vol. exlviii. (1858), pp.. 39-46;. but the particular case in question is an extremely interesting one, the theory whereof is worthy of an independent investigation. For convenience the number of variables is taken to be four; but it will be at once seen that as well the demonstrations as the results are in fact applicable to any even number whatever of variables. Article Nos. 1 & 2.-Notation and Remarks. 1. I use throughout the notation and formule contained in my "I Memoir on the Theory of Matrices," Phil. Trans. vol. cxlviii. (1858), pp. 17-37, and in the above-mentioned memoir on the Automorphic Transformation. With respect to the composition of matrices, the rule of composition is as follows, viz.., any line of the compound matrix is obtained by combining the corresponding line of the first or further component matrix with the several columns of the second or nearer component matrix; it is~very convenient to indicate this by the algorithm, (a, b, c lg , ,y )-a, c ) 11 a', b6 c' j | 3a , .'I (a', bt c') all, b~l'" at/," it," y(all " V'l e~u ,, , which exhibits very clearly the terms which are to be combined together; thus in the upper left-hand corner we have (a, 6, c(a, a', a"), and so for the, other places in -the compound matrix. 2. It is not in the Memoir on Matrices explicitly remarked, but it is easy to see that sums of matrices, all the matrices beingof. the same order, may be multiplied together by the ordinary rule; thus (A+B)(C+D)=AC+AD+BC+BD: this remarlk will be useful in the sequel.

We have to consider the formulae for the automorphic linear transformation of the function xw'+yz'-zy'/-wx, that is, of the function -,.,1, ., 1, ., . 1, . , ., =(2Qx, y, Z, xwq(, y', z', w'), viz., if the variables are transformed by the formula (X* Z, :,o)-(rIKX , Y.3 ZW )I (x', Z' &' ~)=j1~~,Yt, V , Z[WI), then the matrix (LI) is such that we have identically PIXx, Y, Z, qu](4 Ly, Z', qvf) =( (KXI YJ Z~ W3X' Y1Z',W) the expression for (LI) is given in my memoir above referred to; viz., observing that the matrix (2) is skew symmetrical, then (No. 13) we have where T is an arbitrary symmetrical matrix. 4. I propose to compare with the matrix II the inverse matrix HI-. Recollecting that in the theory of matrices (ABCD)-1=D-'C-1B-1A-', we have Il-l Q-21P0+yXQ0 y) -l0; and it is to be shown that II and II-1 are composed of terms which (except as to their signs) are the same in each, so that either of these matrices is derivable from the other by a peculiar form of transposition. It is to be borne in mind throughout that T is symmetrical, Q skew symmetrical. 5. I write for greater convenience l' 21Q(T? 2)(T2>'2, and I compare in the first instance the matrices (T -9)(T+2)?' and (T+2)(XT2)-' 6. Any matrix whatever, and therefore the matrix (T + Q)-1, may be exhibited as the sum of a symmetrical matrix and a skew symmetrical matrix; that is, we may write (T+2')=T?+2, where T' is symmetrical, 2' is skew symmetrical. We have then PROFESSOR CAYLEY ON THE THEORY OF MATRICES. -27 where, here and in what follows, 1 denotes the matrix unity. Moreover T a2= tr.(T+ ~ and thence (T2)-' = (tr.(T+U2)<1 _tr. (T+ &)= tr.(T'+Q')=T_ l-i2 that is, (Y -Q)T/fQf, and thence also (T-&?)(Tt2?1= (TQ)(T2') =1. We have therefore (T Q)(T + )-i = (T + 12 :)(rTf+ t) = I2 Q(rT + 15+ (T + 1)(T Q)-i=(T U+ 22)(TT) 2 1)2u(T'-,Q'). 7. Suppose for a moment that T'+2'=( a, 6, c, d e, f, g, h 5, I, k, I ml , 0, _p and therefore rT-'_ a, :ez, tj in b5 f,v, n K, g, k, o d, I, pj 8. We have . .

The expression for(T-f2)-> is obtained from that of (T +f>)-' by merely transposing the terms of the matrix, or, what is the same thing, by changing the signs of A , P 5 'r. And it would be easy by means of these developed values to verify the foregoing comparison of (T-?)(T+Q2>1 and (T+2)(Tf Q)-1. Article Nos. 14 to 22.-Second Investigation. 14.

We have therefore V2= (S12 8341+ S13 S42 + 814 823),9 or extracting the square root of each side, and determining the sign by a comparison of any single term, we have V = 3 s -S12 S.14 13 S42 S14 823 which is one of the required forms of V. 17.
