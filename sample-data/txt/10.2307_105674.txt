[582] XCVI. Minutes of the Observation of the Transit of Venus over the Sun, the 6th of June 1761, taken at Calcutta in Bengal, Latitude 22~ 30~, Longitude East from London nearly 92~: communicated from the Court of Directors of the East India Company, by Charles Morton, M. D. F. R. S. h ~ ~ THE appulse uncertain, 8 11 35 but very apparent at The center of Venus on the Sun's limb 8 16 35 The interior contact at the ingress 8 24 40 Interior contact at the egress 2 15 55 Center of Venus on the Sun's limb at 2 24 0 the egress Total egress 2 32 0 Read Nov. 4, 1762. The above observations were minuted from a stopwatch of Mr. Ellicott's, having no pendulum-clock or time-piece. The weather being cloudy for several days before that of observation, there was no opportunity of ascertaining the error of the watch; but, on the day of observation, I found, upon comparing the watch with a meridian line in the town-hall, that when the center of the Sun's image was on the meridian line, the time pointed by the watch was 4~ 10~ past twelve. Comparing the watch the 7th, 8th, and 9th June with the meridian line, I found it had gained nearly two minutes each day, the time pointed by the watch on the 9th June being 10~ 5~, when the Sun was on the meridian. I It [583] It took about 5~ to wind the watch up every day, which I carefully observed; from the aforegoing remarks I have made the following corrections. h ~ ~ Centre of Venus on the Sun's limb at 8 12 54 ingress Interior contact at the ingress 8 20 58 Interior contact at the egress 2 11 34 Centre of Venus on the Sun's limb at 2 19 38 the egress Total egress 2 27 38 And if the same time be allowed for the first semidiameter of the planet coming on as the other three, it must have 6 22 48 commenced at 8h 4~ 50~, so that the total duration was William Magee.
