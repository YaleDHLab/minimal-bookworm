An Account of the Earthquake at Lisbon, 31st March 1761: In a Letter from thence, dated the 2d April 1761, to Joseph Salvador, Esq; F. R. S. THE earthquake happened the 31st last month, precisely at twelve o'clock, and lasted full five minutes, with a smart and equal vibration. It exceeded all the others, except that of the first November 1755. Thank God, it was attended with no other consequences, but that of alarming the inhabitants, throwing down some ruins, and rending some houses. About an hour and a quarter afterwards, the sea began to flow and ebb, about eight fleet perpendicular, every six minutes, and continued till night. Some small shocks were felt before and since, but of no moment; every Read April 23, 1761. [242] every body seems at ease, and things go on in their usual channel. Mr. Salvador has received many other letters, which severally confirm these particulars.
