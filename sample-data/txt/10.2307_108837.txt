[ 417 ] XIX. On a New Method qf Approximation applicable to Elliptic and Ultra-elliptic Functions.-Second Memoir*. By CHARLES W. MERRIFIELD. Communicated by W. SPOTTISWOODE, Esq., P.RS. Received March 20,-Read April 3, 1862. SINCE my first memoir on this subject was read before the Society, Mr. SYLVESTER has published a method, more general than mine, of applying rational approximation to facilitate the computation of the integrals of irrational functions. This method, at which he had arrived independently, included, a' majori, the one which was the subject of my memoir. Aided by his papers, my subsequent studies have enabled me to view the method with more generality, as well as with more precision and completeness of detail, and I am now able to present it in a sufficiently finished and practical form for the immediate use of the computer. I have also computed auxiliary Tables, to render its application easier in certain cases. Any rational formula, which gives approximately the value of a function to be integrated, may be integrated in lieu of it, and the result will in general be an approximate value of the integral sought. But for such a process to be of any practical utility, the convergence of the formula must be excessive, for the complexity of the integral forms is so great that the labour would be enormous, unless the terms were very few in number. In the discovery of formulae sufficiently convergent for the purpose, lies the success of the method. We are by no means restricted to functions under a square root, or even to pure radical forms at all. The principle applies with equal generality to functions which are given implicitly as roots of equations, and thus to a class of differential equations; and Mr. SYLVESTER has well remarked that these formulae not only afford facilities for computation, as by a method of quadratures, but also enable us to assign superior and inferior limits to an integral, without losing its generality of form. I shall begin with the approximation to the square root, giving it in its general form, and explaining its exact analytical signification. I shall then show its application to Elliptic Functions, and how, in the ordinary cases, certain simple reductions can be effected, which greatly lessen the labour of computation; and I shall give these reductions for the cases more commonly occurring, with some examples and working formulae. I shall then add a short account of the extension of the method. The paragraphs in the first two sections of this paper bear a consecutive number for convenience of reference.* For the First Memoir, see the Philosophical Transactions for 1860, p. 223.IIDCCCLXII. 3 L 418 MR. C. W. MERRIFIELD ON A NEW METHOD OF APPROXIMATION SECTION I.-Approximants to the Square Root. 1. Mr. SYLVESTER gives, for the approximants to the square root, the following statement: "Let r be an approximate value of VN; then by that mode of application of NEWTON'S method of approximation to the equation xa=N, which is equivalent to the use of continued fractions, -we may easily establish the following theorem, viz., that r2+N r3+3rN r4+6r2N+N2 r5?+Or3N+5rN2 r7 rV+N' 4r3+4rN ' 5r4 + l1Or2N+N2' will be successive approximations to VN A 2. Their general form is (r? VN)i+(r-VN)i N. Y=(r+VN)Y-(r-4/N)i7N.(1) which is always rational. In this form the approximation to VN as i increases is obvious. The method of my previous memoir is simply the particular case of i=2k. 3. If we wish to approximate to Nai, we may take the reciprocal of (1.), or, what is simpler, we may divide (1.) by N, thus obtaining (r+VN)i+(r-5VN) 1I (r+ i/N)i-(r-vN)i <7N *. (2.) Before we can integrate these formulae, we must reduce them by means of the method of rational fractions; the simplest and most general way is as follows: 4. Let 6 be an ith root of unity; then, obviously, log (1 -_X)=log (1_X)+log (1_?2X)+. +iog (1 eI).

If we add the pairs k and i-kI, we obtain for the sum of the pair, 2(r+ V/N)2-2(r/N)2 (r+ A/N)2+ (rVN)2-(ok +?g-k) (r2 -N) 8rN _r 2(r2?-N) (gk~ + gak (rd -N) orsame denominator' APPLICABLE TO ELLIPTIC AND ULTRA-ELLIPTIC FUNCTIONS. 419 according to whether the upper or lower sign be taken. Now, because g is an ith root 2A7r of unity, ?k+i-k =2 cos -y-, and the sum of the pair reduces itself, for VN, to 1 4rN 1 2rN ~~k ~~j 2k~r kx h (r2+N)-cos (r2-N) r2sin2' i+ Ncos2 7r 1 2rN 1 2rN N Nsing (r2-N) i r2 cos2!

Our grouping the terms in pairs has limited the value of k to range from i to 9 (i-1) when i is odd. There is an odd term which, however, presents no difficulty, being r r simply a in the case of VN, and iN in the case of N-4. When i is even, k is limited to r2?N. r2?N range from I to 1 i-1, and the odd term becomes + in the case of VN, and iN in the case of N-4. It is important to bear in mind that the term just mentioned is an odd term, and therefore not affected with the coefficient 2, which appears in the terms composed of pairs corresponding to imaginary roots. 7. The value of i, which I consider to be most useful for general purposes, is i= 8: in r2 +N r2?N kir this case the odd term becomes 8r or 8N , and the other values of -are three in number, viz. 22?30', 450, 670 30'. With proper precautions i=8 will almost always give seven or more figures correct. 8. If we now give infinite values to k and i and pass from the summation to the definite integral, we have (putting X=-) rib~~j 2rdx 2rrt do r9= +(N-r2) cos2v __7rN_ 2rX rj +r n2 and since rir d( 27 1 p . sin2 Vl p this is an identical equation, as it ought to be. 9. This use of approximants, therefore, is simply the application of the method of 3 L2 420 MR. C. W. MERRIFIELD ON A NEW METHOD OF APPROXIMATION quadratures to a definite integral, which we substitute for the surd proposed for evaluation. 10. It would appear at first sight that a full application of the method of quadratures in the ordinary way, with the help of differences, would give better results than the mere summation of the ordinates. But this is not the case; for the differences diverge immediately. If we use differential coefficients for the quadrature, instead of differences, we have an opposite anomaly, namely that the correction of the summation appears to be absolutely nil, inasmuch as the differential coefficients which appear in the series are all of odd order, and the numerator of each of them contains the factor sin p cos p, which vanishes at both the limits 0 and 1r. LEGENDRE has discussed this point. See the Appendix to the second volume of his ' Fonctions Elliptiques,' p. 578. 11. The application of the method to integrations, then, lies in the substitution for t M do f SotJ2i 2Mr.dA.dt Jo / ? 0J r2+ (N-r2) COS2ATI in which, since X and t are perfectly independent of each other, we may change the order of integration, thus obtaining si rt 2Mr. dt 3J1 ,lJOr2 + (Nr2) cos2 XJ dX; and the rest of the operation depends upon our being able to perform the integration in } generally, and then to determine the integral in X by quadratures. The great advantage of the method turns upon the easy application of the method of quadratures, in consequence of our not requiring to difference the ordinates. 12. One way of exhibiting generally the degree of convergence is as follows: N ii always lies between Nl(rfy N)i+ (rVN)i (+V/N) i(r VN)~ (r + VN)t-(r-V.t/N)i and Ni* (r + v/N)i?(r-v/N)i' and the error of either is therefore always less than their difference, Ni1 ~~ 4(r2-N)i (r+ v/N)2i-(rVN) 13. There is another mode, by which, in any given case, we may see how far it is necessary to carry our work in order to obtain a given number of decimals correctly in the result. Let Om be determined by the equation COm dOr MC0o dOl J cos .m jo cos 91 and let sin 0or JN' whichever may be less than unity; then the rnth approximant will be This is easily seen from the general term of the approximant, since f dO 1 /1+sinO\ d I (I + sin 0o) APPLICABLE TO ELLIPTIC AND ULTRA-ELLIPTIC FUNCTIONS. 421 14. A table of meridional parts, such as is given in the books on Navigation, if carried far enough, would solve this equation. I have calculated an auxiliary Table for the purpose, as follows: Let cosec p-1=z, log, tan 7r+ p =y then Y= log, =210g21lgZ+ 1lg(1+?z) -2log 2 . log + 6 + Z3 l4 To bring this formula to the same unit as the common Table of meridional parts, we must multiply it by the number of minutes in the arc equal to unity, or by L=3437-74677 07849 4, whence we have 1' L log, 2=1191-43224 08243 2, and 1 Llog8 10=3958&85223 39129 100. These data give the following Table, the argument being the common logarithm of z with its sign changed; that is, the number of places which are correct: 1logZ.I y -log Z. ,. llog.Iy 1 5234-14859 6 24944-54650 11 44738-80681 2 9117-70966 7 28903-39796 12 48697-65905 3 l3068-84816 8 32862-25012 13 52656-51128 4 17026-92712 9 36821-10235 14 56615 36352 5 20985-70200 10 40779-95458 15 60574-21575 15. As a simple example, let N=3, r=2; .'.r =sin 600: the meridional parts for r 600=4527; and in order that the error may not exceed unity in the tenth place of figures, we must have m or i= 4527 =9; so that we must make i=9 at least, for the 10th figure to be correct. 16. These methods of course only exhibit the degree of approximation on the surd itself. The proportionate approximation is generally greater on the integral than on the simple surd, because the first approximant is usually so chosen as to be identical with the surd at one of the limits, and it is only near the other limit that the discrepancy tells. SECTION II.-Details of Reduction and Computation. 17. The chief assistance, which can be provided a priori for the computer, consists in 2Mrdt the exhibition and discussion, for the ordinary forms, of the integrals r + (N -r) cos" xr and of the auxiliary functions which present themselves in its reduction. 18. In applying these methods to elliptic integrals, the radical and the first approximant r must both be of a simple form, and it is advisable that r2-N or N-r2 should be 422 AIR. C. W. MERRIFIELD ON A NEW METHOID OF APPROXIMATION of a square form. For the common form of the elliptic radical V(1 -sin2 0. sin2 '), our choice is practically limited to (1) r=1, (2) r=cos Pi (3) r=sin 0. cos , (4) r=cos 0, (5) r=cos 0. sinp. And on these suppositions I now proceed to the integration of the general form of the reduced approximant for C(I-sin20.sin2p)-Yd,=Szd@p. I omit mention of the const~ants of integration, because very slight changes in the function may alter them. The first of our three cases require, as they stand, no constant, and these are the most useful cases.

It will be observed that the first four cases, and the sixth, depend upon a radical of the form V(1 -sin2 A. sin2 a), where Z is restricted to the selected values of Assuming the modulus sin A not to vary, it would therefore in general be better to begin by computing the radical for the selected values. I have computed, and I append to this paper, a Table of this radical, the selected values of Xbeing 22? 30', 450, and 670 30)', while A ranges by whole degrees from 1? to 900 inclusive. Every entry but the last in the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th columns of the Table was computed by myself in duplicate with VEGA'S ten-figure logarithms, by the help of two or more of the following formula, some of which are from LEGEYDEE. 20.

C. W. MERRIFIELD ON A NEW METHOD OF APPROXIMATION then we shall also have, and with great approximation, log s=log (t . cos2 L)+(t-t . cos2 L) =log (c. cot2 L)+(c+c. cot2 L), log c=log (s . tan2 L)?(s+s . tan2 L) =log (t . sin2 L)+(t-t. sin2 L), log t=log (s. sec2 L)(s-s . sec2 L) =log (c. cosec2 L) + (c -c cosec2 L). I have given the whole set of six, but my Table was computed with the pair for log c. By way of example, I add a specimen copy of one of my working sheets. The use of so many as ten figures is not altogether unnecessary, because otherwise, when A is nearly equal to unity, the value of log (1-A) or of log 1 + cannot be had with exactness. 21. The following formulae will also be found in many cases preferable, both for exactness and facility, to the ordinary use of logarithmic tables by means of differences. These formulw, as well as those of the previous paragraph, are but applications of rTAYLoR'S theorem, reduced to a shape fit for the computer. Even where only seven figures are required their application is frequently much easier, and gives more exact results, than interpolation by differences. In what follows, x is supposed to be the nearest tabular entry. 22. To find logy from log tan y.-Let us assume simultaneously log y=log x+l, log tan y=log tan x+t. Putting u =log a, z-log tan x, we have du sin 2x d2u sin 2X sin 2wx and dZ2M 2 t cos 2x-iz M being the modulus of the logarithms. Hence, by TAYLOR'S theorem, 1=t 2x j{1Mt( 2w cos 2x) } nearly. Taking the logarithm, this becomes log sin 2w\ (sin 2x log logt 2) 2 COS 2x} l to . sin x. cos i) tt. sin xZ. cos t =10y Z -m ++ t+:2t sin2 X. The latter is the better shape for a working formula, because log sin x and log cos X are found in the same page and line as log tan x, while log sin 2x must be looked for elsewhere. The first term alone is sufficient when X is small; but when x much exceeds 450 cos 2x changes its sign, and even the entire formula is insufficient. The maximum value of the coefficient of t in the second term is 16 0631, corresponding to x= 78' 33' 26X' 5. InL many cases, where the first term alone is insufficient, a rough interpolation, made at APPLICABLE TO ELLIPTIC ANDJ ULTRA-ELLIPTIC FUNCTIONS. 425 sight from the following Table, will answer the purpose; it is a Table of the value of (s2i-cos 2x' and of its logarithm, from x=45? to x= 90?. 45 0'63662 9 80387 70 1|02910 001246 50 0173816 9-86815 75 1P05658 0-02390 55 0-83149 9*91986 80 1*06216 0-02619 60 0*91349 9-96070 85 1P04331 0-01843 65 0-98041 9-99141 90 I. 0 The Table shows that, past 450, the formula lt sin x CQS X _ log l-=logV -+ is a better approximation than when the Ft is omitted. It is to be remarked that t is at its minimum for x 450, and increases both towards x= 0 and x=900. Near the latter limit, where great accuracy is required, we must proceed as follows. Find the correction for the logarithm of the complement of the arc by the above process, and then find log (l ir-y) from log y.

In fact y-=230625, and log I =0log 29=0 40330 93959 24. The error is therefore only of three units in the tenth decimal place, where there was no reason to expect accuracy. 26. The only other formulae which I shall give are the following, for finding the logarithm of a number, and vice versd. They are indispensable where more than seven figures are required. Let log (x+h) =log + k, then log k=log (a4 + mnearly, log h =log (Mxk)+ k nearly. The values of log m and log [ have been given in paragraph 23. 27.

I have selected these values because they can be obtained without reduction or interpolation from the Table of A(O, p) which I have given, and also because sin2 a= sin d, and therefore the integral can be reduced to one of the first class, plus an inverse tangent, thus admitting of easy verification.

In order to find how many places ought to have been accurately obtained, I observe that the method followed gives N= 1, r=1, whence log (A v/N) =995491=log sin 640 20' 30". The corresponding meridional parts are 5086 5, which must be multiplied by i=8, giving 40692-0. Referring to the Table in paragraph 14, I find that this nearly corresponds to ten places correct, and therefore that the integral ought to be correct to at least that extent. That it is not so, is due to my having curtailed the formula for finding the logarithms of the inverse tangents. But my object was only to give seven decimals correct, and my going beyond that was simply because, with a ten-figure Table, putting down the additional figures gave me less trouble (once I had to use more than seven) than abbreviation would have done. This remark may at first sight seem strange to any one who has not had some practice in using large Tables. But the logarithmic corrections are given in the shape of arithmetical complements with reference APPLICABLE TO ELLIPTIC AND ULTRA-ELLIPTIC FUNCTIONS., 429 to the 10th figure, therefore, considered as an integer, the index is right as it stands, and we need not bestow thought on the proper placing of the correction, as we must if we use any other number of figures. 29. If we had been content with five decimals, the calculation would have been very easy, for in that case we might have used six-figure logarithms, and have made i 4, thus omitting the terms containing 22?1 and 67o.2.

It is worth while to notice a case which will sometimes occur, namely (using the notation of the last example), that the values may be so selected as to give, for one of the values of k, sin c=sin0.cos t v and thus each of the ter' s into which Szkdp was divided would become infinite. Of course the difficulty is only apparent; for in this case the proper value is Sz2 dp C 2d ) of which the integral may be at once found by differentiating the expression 1intsp SEcTIoN IJL.-Extension of the Method. In respect of rapid approximation and precision of limit, the foregoing processes leave nothing to be desired, as far as concerns the radical of the square root; but they do not go beyond that. Mr. SYLVESTER has given an elegant extension of the method to radicals of a higher index, by means of symmetric functions *. The more general problem before us is that of approximating to the integrals of irrational functions by means of rational substitutions. Let p and 4 be functional symbols, and y a function of z; then, that @(z).Ym and 4(z) :y. should both be approximations to h(z), depends upon y&, approaching unity as, m increases. Assuming that ym and y, are connected by the equation Y.=? m4(m, Y') our problem is to choose + so that, in the first place, the approximation shall be exceedingly rapid, and, in the next place, that p(z).ym and p(z): y. shall both (or at least one of them) be thoroughly manageable, and easily integrable. In the case of the approximants already given, the equation ymY(milii) has been made212 I am acquainted with three general methods which effect the object more or less. The first is the obvious one afforded by the Newtonian approximation to the roots of an equation; viz., let a be a first approximate solution, obtained by trial, of the equation fx = 0, and call f'x the differential coefficient of fx; then a second approximation is* See the Philosophical Magazine for December 1860, Supplementary Number, vol. xx. p. 525, note A. 430 MR.

The third method was suggested to me by Mr. CAYLEY'S remark that Mr. SYLVESTER'S third approximation is a particular case, for n =2, of the common form (of the books on (n-i)N + (n+ 1)an a, approximately, a being a first approximation. In order to gain generality, and thereby symmetry, I shall pass from the particular form /iN to the more general p-'N by the following Lemma: Let N=ao+ax+a2x2+a3x3+. and let X1, x2, X35 X4 .... be determined by the system of equations, N(l?+ ' ) = -al X2) ) a2 .

What these methods all effect is simply a rational approximation to the value of y in du the equation 95(y, z)-=0. Then, making y we have only to integrate in order to find the value of u.

There is one point about these higher approximants, of which a solution, even if accompanied with considerable restrictions, would be extremely desirable,-I mean the resolution of the denominators into factors. I do not suppose that the problem, in its perfectly general form, admits of a compact solution; but any class of cases, of even moderate generality, for which it could be elegantly solved, would probably have very useful applications. The criterion of convergence and the measure of approximation would also have their interest. APPLICABLE TO ELLIPTIC AND 'ULTRA-ELLIPTIC F`UNCTIONS. 433 Specimen sheet of work for the Table.
