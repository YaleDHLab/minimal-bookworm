An Account of a Polypus cough'd up from the Windpipe; in a Letter from the Ingenious Dr. Samber, Physician at Salisbury, to Dr. Jurin, Secr. R. S. T H E 15th of last December at 10 at Night, I was sent for to one Mr. Tompson, an Officer of the Excise in this Town, who was taken with so violent a Flux of Blood, that in a short space of time he lost near three pounds of Blood, as near as we could judge: By the time I came, it was pretty well over; only he seem'd to have something, when he cough'd, that stuck in the Passage, which he could not get up, and by its rattling I thought it very loose. I order'd what I thought proper in such a case,and left him: Next Morning they told me,that half an hour after I was gone, he had cough'd up what they shew'd me on a Sheet of Paper, which Mr Gifford the Apothecary (a very honest Man, and very ingenious in his Business) had desir'd them to keep till I came. Upon putting it into Water, I found it a Polypus; and, as I think, a very remarkable one. I here send you a draught of it Fig. 3. exactly done by a Painter since dead. I could find by my Blow-pipe, that it was hollow; but its being torn off with such violence, has made so many (263) many Holes in it, that it cannot be blown up. You will (I believe) conclude, it ~ the Bronchia, and that the Air had a passage through it, and that a violent Fit of coughing had separated the Adhaesion, and brought on that violent Flux of Blood, &c. He had been tormented with a Cough for more than six Months, was a gouty Man; but after this was cough'd up, and so large an Ulcer made,he had all the successive Symptoms of a fatal Consumption; as Cough, Spitting, Hectick, colliquative Sweats, Diarrhaea, and the 16th of this Month died, Aged near 50.
