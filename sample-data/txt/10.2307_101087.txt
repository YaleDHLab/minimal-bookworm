(2221) Another Extract of a Letter written from Midleton in Warwickshire to the Publisher July 10th. by Francis Willughby Esquire; about the Hatching of a kind of Bee, lodged in Old Willoms. THe Cartrages that I got at Astrop* near a Twelfmonth ago, do now almost every day afford me a Bee; and I can hear them gnawing out their way before I see them: So that there is nothing irregular in the way of breeding of these Bees; But the contrivance of God and Nature in it is very admirable. Having shut their yong ones in those Cels with sufficient provision, they all, as well the uppermost as lowermost, before Winter come to their full growth, or are turn'd into Nympha's' in vvhich condition they are designed to lye all Winter, as the most of Insects do. The next Summer those must necessarily be first excited out of their torpor, and changed into flyers by the external heat and ayr, that lye next it. If any be laid so late, that they have not time enough to come to the state of Nympha's before Winter, they vvill most certainly dye; and then it is no loss nor inconvenience, though their Cells be perforated. * See two Letters concerning this marter, in Numb. 65. of these Transactions. The Scolopendra, spoken of by the German Philosophers in Numb. 8. p.2082. ~. 31. of the Transactions, is that which is our Bruchus, described by Muffet, in the latter part of his Chapter de Julis, p. 202. I saw it in the Cloisters of Trinity Colledge in Cambridge, 12 or 13 years ago. It shall go hard, but I will send you some shortly. I am, &c.
