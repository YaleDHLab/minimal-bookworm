Accounts of a Capricorn Beetle, found alive in a Cavity within a sound Piece of Wood, and of the Horn of a Fish struck several Inches into the Side of a Ship; by C. Mortimer, M. D. Secr. R. S. A B O U T Michaelmas 1728. I went to Portsmouth with some Friends, where having taken a View of his M A J E S T Y ' s Yard and Docks for building Ships of War; and satisfied my Curiosity in examining several curious Contrivances used in Naval Architecture; Mr. Bankley, the Clerk of the Survey, invited me to his House, where he shewed me the Insect as represented in T AB. VIII. Fig. 6. and 7. The People of the Yard were much alarmed at it, none knowing what to make of it; and all imagining it was venomous. On opening the Piece of Wood, (which was tied together with a Packthread) I found this Animal yet alive, and moving in a large Cavity in the Middle of the Wood, which appeared otherwise sound, having no visible Entrance into it. This Beetle, being turned out upon a Sheet of Paper, crawled about upon it. Mr. Bankley gave me the following Account of it: `` This Insect was found August 26. 1728. `` in splitting a Piece of Exotic Wood into Two `` Pieces, cut across the Grain 4 5/8 Inches thick, taken `` up in the Hold of his M A J E S T Y's Ship Bredah, `` when in the Dock at Portsmouth, after her Return `` from the West-Indies: It lived upwards of a Month `` afterwards. The Hole in which it was nourished, 5 T 2 ~ was [862] `` was 5 Inches deep, and 2 1/4 Inches by 1 1/4 Inch `` broad, in the great Piece; 2 Inches deep, and 2 1/4 `` Inches by 1 1/4 Inch broad, in the smaller Piece. `` There was not the least Sign of any Defect on the `` Outside of the Wood, but it appeared very fair and `` sound; the Inside was porous, having a Grain like `` Cedar, but in Colour not unlike yellow Sanders. '' On Examination, I found this Insect to be a sort of Scarabaeus called Capricornus from its long Horns; which in this were very much crumpled, and partly broken off against the Wood, in its Confinement: Its Wings were likewise crumpled on the same Account. The Females of these Insects usually lay their Eggs in the Crevices of the Bark of Trees: So it is probable, that as soon as this Insect was hatched in Form of a Worm, it gnawed its Way through the Bark into the Wood; and that afterwards the Hole it had made in the Wood, closed towards the Outside; and the Worm, still continuing to gnaw deeper, formed the large Cavity; and then taking its perfect Form of a Beetle, remained in that hollow Place, where the Sap of the Tree arising, might have supplied it with Nourishment, and even Air; since it is known, by various Experiments, that Air will insinuate itself, where-ever such Fluids, as contain Air in them, can penetrate. I have seen in the magnificent Museum of Sir Hans Sloane, Bart. a Piece of Wood, sound without, having a Cavity within, wherein was found alive a sort of Beetle, but I think of a different Species. It came from Jamaica, if I remember right. At the same time, that curious Gentleman Mr. Bankley shewed me the Horn of a Fish that had penetrated above 8 Inches into the Timber of a Ship [see T AB. [863] T A B. VIII. Fig. 8.]; and gave me the following Relation of it: `` His M A J E S T Y's Ship Leopard, having `` been at the West-Indies, and on the Coast of `` Guiney, was ordered by Warrant from the Ho`` nourable Navy-Board, dated Aug. 18. 1725. to be `` cleaned and refitted at Portsmouth for Channel`` Service: Pursuant thereto, she was put into the `` great Stone-dock; and, in stripping off her Sheath`` ing, the Shipwrights found something that was `` uncommon~ in her Bottom, about 8 Feet from her `` Keel, just before the Fore-mast; which they search`` ing into, found the Bone or Part of the Horn of `` a Fish of the Figure here described; the Outside `` rough, not unlike Seal-skin; and the End, where `` it was broken off, shewed itself like coarse Ivory. `` The Fish is supposed to have followed the Ship, `` when under Sail, because the sharp End of the `` Horn pointed toward the Bow: It penetrated with `` that Swiftness or Strength, that it went through `` the Sheathing 1 Inch thick, the Plank 3 Inches `` thick, and into the Timber 4 1/2 Inches. '' With what prodigious Force must this Fish have moved? For had it met the Ship, the Motion of the Ship would have assisted the Penetration of the Horn; but the Direction of it pointing from the Stern towards the Head, shews that the Fish struck against the Ship, either while at Anchor; or that it overtook it, while under Sail; in which case the Force of the Fish must have been still greater; and this was probably the Case, because nobody in the Ship remembered the Shock. Several able Workmen on the Spot assured me, that, with a Hammer of a Quarter of an Hundred Weight, they could not drive in a Pin of Iron, of the same Form and Size, into such sort [864] sort of Wood, and to the same Depth, in less than Eight or Nine Strokes.
