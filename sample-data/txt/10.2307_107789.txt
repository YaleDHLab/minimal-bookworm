[ 339 1 XXVIII. On the geometrical representation of the powers of quantities, whose indices involve the square roots of negative quantities. By the Rev. JOHN WARREN, M.A. late Fellow and Tutor of Jesus College, Cambridge. Communicated by the President. Read June 4, 1829. ABOUT three months ago I wrote a paper intitled " Consideration of the objections raised against the geometrical representation of the square roots of negative quantities," which paper was communicated to the Royal Society by Dr. YOUNG, and read on the 19th of February last. At that time I had only discovered the manner of representing geometrically quantities of the form a + b j 1, and of geometrically adding and multiplying such quantities, and also of raising them to powers, either whole or fractional, positive or negative; but I was not then able to represent geometrically quantities of the form a + b y/-1 that is, quantities raised to powers, whose indices involve the square roots of negative quantities. My attention, however, has since been drawn to these latter quantities in consequence of an observation which I met with in M. MOUREY'S work on this subject (the work which I mentioned in my former paper); the observation is as follows: "Les limites dans lesquelles je me suis restreint m'ont force 'a passer sous silence plusieurs espbces de formules, telles sont celles-ci a ,a sin (a1-i) &c., &c., &c. Je les discute amplement dans mon grand ouvrage, et je d6montre que toutes expriment des lignes directives situ6es sur le meme plan que I et 1." where a and 1 in M. MOUREY'S notation signify respectively a (1) /4 and (1)4 according to my notation. 2 x2 340 MR. WARREN ON GEOMETRICAL REPRESENTATION From this observation it was evident that M. MOUREY had arrived at the geometrical representation of all algebraic quantities whatever, and that in a larger work he entered fully into the subject; but from his Preface it appeared also, that this larger work existed only in manuscript, and that circumstances would not permit the author to publish it at present. I was induced therefore to pursue my own investigations further; and the result was, that I found (as M. MOUREY had stated) that all algebraic quantities whatever are capable of geometrical representation, and are represented by lines all situated in the same plane: and my view in what I am now writing is to communicate this result to algebraists. This paper, therefore, is intended as a continuation of my " Treatise on the geometrical representation of the square roots of negative quantities ;" and the object of it is to extend the geometrical representation to the powers of quantities, whose indices involve the square roots of negative quantities. Art. 1. Def.) Mathematicians apply the words ' possible' and ' impossible' to algebraic quantities, the former signifying either positive or negative quantities; the latter, quantities involving the square roots of negative quantities. In this sense, as a matter of convenience, these words will be used in this paper; it being understood at the same time that by the word 'impossible' no impossibility is necessarily implied, but on the contrary, that the quantities called impossible have a real existence, and are capable of geometric representation. 2. Def.) Logarithms, according to the common definition given by mathematicians, must be possible quantities; therefore as a general definition of logarithms will be given in this paper, it will be desirable for the sake of distinction to give a more limited name to the common definition of logarithms, and accordingly they will be called possible logarithms; also for the like reason, the powers of quantities according to the common definition of powers, will be called possible powers. 3. Def.) Let ? be any quantity whatever, and let ? be inclined to unity at an angle = 0, and let r be a positive quantity equal in length to A, and let the possible hyperbolic logarithm of r be v; then v + d I/-1 is called the general hyperbolic logarithm of A, and expressed thus i'.

Let E be a quantity such that E' = 1, and let e be any quan0 tity whatever; then?' general logarithm of g in a system whose base is E. 0o 342 MR. WARREN ON GEOMETRICAL REPRESENTATION For, let v = general logarithm of g in a system whose base is E, 0 then (by Art. 11.) v Ei l = 0 14. Cor. 3.) Hence the quantity E in the preceding article is the base of 0 the system of general hyperbolic logarithms. 15. Def.) Let a and m be any quantities whatever, and let ? be a quantity such that one of its general logarithms in a system, whose base is a, is m; then ? is called the mth general power of a, and expressed thus a; and the mth general power of a is expressed thus (a)".

Let a be any quantity whatever, and let b be a positive quantity in length equal to a, and let a be inclined to unity at an angle _ a, where a is positive and less than c the circumference of the circle, and let g _ (a) f, then, if m be a possible quantity, g will be in length = and will be indined to unity at an angle m . a + p c . 1/-*.

Let a be a positive quantity, and let g be the mth possible power of a; then e will also be the my general power of a. a For since a is a positive quantity, and g the m th possible power of a, (by a Treatise, Art. 65.) ? is a positive quantity; Also, from the nature of possible logarithms, since g is the mth possible power of a; possible hyperbolic logarithm of e = m x possible hyperbolic logarithm 0 of a, that is (by Art. 9.) a' = m a, (by Art. 15.) g is the mth general power of a. 19. Let a be any quantity whatever, and let g be the mt"l possible power of a, then g will also be the mt" general power of a. For let b be a positive quantity, in length = a, and let a be inclined to unity at an angle _, a being positive and less than c the circumference of the circle, ilen, since g is the mlth possible power of a, p (by Treatise, Art. 59, 60.) length of e = mth possible power of b (by Art. 18.) b And (by Treatise, Art. 63, 64.) g is inclined to unity at an angle = m a o + p c; (by Art. 17.) g is the Mth general power of a. p 20.

If a be any quantity whatever, and a' = n n being i P 0 positive and m possible; and if a logarithmic spiral be described having its pole in the origin of a, and cutting the positive direction at a distance = I and passing through the extremity of a in its p + li revolution; then the spiral will cUt its radii at an angle = m. 50.

Hence if a be a positive quantity, and p 0, the spiral, in which a is, will become a straight line, and the spiral, in which g is, will be perpendicular to it, that is, will be a circle but if a = I, and p be not = 0, the spiral, in which a is, will become a circle, and the spiral, in which g is, will be perpendicular to it, that is, will be a straight line, and g will be a positive quantity. 53.

With respect to quantities such as sin (a + bj c-1)cos (a + b -1), &c., quantities strictly speaking not algebraic, it may be observed, that if it be found useful to introduce these quantities into algebra, they may without im propriety be introduced, by giving to sines, cosines, &c., algebraic definitions; thus sin A may be defined to signify A -A ( c(i) C (E)Av/(Ej-Av -I 01 2V1 Iand we shall have (Ej)U/1_b (E)-aV -+b (Ey-.
