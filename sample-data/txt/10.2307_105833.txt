[253] XXXV. Observations made on the Island of Hammerfost, for the Royal Society. By Jeremiah Dixon. A J O U R N A L of my O B S E R V A T I O N S at H A M M E R F O S T. 1769. ~ May 7 At half past 10 A. M. anchored in HammerfostBay, near the town of Hammerfost, on Hammerfost-Island. In the afternoon went on shore, to find a proper place to observe in; but found none. ~ 8 Went on shore again, to find a place; and, after much search and travel, fixed upon one: but, though the best this or the adjacent islands could afford, is very difficult of access. ~ 9 Landed the house and observatory. ~ 10 Digging holes for fixing the clock-post, and stand for the transit-instrument. Note, the ground so much frozen and rocky, could not finish them this day. 4 The [254] 1769. ~ May 10 The carpenters, this day, put up the house, separate from the observatory; as there was not room left by the carpenter at Greenwich for fixing the transit-instrument. ~ 11 Finished the digging, and fixed up the post for the clock; also put up that part of the observatory which moves round. Note, the post for the clock was 3 feet deep in the ground. ~ 12 Carried the instruments on shore: the carpenters working at the observatory. ~ 13 Fixed up the clock, and set it a-going. Note, The upper part of the bob of the pendulum was set to scratch, marked thus ~ and the index to No 14. It vibrated on each side of the perpendicular 1~ 30~. ~ 14 Put up the quadrant. It was placed upon the stand provided for it. The stand stood on a large cask filled with water, very firmly fixed in the ground; and the box in the bottom of the stand filled with stones. Cloudy weather. Placed one thermometer without doors, and the other within the observatory; also placed the barometer in a proper place. Cloudy till ~ May 20, in the evening; when I took the following equal altitudes of the Sun. May~ [255] Point on ~ May 20 Sun West. Sun East. the quaL. limb. Up. limb. Up. limb.

The mark 8~ is distant about 2 1/2 miles, and that No about 2 miles. The situation would not allow me to have marks nearer. Put the clock forward, to be nearer the right ascension of the mid-heaven. This afternoon came on a most violent storm of wind~ hail, and snow, which continued till Tuesday evening. ~ 23 Cloudy, with snow, &c. ~ 24 Ditto.

Hazy. The mean 4h 46~ 3~. Hence the clock is 11~,13 slow of sidereal time, and loses at the rate of 6~,84 per day. By [259] By comparing the instant of time 16h 44~ 3~,42 per clock the Sun passed the meridian under the Pole on the 2d of June, with the instant 16h 44~ 22~ 05 per clock, it passed the meridian mark per transit instrument, I find it is 18~,63 later per transit, that is, the mark northward stands 18~,63 too much to the east. Now by putting up another mark at the same distance as the first, so as to correspond to the second wire, and measuring the distance between this and the first mark, I find it to be 36 feet. This increased in the ratio of the zen. dist. 86~ 48~ to rad. gives 36,057 feet for the space corresponding to 45~1/2, the time of the Sun's passage from the second to the third or middle wire. The reason of this increase is, that all the wires in a transit instrument, except the middle one, describe lesser circles, parallel to the middle one, which describes an azimuth.-Having got what space corresponds to 45~1/2, we have, by proportion, 14,76 feet for the space, answering to 18~,63, which the mark must be moved westward to be in the true meridian.
