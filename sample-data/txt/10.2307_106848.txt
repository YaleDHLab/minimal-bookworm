[427] XXIII. On the Satellites of the Planet Saturn, and the Rotation of its Ring on an Axis. By William Herschel, LL.D. F. R. S. Read June 17, 1790. IN my last Paper on the Planet Saturn, the principal object of which was to give an immediate account of the most interesting phaenomena that had occurred till the beginning of November, many things were left unnoticed for want of time to treat of them with sufficient accuracy; but having now before me the whole series of observations from the 18th of July till the 25th of December, 1789, I can enter into a proper examination, assisted by such necessary calculations as then could not conveniently be made. One of the principal motives which have induced me to hasten this inquiry, is the frequent appearance of protuberant and lucid points on the arms of the ring of Saturn. I have mentioned before that such phaenomena had been resolved by the situation of satellites that put on these appearances; but as my observations were continued near two months afterwards, and as I had from them corrected the epochae of the old satellites, and improved the tables of the new ones, I found that, besides many of these bright points which were completely accounted for by the calculated places of the satellites, there were also many more mentioned in my journal that would not accord with the situation of any of them. K k k 2 The 428 Dr. HERSCHEL'S Observations on the The question then presented itself very naturally, what to make of these protuberant points? To admit two or three more satellites by way of solving such phaenomena appeared to me too hazardous an hypothesis; especially as these lucid points, though some of them had a motion, did not seem willing to conform to the criterion I had before used of coming off the ring, and shewing themselves as satellites. And yet a suspicion of at least one more satellite would often return; it was even considerably strengthened when I discovered, by means of re-calculating with great precision the whole series of observations, that in the beginning of the season there had been some few mistakes in the names of the satellites, when the observations of them were entered in the journal. In setting them right, which threw a great light upon the revolution of the 6th, and more especially upon that of the 7th, I found also, that some of the observations which were entered by the name of the 7th satellite could not belong to that, nor to any other known one. It remained therefore to be examined whether there might not be sufficient ground to suspect the existence of an eighth satellite. In this situation of things, I thought it most advisable to draw out the whole series of observations in a paper, beginning at the 5th satellite, and thus gradually through the 4th, 3d, 2d, 1st, 6th, and 7th, to approach towards the center of Saturn; that it might appear at last what observations were left unaccounted for. By this means also it will be seen clearly with how scrupulous an attention the identity of every satellite has been ascertained; and with a view to give the strongest satisfaction in this respect, at least one observation of each has been calculated for each night; and the place thus computed is put Satellites of the Planet Saturn. 429 put down in the notes, that it may be compared with the observed one. To facilitate this comparison, I have delineated a scheme *, wherein the orbits of the satellites are drawn in their due proportion. A few words will explain the construction and use of this figure, which, notwithstanding its simplicity, is yet amply sufficient to ascertain the accuracy of every observation. In each of the orbits, by way of marking them, is placed the satellite to which it belongs, as it appeared to be situated the 18th of October, 1789. The graduated circle is of use to find, by means of the tables, the apparent place of a satellite for any given time; or, the apparent situation of the same satellite being given, its real Saturnicentric place may be deduced from it. In the center of the scheme is the planet Saturn, and its ring, expressed by a line which represents the direction of its ansae; or the ring itself, as it appeared in my telescopes during the months of July, August, September, October, and November, 1789. The five lines which are carried on parallel to each other serve to convey the measure of the planet, and its ring, to the orbits of the satellites, as will be seen in several instances that occur hereafter. The graduated circle is divided into degrees, and begins to count from that part of every satellite's orbit beyond the planet, which is intercepted by a plane passing from the eye of the observer, at rectangles to the ring, through the center of Saturn. Hence it follows, that the point of zero, or 360 degrees, is the same with the geocentric place of the planet in those four parts of the orbit of the satellite where the eye is in the plane of the ring, and where it appears the most open; and that, in other places, it may be had by solving one spherical triangle. This is to be understood as relating only to * See Tab. XIX. fig 1. the 430 Dr. HERSCHEL'S Observations on the the inner satellites; the 5th, or outermost, requiring a different reduction, on account of its deviation from the plane of the ring. Moreover, I am inclined to believe, that the surest way of observing the 5th, is to trust only to measures, taken with micrometers which give the distance and angle of position, except in such cases when the eye is nearly in the plane of this satellite's orbit, where the different reductions may be neglected, without bringing on any considerable inaccuracies. The order of the numbers by which 90 comes to the left, and 270 to the right, is taken from the motion of the satellites, as they appear to revolve in their orbits, when seen in telescopes of my construction; and which is also the real direction of their motion according to the order of the signs. But the points 360 and 180 must occasionally be changed in their denomination of north or south, according to the real situation of the plane of each satellite's orbit. At present, for instance, when the satellites are at 360, that part of their orbits in which we find them lies to the south of the center of the planet; but about the end of August, 1789, and afterwards, the orbits of the six inner satellites were differently situated; so that the same points then were turned towards the north. I need not remark, that the situation of these points was changed again when the earth passed through the plane of the ring, and that it will change, in the 5th satellite likewise, when we come to be in the plane of its orbit. The calculations of the places of all the satellites have been made according to tables which are given at the end of this Paper. Their form being very simple, I thought it not amiss to communicate them, for the use of those who may wish to enter into a more particular examination of the following observations; or to follow the satellites in their orbits at any 1 future Satellites of the Planet Saturn. 431 future time. It will be proper to mention, that I have deduced the epochae of all the seven satellites from my own observations, and they will be found to differ considerably from those which are given by M. DE LA LANDE, in the Connoissance des Temps for 1791. But I have not attempted to extend them farther than a few years backwards or forwards, as I am not in possession of any observations that could authorize me to undertake such a work. On the contrary, I am well convinced, that no tables will give us the situation of the satellites accurately, till we have at least established the dimensions of their elliptical orbits, and the motion as well as the situation of their aphelia. The epochae for 1789, therefore, must be looked upon not as mean ones, but such as respect the orbits of these satellites in their situation during the time of the following observations; and the two preceding, and two following years, must be already a little affected with those errors which are the necessary consequence of our not knowing the required elements. I flatter myself, however, that the observations, which are delivered in this Paper, will serve as a beginning to a proper foundation for investigating them. The many conjunctions between the satellites, for instance, will undoubtedly throw some light on the situation and excentricity of their orbits; as it will be found, that the calculated places of these conjunctions require elliptical motions to bring the satellites to such appearances, which, in circular orbits, could not so accurately have taken place. Nor can we ascribe the disagreements to the fault of the observations, since a very few minutes will suffice to determine the time of a conjunction, which never lasts long. For this reason also, I have carefully avoided deducing my epochae from conjunctions, even with the 6th satellite, 432. Dr. HERSCHEL'S Observations on the satellite, which moves so rapidly that, at first sight, we might think those situations favourable. The mean motion of the five old satellites, as being sufficiently accurate for my present purpose, I have taken from the above-mentioned tables of M. DE LA LANDE; and those of the 6th and 7th, of course, are the result of my own observations. The geocentric place of Saturn, whose complement is to be added, in order to reduce the Saturnicentric situation of the satellites to the apparent one, I have taken from the nautical almanac to the nearest minute; and, as I have always confined myself to a literal transcription of the observations from the original journal, all the memorandums which are necessary either to explain them, or to correct mistakes in the names of the satellites, are thrown into notes, that there may be no interruption in the succession of the observations.

July (A) The time of my observations being sidereal, it is necessary to mention, that this relates only to the hours, minutes, and seconds, the day itself being that which is generally used by astronomers, beginning at noon, and ending the noon following. By this means there can never be a mistake which sidereal hour I mean to point out, as no two such hours can occur in the same astronomical night. It will also be necessary to remark, that all the times are those shewn by the clock; which, by equal altitudes, has been found to lose very equally at the rate of 0'',4 per day; and to be 8'51'',5 too fast at midnight the 18th of July, 1789, which is the time on which my observations on Saturn commenced.

The supposed 5th is a very little preceding a line drawn from the large star of last night, through a very small star; and a good deal following a line drawn from the that the satellite in the first place was at the preceding side of the planet; that is, in the semicircle from 180 to 360, which passes through 270 degrees. And in the next, that the situation of its orbit was such as to bring the satellite, at its proper distance, into a line drawn from the center of Saturn, making an angle of 6 or 7 degrees with the line of the ring, and declining towards the south.

(H) It appears from the calculation for 14 h. 48' 29'' which gives 74o,2, and also from the following observations, that this was the real 5th satellite; and that, having once obtained its place, I kept it in view all the rest of the season.

I have used this observation for settling the epocha of this satellite, in which I have made no other allowance than that of the geocentric place of Saturn, as I knew this would answer all my purposes. But when we would obtain the mean motion of this satellite in comparing its present place with other situations at a great distance of time, proper reductions of the geocentric place of ~ to the orbit of this satellite should be made. This may, however, be done much better when the real situation of its orbit is properly ascertained. h. ' '' o h. ' '' o (T) 9 1 59. 183,8. (V) 10 29 52. 193~,3. (W) 7 31 25. 197,4.

I conclude from this that some particular cause must have rendered it invisible. Most probably it suffered an occultation from the 1st satellite, which was situated in such a manner as nearly to cover it the whole evening; in this case, the observation of the 1st belongs also to the 2d, since their diameters would certainly run together so as, perhaps, if the occultation was not always central, to form only one satellite, of rather a larger diameter than either of them. h. h. ~ ~ o ~ ~ o (A) 7 1 39. 42,4.

The following part of the ring of Saturn, which is a very thin lucid line, ends in a bright point like a very faint satellite (A). I suppose the bright point on the f. part of the ring to be a very small fixed star (B). 20 14. The bright point on the following part of R. seems to have its whole dia. towards the north; and in all appearance adheres to the line. 0 48. Possibly the bright point on the nf. part of the ring may be one of the satellites, and one of the before supposed satellites may be a small fixed star (C). (Y) 6 h. 7' 58''. 307o,8. (A) 11 h 52' 21''. 146,7. This shews, that the bright point was the 1st satellite. (B) Being the first night of my viewing the satellites this year, their places were unknown. The 6th, which was in view, I took for the 1st satellite; but, the 2d, 3d, and 4th being also before me, there remained only the supposition of some small fixed star to account for the bright point. (C) The motion of the bright point on the ring led me to the supposition of its being a satellite; and, to make room for one, it occurred, that one of the others might be a star: for still the thought of an unknown satellite did not happen to strike me. I should have made an attempt to calculate the places of the satellites by the manuscript tables of M. DE LA LANDE, which are now printed in the Connoissance des Temps for 1791; but as there chanced to be an erratum of one day's motion in the epochae of all the satellites for 1788, of which I was not aware, I had so little satisfaction from them the year before, that I laid them by as useless, and resolved to investigate the epochae and revolutions of the satellites from my own observations. 21 15.

The 6th a little more than 1/2 projection f. the edge. 13 h. 8' 59'', which gives 243o,7, shews that these observations belong to the 6th; and therefore explains all the difficulty about the supposed change of magnitude of the 3d.

The satellite seems to be clear of the projection; but I can see no division yet; its whole dia. seems to be to the south; I see it full as well as I saw the 6th, or rather better (T). 1 35.

The 6th sat. will be in conjunction with the 3d in a very short time, the 3d being still a little p. 22 39. The conjunction is so complete now, that I have lost the 6th. The 3d, however, appears to be a little lengthened out towards the south. Distance of the conjoined satellites (R) 11h. 12' 52''. 67o,7. (S) There were five observations made upon the 6th satellite, but they belong to the 7th. There were also three observations made upon the 7th which belong to the 6th, and are here given; we are to observe, that the revolution of the 7th was not yet ascertained, and that, consequently, a mistake of one new satellite for another could easily be made. (T) 11h. 43' 53''. 220o,9.

A second new satellite excessively faint, 1/2 projection p. the edge of the R. (C). 22 55. The new, or 7th sat. 1/4 projection p. R. so excessively small that, if I had not seen it before, it would have been impossible to perceive it now. (A) Not being acquainted with more than six satellites, and having the 2d, 3d, 4th, 5th, and 6th in view, it was natural enough to call the remaining one, on which this observation is made, the 1st; but from the note M of the 1st sat. it appears, that it could not be in the place where this was seen; and by calculating from the tables of the 7th sat. we have its place for 11h. 28' 45''. 106o,0, which agrees exactly with the situation pointed out. From a figure, it appears, that the sat~ was extremely small, and less than half its diameter south of the line of the R. (B) I was now on the look-out for very small stars that were in any situation likely to be satellites of ~, and always noticed them: for instance, `` Sept. 11. `` 20 h. 42'. A supposed 7th sat. exactly in the line of the R. or a very little `` south, excessively faint, only to be seen when I hide ~ by the field bar. Sept. `` 14. 20 h. 40'. The 7th of Sept. 11. is left in its place.'' So here this supposed 7th is marked down, and Sept. 16. 20 h. 13' I find it is said, that `` the `` supposed 7th of the 14th is a small fixed star, left in the place where it was that `` evening; but as the configuration of stars which pointed out this supposed 7th was very coarse, and hardly sufficient to determine the place, and as by calculation it appears, that the 7th satellite was in the situation where this observation places it, at 13 h. 59' 43'', viz. 278o,2, it is probable enough, that I saw the real satellite this evening.

I see six satellites at once, and being perfectly assured that the 2d is invisible, it becomes evident that Saturn has seven satellites. This new sat. is excessively small. Sept. 18. 22 4. The new sat. near 1/2 projection p. R. and a little south, but so faint that I hardly perceive it (D). 22 36. I cannot perceive the new satellite with the utmost attention (E). Indeed it was so faint before, that I almost entertained a doubt of its reality. Sept. 25. 23 48. The 7th sat. I believe is between the 6th and the R. or 1/3 projection f. the edge (F). 23 52. I see it very plainly; it is much smaller than the 6th; I have many times this evening before suspected it, but the weather has been too hazy. Oct. 12. 22 6. The sixth sat.

The sixth being nearer to Saturn on the f. side than the 1st on the preceding, must be quite close to the f. projection, or touching it. (D) 10 h. 2' 37''. 303o5.

From the observations on the seven satellites of Saturn that have been here delivered, and closely compared with their calculated places, it appears evidently that the revolutions of these satellites are so well ascertained, that we may, without hesitation, determine that no phaenomenon on the ring of Saturn, in the shape of lucid spot, protuberant point, or latent satellite, can be occasioned by any of them, when, upon computation, we find that the place of the satellite differs from that where such appearances were observed. In consequence of this deduction, I found, that the observations, which will be given presently, could not be explained by any of the known satellites; it remained, therefore, to be examined to what cause to ascribe the appearance of such lucid spots. The first idea that occurred was that of another satellite, still closer to the ring than the seventh; and if a revolution, slower than about 15 hours and a quarter, could have been found, which would have taken in the most material places in which bright spots were seen, I should have continued of opinion that an eighth satellite, exterior to the ring, did exist, notwithstanding more observations had been wanting to put the matter out of all doubt. But this being impracticable, I examined, in the next place, what would be the result if these supposed satellites, or protuberant points, were attached to the plane or edge of the ring. (X) 6h. 41' 59''. 100o,0. As Rotation of the Ring of Saturn. 479 As observations, carefully made, should always take the lead of theories, I shall not be concerned if such lucid spots as I am now going to admit, should seem to contradict what has been said in my last Paper, concerning the idea of inequalities, or protuberant points. We may however remark, that a lucid, and apparently protuberant point, may exist without any great inequality in the ring. A vivid light, for instance, will seem to project greatly beyond the limits of the body upon which it is placed. If therefore the luminous places on the ring should be such as proceed from very bright reflecting regions, or, which is more probable, owe their existence to the more fluctuating causes, of inherent fires acting with great violence, we need not imagine the ring of Saturn to be very uneven or distorted, in order to present us with such appearances as will be related. In this sense of the word, then, we may still oppose the idea of protuberant points, such as would denote immense mountains of elevated surface. On comparing together several observations, a few trials shew that the brightest and best observed spot agrees to a revolution of 10h. 32' 15'',4; and, calculating its distance from the center of Saturn on a supposition of its being a satellite, we find it 17'', 227, which brings it upon the ring. It is therefore certain, that unless we should imagine the ring to be sufficiently fluid to permit a satellite to revolve in it, or suppose a notch, groove, or division in the ring, to suffer the satellite to pass along, we ought to admit a revolution of the ring itself. The density of the ring indeed may be supposed to be very inconsiderable by those who imagine its light to be rather the effect of some shining fluid, like an aurora borealis, than a reflection from some permanent substance; but its disapparition in general, and in my telescopes its faintness when turned edge5 ways, 480 Dr. HERSCHEL'S Observations on the ways, are in no manner favourable to this idea. When we add also, that this ring casts a deep shadow upon the planet, is very sharply defined both in its outer and inner edge, and in brightness exceeds the planet itself, it seems to be almost proved, that its consistence cannot be less than that of the body of Saturn; and that consequently, no degree of fluidity can be admitted sufficient to permit a revolving body to keep in motion for any considerable time. A groove might afford a passage, especially as on a former occasion we have already considered the idea of a divided ring. A circumstance also which seems rather to favour this idea is, that, in some observations, a bright spot has been seen to project equally on both sides, as the satellites have been observed to do when they passed behind the ring. But, on the other hand, we ought to consider that the spot has often been observed very near the end of the arms of Saturn's ring, and that the calculated distance is consequently a little too small for such appearances, and ought to be 19 or 20 seconds at least. We should also attend to the size of the spot, which seems to be variable; for it is hardly to be imagined that a satellite, brighter than the sixth, and which could be seen with the moon nearly at the full, should so often escape our notice in its frequent revolutions, unless it varied much in its apparent brightness. To this we must add another argument drawn from the number of lucid spots, which will not agree with the motion of one satellite only; whereas, by admitting a revolution of the ring itself, in 10 h. 32' 15'',4; and supposing all the spots to adhere to the ring, and to share in the same periodical return, provided they last long enough to be seen many times, we Rotation of the Ring of Saturn. 481 we shall be able to give an easy solution to all the remaining observations. For instance, let ~, ~, ~, ~, ~, represent five spots on the ring of Saturn, situated as in fig. 2.; where the ring is supposed to be divided into 360 degrees, and the spot ~ placed at 271o,5; ~ at 70o,2; ~ at 183o,0; ~ at 142o,5; and ~ at 358o,6. Then will the ring, with the spots thus placed, serve as an epocha for the year 1789; by which, with the assistance of a table constructed upon the before-mentioned period of the rotation of the ring, we may calculate their situation for any required time; and to render this calculation perfectly convenient, I have given a table, ready prepared for the purpose, at the end of the other tables. The following observations have all been previously calculated by the tables of such of the seven satellites as were not already in view, and have been found to belong to neither of them; but in the notes that are given with them they have been again calculated by the table of the rotation of the ring for every time they were observed, on a supposition of their being spots adhering to it. Observations not accounted for by satellites. July 28. 22 31. I now perceive between the nearest sat. and ~, on the s. side, a small lucid point, like an emerging satellite (A). 22 37. (A) My surmise of its being an emerging satellite so early as the beginning of the season, when I was still unacquainted with the minute phaenomena that offered themselves afterwards, shews plainly, that the lucid point was of a sufficient brightness to deserve notice. The five old satellites were in view, and the VOL. LXXX. R r r 6th 482 Dr. HERSCHEL'S Observations on the 22 37. The last discovered point, not quite half-way between the 3d sat. and the body of Saturn; may be it is a 6th sat. By a figure, the greatest part of its diameter is to the north of the ring (B).

I cannot perceive the satellite on the preceding arm suspected at 20 h. 58' (G). 6th and 7th by calculation could not occasion this appearance, the former being at 72o,3; the latter on the opposite side at 299o,4. Supposing this, therefore, to be the spot I have called ~, its place for 13 h. 53' 39'' would be 36o,8; which might make it appear like an emerging satellite. (B) By this time the spot was at 40o,3, which agrees with the observed situation. As the greatest part of its diameter appeared to be north, we may surmise, that the spot, which must have been of a very considerable size and brightness, was situated on the northern plane of the ring, and within a second or two from the outward edge of it. The ring itself was now so near having its edge directed towards us, that it required no great elevation of the spot to render it visible, notwithstanding it was then in the farthest part of its circuit. (C) The spot ~, at 12 h. 17' 58'' was 301o,5. (D) The spot ~, at 7 h. 45' 52'' was 58o,1. This spot was probably also on the northern plane, and on the very edge, but not so considerable as ~. (E) It was now advanced to 73o,4. (F) The spot ~, at 7 h. 10' 49'' was 305o,0. Its situation on the ring was probably on the southern plane, and at some considerable distance from the outward edge. (G) It was now advanced to 328o,3; and therefore could hardly be seen any longer. Oct. Rotation of the Ring of Saturn. 483 Oct. 16. 1 29.

The great accordance between the observed places of these spots and the calculated ones, seems to establish the rotation of the ring of Saturn on an axis so as hardly to leave any doubt upon the subject. The time of it, we have already seen, is 10 hours, 32 minutes, and 15,4 seconds. It may be objected, (O) The spot ~, at 6 h. 5' 40'', was at 59o,1. (P) The spot ~, at 8 h. 52' 10'', was at 68o,6.

It may be expected, that having now sufficiently examined the whole series of observations of the last new satellites, we can give their periodical times and distances more accurately than before. The times, indeed, are full as well ascertained as we can expect to have them: for on calculating six satellites by my tables back to Aug. 19 d. 12 h. 19' 56'', 1787, we find their places 341o,1 the 5th; 10~,6 the 4th; 211o,1 the 3d; 158o,9 the 2d; 80o,2 the 1st; and 288o,8 the 6th. And my journal contains the fullest assuracne that they were thus situated at the time for which this calculation is made. We may therefore fix the period of the sixth at 1 d. 8 h. 53' 8'',9. The 7th satellite can only be traced back as far as the 8th of Sept. 1789; so that its revolution will require at least another season to come to some degree of accuracy, till when we shall state it at 22 h. 37' 22'',9. The distance of these satellites, deduced from calculation, depends intirely upon the time and distance of the 4th, which is the satellite that has been used. In order to obtain more accuracy in these elements, I have applied myself to measuring the distance of the 4th satellite in those moments which were most favourable for the purpose. It is well known that this subject, on account of the quantity of matter in Saturn, to be deduced from the periodical times and distances of the satellites, is of considerable importance to astronomers; I shall 7 therefore 488 Dr. HERSCHEL'S Tables for the therefore defer a full investigation of it till I can have an opportunity of calculating a great number of measures, not only of the 4th and 5th, but also of the other satellites which I have already by me, and still intend next season to take. Mean while, having brought the measures of the 30th of November, which seem to me to be very good ones, to the mean distance of Saturn from the sun, I find they give the distance of the 4th satellite from Saturn 3' 8'',918. In reducing these measures to the mean distance, I have used the new tables of M. DE LAMBRE for Saturn, and MAYER'S for the sun. Admitting therefore the above quantity as the distance, and 15 d. 22 h. 41' 13'',4 as the period of the 4th satellite, we compute that the distance of the 6th from the center of Saturn is 36'',7889; and that of the 7th, 28'',6689.
