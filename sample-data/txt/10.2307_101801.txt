Observations of some Animals, and of a strange Plant, made in a Voyage into the Kingdom of Congo: by Michael Angelo de Guattini and Dionysius of Placenza, Missionaries thither. Extracted out of the Journal des Scavans. IN Braseil, there are certain little Animals, by the Author call'd Poux de Pharaon, which enter into the feet betwixt the skin and the flesh. They grow in one day as big as Beans. And if they are not presently drawn out, they 6 N make (978) make an unsupportable Ulcer, and all the foot corrupts. In the Kingdom of Congo, there are Serpents twenty five foot long, whichwill swallow at once a whole Sheep. The manner of taking them is thus: When they lie to digest what they have eaten, they stretch themselves forth in the Sun: which the Blacks seeing, kill them. And having cut off their Head and Tail, and embowel'd them, they eat them; and ordinarily find them as fat as Hogs. There are here a great number of Ants, and of that bigness, that the Author reports, that being one day sick in his bed, he was forced to order himself to be carried out of his room for fear of being devoured by them. As it often happens to those of Angola: where you may also find in the morning, the Skelitons of Cows devoured by these Ants in one night. Amongst other fair Fruit Trees in Brazeil there is one, whose Fruit is called Niceffo: which hath this remarkable, that it hath but two Leaves; whereof each is able to cover a man.
