The Motion of Projectiles near the Earth's Surface consider'd, independent of the Properties of the Conic Sections; in a Letter to Martin Folkes Esquire, Pr. R. S. by Mr. Tho. Simpson F. R. S.. A F T E R so much as has been already said upon the Motion of Projectiles in vacuo, it may seem needless to attempt any thing further on that Head; nevertheless, as a thorough Knowledge in the Art of Gunnery is become more than Read Feb. 4. 1747. [138] than ever necessary, and as Gentlemen employ'd in the Practice of that Art are (I am sensible) too often deterr'd from applying themselves to the Theory, by the Difficulties they imagine they shall meet with in the Conic Sections, you will, I hope, pardon the Liberty I have taken, in troubling you with my Thoughts on a Subject, in which little or nothing new is to be expected besides the Method. When I first drew up this Paper (which was about two Years ago) I did intend, had Health permitted me to make the proper Experiments, to have also attempted something with respect to the Resistance of the Atmosphere, whereof the Effects are indeed too considerable to be intirely disregarded: But if the Amplitude of the Projection, answering to one given Elevation, be first determined by Experiment (which our Method supposes) the Amplitudes in all other Cases, where the Elevations and Velocities do not very much differ from the first, may be determined, by the Proportions here laid down, to a sufficient Degree of Exactness: Because, in all such Cases, the Effects of the Resistance will be nearly as the Amplitudes themselves; and were they accurately so, the Proportions of the Amplitudes, at different Elevations, would be exactly the same as in vacuo; which Proportions I now proceed to determine. P R O B L E M I. Let two Balls be projected with the same Celerity, at different, but given Elevations, 'tis proposed to determine the Ratio of the Times of their Flight, [139] Flight, of thoir greatest Altitudes, and of their horizontal Amplitudes. Let P q (Fig. 1.) represent the Plane of the Horizon, P E Q and peq the Paths of the Projectiles, described in the Flight; moreover let QPT and qpt be the given Angles of Elevation, and let P Q and pq be bisected in H and h; drawing HE, QT, he and qt, all perpendicular to Pq; and making the Sine of QPT = S, its Co-sine = C, the Sine qpt = s, its Co-sine = c, and Radius = r. Therefore, since the Distances descended by heavy Bodies (whether from a Point at Rest, or from the right Lines in which they would move, if not acted upon by Gravity) are known to be as the Squares of the Times, QT will be to qt, as the Square of the Time of describing PEQ (or of that wherein the Ball would move uniformly over the Space PT with its first Velocity at P) is to the Square of the Time of describing peq (or of that wherein the other Ball would move uniformly thro' the Length pt). But the Celerities at P and p being equal, by Hypothesis, the Times in which the said Lines PT and pt would be uniformly described, are manifestly, as the Lines themselves: Whence the Squares of those Lines must, also, be as the Squares of the Times, and, consequently, as the Distances descended: that is, Pt2: pt2:: TQ: tq. Now, by Plane Trigonometry TQ = S ~ PT/r and tq = s ~ pt/r; therefore PT2: pt2 (:: S ~ PT/r: s ~ pt/r):: S ~ PT: s ~ pt; whence, by dividing the Antecedents T by [140] by PT, and the Consequents by pt, we have PT. pt:: S: s; from which it appears, that the Times of Flight are directly as the Sines of Elevation. Again, the Times of describing EQ and eq (which are the Halves of the Wholes) being also to one another as S: s, and the Distances EH, eh descended in them, as the Squares of the Times, it likewise follows, that S2: s2:: EH: eh; or that the greatest Altitudes are as the Squares of the Sines of Elevation. Moreover, because (by Trigonometry) PT = r ~ PQ/C and pt = r ~ pq/c ~ and it has been already proved, that, S: s:: PT: pt, it follows, that S: s:: r ~ PQ/C: r ~ pq/c; whence, by multiplying the Antecedents by 2C/r and the Consequents by 2c/r, it will be 2SC/r: 2cs/r (:: 2P Q: 2pq):: P Q: p q. But 2SC/r is known to be the Sine of double the Angle whose Sine is S, and Co-sine C, &c. Therefore the horizontal Amplitudes are to one another, as the Sines of the double Elevations. Corol. 1. Hence it follows, that the greatest Amplitude possible will be, when the Elevation is half a Right Angle, or 45 Degrees (because the Sine of 90~ is the greatest of all others). Corol. [141] Corol. 2. Therefore, if the greatest Amplitude be given (from Experiment) the Amplitude answering to any proposed Elevation, above, or below, 45 Degrees, may from hence be found: For it will be as the Radius, to the Sine of double the given Elevation, so is the greatest, to the required, Amplitude. Corol. 3. Hence, also, the Altitude of the Projection may be known; for QT, when the Angle QPT is half a Right Angle, will be = P Q; and therefore HE (1/4 T Q) = 1/4 P Q; also, in this Case, S2 = 1/2 r2; whence our Proportion S2: s2:: HE: he will here become 1/2 r2: s2:: 1/4 P Q: he; from whence it appears, that, as the Square of the Radius is to the Square of the Sine of any given Elevation, so is half the greatest horizontal Amplitude, to the Altitude of the Projection. Hence it also follows, that the Height to which the Ball would ascend, if projected directly upwards, is just half the greatest Amplitude. Corol. 4. Therefore, since it is well known, that a Body in vacuo ascends and descends with the same Velocity; and that the Distances descended are as the Squares of the Velocities; it follows, that the Amplitudes, at the same Elevation, with different Velocities, will also be to one another as the Squares of the Velocities; because they are as the greatest Amplitudes, with the same Velocities (by Corol. 2.) T 2 and [142] and these are as the Distances perpendicularly descended (by the precedent). Whence, universally, if both the Elevations and the Velocities differ, the Amplitudes will be to each other in a Ratio compounded of the Ratio's of the Sines of double the Angles of Elevation, and of the duplicate Ratio's of the Velocities, or impelling Forces. Problem II. The Angle of Elevation, and the greatest horizontal Amplitude, being given, to find at what Distance the Piece ought to be planted, to hit an Object, whose Distance, above or below the Plane of the Horizon, is also given. Let AB (Fig. 2 and 3.) be the Plane of the Horizon, BC the perpendicular Height or Depression of the Object, and AB the required Distance: Also let BC be produced to meet the Line of Direction AD in D, and let P be the Place where the Path of the Projectile would meet the Horizon; moreover, let P Q be perpendicular to AP, and CN parallel to AD. Then, by the preceding Problem, it will be as Radius: the Sine of 2B AD:: the given (or greatest) Amplitude: AP; which therefore, is known. Moreover, the Areas of similar Triangles being as the Squares of their homologous Sides, we have AP ~ P Q: AB ~ BD:: AQ2: AD2. But AQ2: AD2:: AB ~ BD:: QP: DC (from Principles already explained) therefore, by Equality, AP ~ P Q: AB ~ BD:: QP: DC; and consequently AP: AB:: BD: CD; but (because of the parallel Lines CN and AD) BD: CD:: AB: AN; whence, again [143] again by Equality, AP: AB:: AB: AN; therefore, by Division, AP: BP:: AB: BN; and, consequently AP ~ BN = BP ~ AB. Let AP be now bisected in O; then BP ~ AB being = AO2 OB2 (in the first Case) and = OB2 AO2 (in the second Case), we shall therefore have OB2 = AO2 ~ AP ~ BN = AO ~ AO ~ 2BN: whence the Distance AB is likewise known. Q.E.I. Corollary. Hence, if the Elevation, and the greatest Amplitude, together with the Distance AB of the Object be given, the Height or Depression of the Ball in the Perpendicular BCD will be known: For it is proved, that AP: BP:: BA: BN; whence BN is known: But, as the Radius to the Tangent of BNC (BAD): so is BN to BC. Problem III. The greatest horizontal Amplitudes of the Piece, together with the Distance and Height (or Depression) of the Object being given, to find the Direction or Angle of Elevation. Let B C (Fig. 4 and 5.) be the perpendicular Height or Depression of the Object, AB its given horizontal Distance, and AH the required Direction; Also let P Q (Fig. 6.) be the greatest Amplitude (answering to 45~ of Elevation); draw AC, in which produced (if need be) take AG = P Q; make MGO perpendicular to AG, meeting AB produced (if need be) in O; and from the Centre O, with the Interval O A, let [144] let a Circle be described, intersecting AG, produced in E, and the Line of Direction AD in H; join E, H, and let HI, AN and Q R, be perpendicular to AE, AO, and P Q respectively, and let BC, produced, meet AH in D. It will appear, from what has been said above, that AD2: P R2:: DC: RQ; therefore P R2 being = 2P Q2 = 2 AG2 = 1/2 AE2, and RQ = P Q = 1/2 AE (by Construction), we have AD2: 1/2 AE:: DC: 1/2 AE, and therefore AD2 = AE ~ DC. Now, the Triangles ADC, AEH, being equiangular (because ADC = D AN = AEH, and D AC common to both) we likewise have AD: DC:: AE: EH, and consequently AE ~ DC = AD ~ EH = AD2 (per above); whence EH = AD. Therefore, as the Triangles ADB and EHI are equiangular, they are equal in all respects; and so HI = AB: Whence follows this easy Construction. Having described the Circle AEF, as above directed, and drawn MG perpendicular to AE, take Gn equal to AB, and thro' n, parallel to AE, draw Hh, cutting the Circle in H and h; join A, H, and A, h; then either of the Directions AH or Ah, will answer the Conditions of the Problem. From this Construction we have the following Calculatior, viz. As AB is to BC, so is AG to OG; which added to, or substracted from, Gn (AB) gives On: Then, it will be, as AG: On:: the Co-sine of O AG: Co<inferred>sine</inferred> of HOn (= HAh) the Difference of the two required [145] required Elevations; whence the Elevations themselves are known. Q. E. I. Corol. 1. Hence, if the Elevation of the Piece, with the Distance and the Height (or Depression) of the Object be given, the greatest horizontal Amplitude may be found: For it will be AB: BC:: Radius: Tang. of B AC; whence C AD is also known. Then, S. CAD: S. ACD (AHE):: AD (HE): AE. And, S. ADC: Radius:: AB: AD. Therefore, by compounding these Proportions, we have S. CAD ~ S. ADC: Radius ~ S. ACD:: AB: AE; which is equal to twice the required Amplitude, by Construction. Corol. 2. Moreover, if the Elevation, and the greatest horizontal Amplitude be given, the Amplitude of the Projection on any ascending or descending Plane AE, whose Inclination F AE is also given, may from hence be derived. For, S. AHE (ACD): S: EAH (CAD):: AE (2 P Q): EH (AD) and S. ACD: S. ADC:: AD: AC; whence, by compounding the two Proportions, Sqr. S. ACD: S. CAD ~ S. ADC :: 2 P Q: AC; from which AC is known. Corol. 3. Since it appears, that the Triangles ADB and EHI are equal and alike in all respects, and, therefore, the horizontal Distance AB, universally, equal to the Perpendicular HI, it is manifest, that, when HI [146] HI is the greatest possible, AB will also be the greatest possible; in which Circumstance AC (if the Angle F AE be given) will likewise be the greatest possible: And this, it is evident, must be, when HI coincides with MG, or when the Angles HEA and HAE are equal (as in Fig. 7 and 8); at which time the Point D coincides with H; because AD and EH are always equal to each other. Therefore, since, in this Case, HAE (HE A) is = N AH, it follows, that the Amplitude, on any inclined Plane AE, will be the greatest possible, when the Line of Direction AH bisects the Angle made by the Plane and Zenith. Corol. 4 Hence the greatest Amplitude on any inclined Plane may also be known; for the right-angled Triangles AOG and HOB, having AO = HO and the Angle O common, are equal in all respects; and therefore, as Tang. of AHG (BAH the Angle of Elevation): Tang. of CHG (CAB the Plane's Inclination):: AG: GC; whence AC = AG ~ GC is also known. Corol. 5. Hence, also, if the greatest Amplitude on an inclin'd Plane be given, the greatest horizontal Amplitude may be determined: For, Radius: S. BAC:: AC: BC = CG = the Difference of the given, and the required, Amplitudes. Corol. 6. But if, instead of the Plane's Inclination, the perpendicular Height, or Depression, of the Object be given; then, AC (AG+BC) being to BC, as Radius to [147] to the Sine of BAC, and Radius: Cotang. BAC :: BC: AB; the greatest Distance AB, at which the Ball can possibly hit the Object, will from hence be given: which Distance (because AC = AG~BC, and AB2 = AC + CB ~ AC BC) will also be expressed by ~ AG ~ AG ~ 2 BC. Hence the greatest horizontal Amplitude of a Ball, projected from a given Height above the Plane of the Horizon is known: For ST (Fig. 8.) may here be supposed to represent the <inferred>Plane</inferred> of the Horizon, and SA the given Height; and then SC, being equal to AB, is given from above = ~ AG ~ AG + 2 BC. Corol. 7. But, if the horizontal Distance AB be given, and it be required to find the greatest Height the Ball can possibly reach in the Perpendicular BCD; we shall have HG (AB): AG:: Radius: Tang. of the Elevation (BAH or AHG); and Radius: Tang. BAC (2 BAH ~ 90~):: AB: BC; which therefore is known. But (because AC ~ BC = AG, and AC + CB ~ AC CB = AB2) the same will also be truly exhibited by AG2 ~ AB2/2 AG. Corol. 8. Lastly, let the Height, or Depression, of the Object be given, together with its Distance AB, to determine the Direction, and the least Impetus possible, to hit the Object: Then AB: BC:: Radius: Tang. B AC; whence the Elevation BAH is known: And as Radius: Tang. AHG (BAH):: MG (AB): AG; whence the Impetus is also known. U III.
