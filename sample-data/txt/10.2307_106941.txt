PHILOSOPHI-CAL TRA N SA C:T I ONS ROYAL SOCI-ETY LONDON. FOR THE YEAR MDCCXCV-. PART I1 LONDON, SOLD BY PETER, ELU$LY, PRINTER TO -THE ROYAL SOCIETY. MDCCXCV* ADVERTISEMENT. TrHE Committee appointed by the Royal Society to direct the pub, lication of the Philosophical Transactions, take this opportunity to acquaint the Public, that it fully -appears, as well from the council.books and journals of the Society, as from repeated declarations which have been made in several former 'Transactions, that the printing of them was always, from time totime, the single act of tile respective Secretaries, till the Forty-seventh Volume: the Society, as. a Body, never interesting themselves any further in their publication, than by occasionally recommending the revival of them -to some of their Set cretaries, when, from the particular circumstances of their affairs, the ?lransactions had happened for any length of time to be intermitted. And this seems principally to have been done with a view to satisfy the Public, that their usual meetings were, then continued, for the improvement of knowledge, and benefit of mankind, the great ends of their first institution by the Royal Charters, and whichthey have ever since steadily pursued. But the Society being of late years greatly enlarged, and their com. munications more numerous, it was thought advisable, that a Com. mittee of their members' should be. appointed to reconsider the papers read before them, and select out of them such as they should judge most proper for publication in the future Transactions; which was accordingly done up" n the 26th of March, 1752. And the grounds A 9 of their choice are, and will continue to be, the importance and sins gularity of the subjects, or the advantageous manner of treating them; without pretending to answer for the certainty of the facts, or pro. priety of the reasonings, contained in the several papers so published, which must still rest on the credit or judgment of their respective authors. It isjlikewise necessary on this occasion to remark, that it is an established rule of the Society, to which they will always adhere, never to give their opinion, as aBody, upon any subject, either of Nature or Art, that comes before 'them. And therefore the thanks, which are frequently proposed from the Chair to be given to the authors of such papers as are read at their accustomed meetings, or to the persons through whose hands they receive them, are to be considered in no other light than as a matter of civility, in return for the respect shewn to the So. ciety by those communications. The like also is to be said with regard to the several projects, inventions, and curiosities of various kinds, which are often exhibited to the Society; the authors whereof, or those who exhibit tihem, frequently take the liberty to report, and even to certify in the public news-papers, that they have met with the highest applause and approbation. And therefore it is hloped, that no regard will hereafter be paid to such reports, and puvblic notices; which in some instances have been too lightly credited, to the dishonour of the Society.
