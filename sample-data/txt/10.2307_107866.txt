65j VII Remarks on a correction of the solar tables required by Mr. SOUTH'S observations. By G. B. ARY,> Esq. M. A. Fellow of Trinity College, Cambridge, and Lucasian Professor of Mathematics in the University of Cambridge. Communicated by Dr. YOUNG, F. R. S. &c. Read February 15, 1827. r HE discordances between the sun.s true AR, as observed by Mr. SOUTH, and his calculated AR, as given in the Nautical Almanac, follow a law so simple, as to justify us in attributing them principally to the errors of the solar tables. The only exceptions to this assertion are the differences of March ist, December 22ed, and December 23d, 1822 ; and upon examination of the sun's calculated IR for several days, previous and subsequent to those days, it appears that there is some irregularity in the second differences. I imagine therefore that some small errors have been accumulated in the calcu. lations for those days; but as this is merely conjectural, I have not thought myself at liberty to reject them in the fob. lowing computations. A single inspection of the discrepancies, is sufficient to show that they are almost entirely produced by an error of the epoch, and an error in the place of the perigee. With these errors only I begun my calculations; but finding that the construction of the solar tables (contained in VINCE's Astronomy) gave great facilities for introducing an error in the eccentricity, I begun my calculations again, supposing the epoch, the place of the perigee, and the eccentricity, or the greatest equation MDCCCXXVII. K 66 Mr. AIRY"s remarks on a correction of the of the centre, liable to error. The error of the equation of the centre is found to be so small that it may be neglected: but the errors of the epoch and place of the perigee are considerable. The first part of the operation was to deduce from the errors in MR, the corresponding errors in longitude. This was done by multiplying them by 15 sec. 230 28' cos.t dec. the multiplication by sec. 23? 28' was however reserved to the end, when the results are multiplied by it. The next was, to give the errors which would be occasioned by assumed errors in the epoch, the place of the perigee, and the greatest equation of the centre. As the tables contain the variation of the equation of the centre for a variation of io' in the mean anomaly, and for one of 17",18 in the greatest equation, this was very easily effected. Supposing then that the epoch ought to be increased by x", the mean anomaly by y x lo', and the greatest equation of the centre by z x 1 7",1 8, I get the following equations, each of which is erroneous to the amount of the error of observation. The first side (as was mentioned) ought to be multiplied by sec. 230 28'. 10,57 = x-y x 19,7 zx 0,48 11,87= x y x 19,6 + Z x 2,1 10,38 x-y x 19,4 + Z x 2,91 l,87 x y x 19,1 + z x 4,59 12,8 x-y x 18,9 + z x 4,87 o,31 x y x 16,9 + z x 8,75 894 =x-y x 16,7 + z x 8,99 12,49 x -y x 15,6 + z x 10,43 10,76 x -y x 15,4 + Z x lo,65 8,43=x-y x 14 + z X 12 solar tables required by Mr. SOUTH's observations. 67 al416 x y x :13,4 + Z x 12,54 10,51 x -y x 13,1 + z x 12,74 10,85, X x 12,8 + Z X 12,93 10,85 = X y x 1i2,6 + Z x 13,12 9,81 x X 12,3 + Z X I3,31 9,73-X-Y X 9,9 + Z X 14,79 9990 zX-Y x 9,6 + Z x 14,94 9,76=x-yx 9,3+zx15,08 9,76=x-y x 9 + Z x 15,22 11,99 X y x 6,8 + z x 16,o5 10,19 x-y X 5,8 + Z x 16,34 12,09 =X -y X5,,5 + Z x 16,43 11,6 x-yx 2,8 + z X 1,96 10,52 z -y x 2,5 + Z x 17, 11,93x-yx 0,1 +zx17,8 l0,57 X + y x 6,5 + z x 16,38 9,25X+yx 6,8+zx16g3 7,51 x+yx 9,1+zx15,51 8,6 x +y x 9,4 + Z x 1S,37 7,85 x + y x 11,5 + Z x 14,32 7,4 X + y V 17,9 + Z X 8,59 8)o1=x + yx18, +z x 8,05 5,43 + y x 18,4 + Z x 7,77 7,22X+yx 18,,5 + zx 795 5,78 x + y x 18,9 + Z x 6,98 6,39=9x+yx 19,3 +zx 6,ti 6,2-1 X +yx 1988-zx 4,53 6,54 X+ y X 9,8 -Z x 4,78 8,74 X +y X 12,6z x 13,7 5,52 X + Y X 12 -ZX 14,07 8,45 '' ' tx + Y 11,7 Z X 12494 68 Mr. AIRY'S remarks on a correction of the 3,31 = X 4 + YX 1o,6 -Z x 14,87 0,44 = X + Y x 1os z x 1,5-,O 10,,04 = Zx 9,,7% 14987 9,87 =x -Y XO Zx 14,72 1,39 =X -y x 1,5,1 Z x 10,99 12,19 x Y X 15,3 -Z X 10,77 7,84X-y x 1,5,7-Z x 10,31 12)81..x-yxl6,3--Zx 9,6 12,,544=X-yx17 -ZX 8,62 1o0G65 x-y 17,1-Z x 8,41 1o062z = z y x 17,3 Z x 8j,6 11,22x -y x 17,5-Z x 7)9 9)o2xY x 17,6 -Z x 7,64 1)85 X -y x 17,9-Z x 7,1 9 _x-yx18 -z x 6,86 8,76= x-y x 19,5 zX 2,8 ,19X -*y x 19,7 + Z x o,6 IS99 x-y x 19,6 + z x 1,44 12,51x-y x 196 + Z ). 2,29 1201 X 17,5 + Z x 7,94 9,o8x-y x 17,3 + Z X 8,2 11,03 x y X 17,2 + Z X 845 10, = -y x 17 + Z x 8,7 9,53 = y x 16,8 + Z X 8,95 11,53 = X-y x 16 + z x ,88 11,98 x y x 1X5,8 + Z x 10,15 9,43p X Xy Y 14,1 + z x 11,9 10,57Xx 13,9 + Z Y 12,1 8,03 x -y x 13,6 + Z X 12,31 8,25 = X -y x 13,2 + Z X 12,68 9)S X+ Y 4 +Z 16,9 solar tables required by Mr. SOUTH'S observations. 69 6 X + y x lo,9 + ZX 14,69 5,05 _ x + y x 12,3 + z x i3,86 4,65 X + y x 13,5 + Z x 13,09 5,85 = x + y x 13,7 + z x 12,89. 4 = +y X 16,7 + Z x 10,2 6,o7=x+yx17,3+zx 9,43 6 x96= +yx18,5+zx 7,59 672 =x + y x 18,7 + z x 7,31 5,05 =X +y X 188+ Z x 7,02 2,07-x +y x 2o03 + z x 2,9 2 X+yx2O,4+z.x 2,6 4,7 = X Y X 20,5 + Z X 1,72 3,53 X +y X 20,5 + Z x 1,09 6,23=x +y x 20,5 + 0 X ,47 Grouping together those equations in which the sun's anomaly is included between 1o0 and 48S c, between 48 300 and 78 so3, between 7s so3 and lo" s3, and between l0o s30 and 1' so', as marked by the divisions above, we have the following results.

Subtracting the Winter from the Summer equations, 260,28 = 15 X-y X 91,3 -Z x 41,89. Subtracting the Spring from the Autumn equations, 218,77 21 X x 106 + z x 512,51. By solving these equations we find x -8,23 , y 6,55= z These are to be multiplied by sec. 23 . 28' 1,0902. Performing this multiplication, and forming the quantities XI!, y x lo', andz x 17,"18 we find that the epoch ought to be increased 8'"97, the mean anomaly ought to be diminished 99",8, and the greatest equation of -the centre diminished i1'og. The epoch of the perigee ought therefore to be increased 107",8. The correction of the equation of the centre is so small, that it may be doubtful whether it would be necessary to consider it. In that case, the solar tables would require no other alteration than in the tables of epochs. Every epoch of the sun must be increased by 8",97 or 9", and every epoch of the perigee by 1',48'. If we reject the equation corresponding to the observations of March 1st, December 22d, and December '2d, 1822, (the 43d, 82d, and 83d of the preceding list), we find that the epoch of the sun's longitude must be increased by 9",3, and that of the perigee by i'. 9 and that the greatest er of the centre must be diminished by o",66.
