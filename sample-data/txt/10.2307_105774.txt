[174] XXVI. A Specimen of a new Method of comparing Curvilineal Areas; by which many such Areas may be compared as have not yet appeared to be comparable by any other Method. By John Landen, F. R. S. W H E N a body in motion is continually acted upon by a variable force, the space it has passed over at the end of any given time, it is well known, will be expressed by the area of the curve, whose ordinate expresses the velocity of the body, whilst the time it has been in motion is expressed by the corresponding abscissa. Therefore the facilitating the computation of curvilineal areas will manifestly contribute to the improvement of the doctrine of motion. Which doctrine being a branch of philosophy of no small importance, such improvement will not, I am persuaded, be looked upon as a trifling speculation, by the Royal Society: to whom, therefore, I do myself the honour of communicating this specimen of a new and ready method of computing such arcas, by means of a given area; presuming that what is here written will not be deemed undeserving of a place in the Philosophical Transactions. Read June 9, 1768. I. Geometricians have found, that, if A be put to denote the whole area of the curve, whose abscissa is x, and ordinate 1 x2~p-1 X x2r-1, the [175] the whole area of the curve, whose abscissa is x, and ordinate 1-x2~p-1 X x2n+2r-1 will be = r.r + 1.r + 2 (n)/p+r.p+r+1.p+r+2 (n) X A; n being any positive integer, and p and r any positive numbers, whole or fractional. II. By the preceding article, the whole area, when the ordinate is 1 + x~p-1 X x2r+2z-1 is = z.z + 1 (r)/p+z.p+z+1 (r) X 1.2(z-1)/p.p + 1 (z) X 1/2; the whole area, when the ordinate is 1 x~p-1 X x2z-1, being = 1.2(z-1)/p.p + 1 (z) X 1/2. Likewise, by the same article, the same whole area is = r.r+1.r+2 (z)/p+r.p+r+1.p+r+2 (z) X A. Therefore this last expression is = z.z+1 (r)/p+z.p+z+1 (r) X 1.2 (z 1)/p.p + 1 (z) X 1/2. From which equation, p and r being positive, as before observed, A, the whole area of the curve, whose ordinate is 1 x2~p 1 X x 2r 1, is found equal to 1.2.3 (r+z-1) X p+r.p+r+1 (z)/p.p+1.p+2 (r+z) X r.r+1 (z) X 1/2, being any number whatever. Consequently, supposing z infinite, we find A = the ultimate value, or limit of 1.2.3 (z) X p+r.p+r+1 (z)/p.p+1.p+2 (z) Xr.r+1 (z) X 1/2z. Having thus obtained a general expression ~ for the whole area of any curve, whose ordinate is expressed by 1 x2~p-1 X x2r-1, and that expression [176] expression for such area consisting of an infinite number of factors multiplied together; to render the same useful in practice, some theorems are requisite for ascertaining the limits of such products. The theorems which I have hitherto been able to investigate suitable tohat purpo se, I shall give in the next two articles. III. The limit of 1-m2 X 22-m2 X 32-m2 (z) X N2z/z2z + 1 is = 2/m X sine of mS; N being the number whose hyp. log. is 1, and S the semiperiphery of the circle, whose radius is 1. Whence, by taking m equal o, we find the limit of 12. 22. 32 (z) X N2z/z2z+1 = 2S, IV. The limit of dz + a X dz + a + d X dz + a + 2d X Nz/22z dz zz is=2~/d-1/2. Hence, z+1. z+2. z+3 (z) being = 1. 3,5 (z) X 2z, it appears, that the limit of 1.3.5 (z) X Nz/2z zz is=2 1/2. I shall now give some examples, to shew the use of the above articles. Writing [177] V. Writing A, B, C, D, and E, for the whole areas of the curves, whose ordinates are x2/3/1 x2~1/2, x1/3/1 x2~1/2, 1/1 x2~1/2, x ~/1 x2~1/2, and x 2/3/1 x2~1/2, respectively; we have, by Art. II. A = the limit of 1. 2. 3 (z) ~ 4. 7. 10 (z)/1. 3. 5 (z) ~ 5. 11. 17 (z) ~ 2 2z 1/z; B = the limit of 1. 2. 3 (z) ~ 7. 13. 19 (z)/1. 3. 5 (z) ~ 2. 5. 8 (z) ~ 1/2z; C = the limit of 12. 22. 32 (z)/12. 32. 52 (z) ~ 2 2z 1/z = the area of the semi-circle, whose radius is 1; D = the limit of 1. 2. 3 (z) ~ 5. 11. 17 (z)/1. 3. 5 (z) ~ 1. 4. 7 (z) ~ 1/2z; E = the limit of 1. 2. 3 (z) ~ 2. 5. 8 (z)/1. 3. 5 (z) ~ 1. 7. 13 (z) ~ 2 2z 1/z. Now it appears by the above equations, that A/B is = the limit of 2. 4. 5. 7. 8. 10 (2z)/5. 7. 11. 13. 17. 19 (2z) ~ 2 2z; which by Art. III. is = 6 ~ sine 60~/12 ~ sine 30~=31/2/2. Therefore A is = 3 1/2 B/2. V O L. LVIII. A a It [178] It appears also, that B ~ D/C is = the limit of 5. 7. 11. 13. 17. 19 (2z)/2. 4. 5. 7. 8. 10 (2z) ~ 3/2 2z + 1; which by Art. III. is = 3 1/2. Therefore D is = 3 1/2C/B. It likewise appears, that B ~ E is = the limit of 12. 22. 32 (z)/12. 32. 52 (z) ~ 3. 2 2z 1/z = 3 C. Therefore E = 3 C/B. VI. Writing F, G, H, I, and K, for the whole areas of the curves, whose ordinates are x 2/3/1 x~ 1/3, x1/3/1 x2~ 1/3, 1/1 x2~1/3, x 1/3/1 x2~1/3, and x 2/3/1 x2~1/3, respectively, we have, by Art. II. F = the limit of 1. 2. 3 (z) ~ 9. 15. 21 (z)/2. 5. 8 (z) ~ 5. 11. 17 (z) ~ 3z/2z; G = the limit of 1. 2. 3 (z) ~ 8. 14. 20 (z)/22. 52. 82 (z) ~ 3z/2 z+1 ~z; H = the limit of 1. 2. 3 (z) ~ 7. 13. 19 (z)/2. 5. 8 (z) ~ 1. 3. 5 (z) ~ 1/2z = B; I = the [179] I = the limit of 12. 22. 32 (z)/ 2. 5. 8 (z) ~ 1. 4. 7 (z) ~ 32z/2z; K = the limit of 1. 2. 3 (z) ~ 5. 11. 17 (z)/2. 5. 8 (z) ~ 1. 7. 13 (z) ~ 3z/2z. By which equations it appears, that F/H = F/B is = the limit of 1. 3. 3. 5. 5. 7 (2z)/5. 7. 11. 13. 17. 19 (2z) ~ 32z; which by Art. III. is = 4 ~ sine of 90~/12 ~ sine of 30~ = 2/3. Therefore F is = 2 B/3. It appears likewise, that G/B is = the limit of 1. 3. 5 (z) ~ 8. 14. 20 (z)/2. 5. 8 (z) ~ 7. 13. 19 (z) ~ 3z/2z = the limit of 1. 3. 5 (z) ~ 4. 7. 10 (z)/4. 7. 10 (2z) ~ 6z = the limit of 1. 3. 5 (z)/3z + 4. 3z + 7. 3z + 10 (z) ~ 6z; which, by Art. IV. is = 2 -1/3. Therefore G is = ~. It also appears, that I is = the limit of 12. 22. 32 (z)/2. 3. 5. 7. 8. 10 (2z) ~ 32z + 1/2; which, by Art. III. = 2S/4 ~ sine of 60~ = S/3 1/2 = 2 C/3 1/2. A a 2 Moreover [180] Moreover it appears, that B ~ K/~ is = the limit of 1.4.7 (z) ~ 5.11.17 (z)/2.5.8 (z) ~ 1.3.5 (z) ~ 1/3z 1 = the limit of 3z + 2.3z + 5.3z + 8 (z)/1.3.5 (z) ~ 1/2z.3z 1; which, by Art. IV. is = 3/2 1/3. Therefore K is = 3 J/2 1/3 B = 22/3.31/2 C/B. And, in like manner, may a great number of other areas be compared. Note. All the whole areas above-mentioned are supposed to begin where x begins, and to stand upon a base = 1. Received
