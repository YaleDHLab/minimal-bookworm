(976) (977) there may be place for so much the greater number of these particles to strike it at the same time, and so to render their impression more strong. And that these odorant particles, which run with the Air into the Nose, in smelling, might not all forthwith pass off from thence into the breast: Nature by this Labyrinth, made by the windings of the Lamellae, hath taken care to give them an arrest and longer stay. And for the same reason, she hath furnished the said Tunick of the Nose with a great many small Glands, which open thereinto; and so moisten it with a thick and slimy exudation, the better to entangle the dry odorant particles. This Tunick examined and compar'd in several Animals, shews also much of the reason of the delicacy of Smelling in some, above what it is in others. For look how much a finer Nose it is that Animals have, they have likewise so much a greater number of these Lamellae, wherewith the said Tunick is roll'd up in so many more folds. So the Nose of a Hound is better furnished with them, than that of any other Animals. The Hare, Fox, Cat, Wild Boar, have a considerable number of them. Those Animals that chew the Cud, have fewer. And Man is less provided for, than any of the rest. Thus far the Learned Observer. And Note, That not only the number, but also the length of the Lamellae, is of great use for the strength of Smelling. For which purpose most Quadrupeds, which either hunt, as the Carnivorous; or at least want reason otherwise to distinguish their food, than by the smell,as the Graminivorous; have their Nose not placed in the middle of the face, as in Man; but prolonged to the very end.
