[112] XII. Catalogue of Double Stars. By Mr. Herschel, F. R. S. communicated by Dr. Watson, Jun. Read January 10, 1782. I N T R O D U C T O R Y R E M A R K S. THE following catalogue contains not only double-stars, but also those that are treble, double-double, quadruple, double-treble, and multiple. The particulars I have given of them are comprehended under the following general heads. I. The names of the stars and number in FLAMSTEAD'S Catalogue; or, if not contained therein, such a description of their situation as will be found sufficient to point them out. II. The comparative size of the stars. On this occasion I have used the terms equal, a little unequal, pretty unequal, considerably unequal, very unequal, extremely unequal, and excessively unequal, as expressing the different gradations to which I have endeavoured to affix always the same meaning. III. The colours of the stars as they appeared to me when I viewed them. Here I must remark, that different eyes may perhaps differ a little in their estimations. I have, for instance, found, that the little star which is near ~ Herculis, by some to whom I have shewn it has been called green, and by others blue. Nor will this appear extraordinary when we recollect that there are blues and greens which are very often, particularly by candlelight, mistaken for each other. The situation will also affect the Mr. HERSCHEL'S Catalogue of Double Stars. 113 the colour a little, making a white star appear pale red when the altitude is not sufficient to clear it of the vapours. It is difficult to find a criterion of the colours of stars, though I might in general observe that Aldebaran appears red, Lyra white, and so on; but when I call the stars garnet, red, pale red, pale rose-colour, white inclining to red, white, white inclining to blue, blueish white, blue, greenish, green, dusky, I wish rather to refer to the double stars themselves to explain what is meant by those terms. IV. The distances of the stars are given several different ways. Those that are estimated by the diameter can hardly be liable to an error of so much as one quarter of a second; but here must be remembered what I have before remarked on the comparative appearance of the diameters of stars in different instruments. Those that are measured by the micrometer, I fear, may be liable to an error of almost a whole second; and if not measured with the utmost care, to near 2~. This is, however, to be understood only of single measures; for the distance of many of them that have been measured very often in the course of two years observations can hardly differ so much as half a second from truth, when a proper mean of all the measures is taken. As I always make the wires of my micrometer outward tangents to the apparent diameter of the stars, all the measures must be understood to include both their diameters; so that we are to deduct the two semi-diameters of the stars if we would have the distance of their centers. What I have said concerns only the wire micrometers, for my last new micrometer is of a such a construction, that it immediately gives the distance of the centers and its measures (as far as in a few months Ihave been able to find out) may be relied on to about one-tenth of a second, when a mean of three observations is taken. When I have V O L. LXXII. Q added 114 Mr. HERSCHEL'S Catalogue added inaccurate, we may suspect an error of 3 or 4~. Exactly estimated may be taken to be true to about one-eighth part of the whole distance; but only estimated, or about, &c. is in some respect quite undetermined; for it is hardly to be conceived how little we are able to judge of distances when, by constantly changing the powers of the instrument, we are as it were left without any guide at all. I should not forget to add, that the measure of stars, whereof one is extremely small, must claim a greater indulgence than the rest on account of the difficulty of seeing the wires when the field of view cannot be sufficiently enlightened. V. The angle of position of the stars I have only given with regard to the parallel of declination, to be reduced to that with the ecliptic as occasion may require. The measures always suppose the large star to be the standard, and the situation of the small one is described accordingly. Thus in figure 12. AB represents the apparent diurnal motion of a star in the direction of the parallel of declination AB; and the small star is said to be south preceding at mn, north preceding at op, south following at qr, and north following at st. The measure of these angles, I believe, may be relied upon to 2~ or at most 3~, except when mentioned inaccurate, where an error amounting to 5~ may possibly take place. In mere estimations of the angle, without any wires at all, an error may amount to at least 10~, when the stars are near each other. VI. The dates when I first perceived the stars to be double, treble, &c. are marked in the margin of each star. To shorten the work as much as possible, I have put L. for the large star; S. for the small star; w. for white; r. for red; d. for dusky; n. for north; s. for south; and have likewise occaof Double Stars. 115 occasionally used other abbreviations that will be easily understood. It may be seen, that this catalogue is yet in a very imperfect state, many of the stars not having even the principal elements of distance and position determined with any degree of accuracy; but having already mentioned the reason why I give it imperfect as it is, I can only add that my endeavours will not be wanting soon to remove those defects. However, since this can only be a work of some time, we may hope, in the mean while, that many lovers of the science will turn their thoughts upon the same subject.

Position of the two nearest 11~ 32~ s. following. For an account of the single star, see the second class. As perfect as I have seen this treble star with 460, it is one of the most beautiful sights in the heavens; but requires a very fine evening. 11. In constellatione Cancri, FL. 11. Double.

Aug. 17. 1781. of Double Stars. 119 w. With 227 they seem almost to touch, or at most 1/4 diameter of S. asunder; with 460, 1/2 or 3/4 diameter of S. This is a fine object to try a telescope, and a miniature of ~ Geminorum. Position 29~ 54~ n. following. 16. ~ Coronae borealis, FL. 2. Double. A little unequal. They are whitish stars. They seem in contact with 227, and though I can see them with this power, I should certainly not have discovered them with it; with 460, less than 1/4 diameter; with 932, fairly separated, and the interval a little larger than with 460. I saw them also with 2010, but they are so close that this power is too much for them, at least when the altitude of the stars is not very considerable; with 460 they are as fine a miniature of i Bootis as that is of ~ Geminorum. Position 59~ 19~ n. following. Sept. 9. 1781. 17. In constellatione Bootis, near FL. 51. Double. It is a star near ~ not marked in FLAMSTEAD'S Catalogue. Considerably unequal. Both dusky w. inclined to r. The interval with 460 is 3/4 diameter of S. The position of the small star is turned towards ~ a little following the line which joins L to ~ Bootis. See ~ Bootis in the sixth class. Sept. 10. 1781. 18. In constellatione Coronae borealis. Double. It is the smallest of two telescopic stars between ~ and ~, not contained in FL. Cat. Equal. Both d. With 460, about 13/4 diameters. Position 21~ 0~ n. following. Sept. 10. 1781. 19. 120 Mr. HERSCHEL'S Catalogue 19. h Draconis, near FL. 19. One of the most minute of all the double stars I have hitherto found. It is the small telescopic star near the preceding h Draconis. Considerably unequal. Both dusky w. inclining to r. With 460, they seem in contact; I have however had a very good view of a small dark division between them. Position (by exact estimation) 25 or 30~ s. preceding. They are too minute for any micrometer I have. It is in vain to look for them if every circumstance is not favourable. The observer as well as the instrument must have been long enough out in the open air to acquire the same temperature. In very cold weather, an hour at least will be required; but in a moderate temperature, half an hour will be sufficient. Sept. 10. 1781. 20. In dextro humero Orionis, FL. 52. Double. A little unequal. Both w. a little inclining to pale r. With 227, 1/4 diameter; with 460, 1/2 diameter. Position 69~ 41~ s. preceding. Oct. 1. 1781. 21. c Trianguli, near FL. 12. and 13. Double. It is the most north of a small telescopic trapezium of unequal stars. Extremely unequal. With 460, 3/4 diameter of L. Position (by estimation) 55 or 60~ n. preceding. Oct. 8. 1781. 22. n Orionis, FL. 33. Duarum praecedentium 13am (~) antecedens. Double. Considerably unequal. L. w.; S. w.; inclining to blue. With 227, they seem almost in contact; with 460, 1/2 diameter of S. Position 60~ 55~ n. following. A very pleasing object and easily seen. Oct. 22. 1781. 4 23. In of Double Stars. 121 23. In posterioribus femoribus Canis minoris. A most minute double star. It is the small telescopic star following Procyon. A little unequal. Both w. With 278, 1/8 of a diameter of S.; with 460, near 1/4 of a diameter of S. They are closer than ~ Coronae, because their diameters, by which they are estimated, are smaller. Position 27~ 21~ s. following. To see this very minute double star well, Procyon should be near its meridian altitude. There is a small telescopic star preceding the double star. Distance 1~ 59~ 39~ from center to center. Nov. 21, 1781. 24. ~ Cancri, FL. 16. A most minute treble star. It will at first sight appear as only a double star, but with proper attention, and under favourable circumstances, the preceding of them will be found to consist of two stars, which are considerably unequal. The largest of these is larger than the single star; and the least of the two is less than the single star. The first and second (in the order of magnitude) pretty unequal. The second and third pretty unequal. The two nearest both pale r. or r. With 278, but just separated; with 460, 1/4 diameter of S. Position 86~ 32~ n. following. For measures relating to the third or single star see ~ Cancri in the third class of double stars. Nov. 21, 1781. V O L. LXXII.

Distance by the micrometer 5~, 156. Position 32~ 47~ n. preceding. These are all a mean of the last two years observations, except the first with 146. April 8, 1778. 2. ~ ~ Herculis, FL. 64.

With 227, 12/3 diameter of L.; with 460, much above 2 diameters of L. Position 9~ 14~ s. following. Mean of two years observations. Aug. 29. 1779. 5. et 6. * ~ Lyra, FL. 4. and 5. A very curious double-double star. At first sight it appears double at some considerable distance, and by attending a little we see that each of the stars is a very delicate double star. The first set consists of stars that are considerably unequal. The stars of the second set are equal, or the preceding of them rather larger than the following. The colour of the stars in the first set L. very w.; S. a little inclining to r. In the second set both w. The interval between the stars of the unequal set, with a power of 227, is full 1 diameter of L.; with 460, near 11/2 diameter of L.; with 932, full 11/2 diameter; with 2010, 21/3 diameters. The interval between the equal set with a power of 227 is almost 11/2 diameter of either; with 460, full 13/4 diameter; with 932, 2 diameters; with 2010, 21/2 diameters. These estimations are a mean of two years observations. Position of the unequal set 56~ 0~ n. following. Position of the equal set 72~ 57~ s. following. Aug. 29. 1779. 7. * ~ Aquarii, FL. 55. Trium in manu dextra praecedens. Double. Equal, or the preceding rather the largest. Both w. With 227, 11/4 diameter; with 449, 11/3 diameter; with 460, 2 diameters; with 910, near 2 diameters; with 932, 21/2 diameters; R 2 with Sept. 12. 1779. 124 Mr. HERSCHEL'S Catalogue with 2010, pretty distinct; but too tremulous to estimate. With my 20 feet reflector, power 600, full 2 diameters, very distinct. Position, 71~ 39~ n. following. Distance 4~,56, mean of two years observation. 8. ~ Coronae borealis, FL. 7. Double. Considerably unequal. L. fine w. S. w. inclining to r. With 222, almost 3 diameters of L. Distance 5~,468. Position 25~ 51~ n. preceding, mean of two years observations. Oct. 1. 1779. 9. ~ Orionis, FL. 39. In capite nebulosa. Quadruple, or rather a double star and two more at a small distance. The double star considerably unequal. L. w.; S. pale rose colour. With 222, 11/2 diameter of L.; with 449, above two diameters of L. Distance 5~,833, a mean of all the measures. Position 45~ 14~ n. following. As every one of the four stars is perfectly distinct, it is evident, the whole appeared nebulous to FLAMSTEAD for no other reason than because his telescope had not sufficient power to distinguish them. Oct. 7. 1779. 10. and 11. ~ Orionis, FL. 48. Ultimam cinguli praecedit ad austrum. A double-treble star, or two sets of treble stars, almost similarly situated. Preceding set.

The difference in the distance of the two stars is so considerable, that we can hardly account for it otherwise than by admitting a proper motion in either one or the other of the stars, or in our solar system; most probably neither of the three is at rest. 12. * ~ Arietis, FL. 9.

Having often measured the diameters of many of the principal fixed stars, and having always found that they measured less and less the more I magnified, I fixed upon this fine star for taking a ~ with the highest power I have yet been able to apply, and upon the largest scale of my new micrometer I could conveniently use. With a power of 6450 (determined by experiments upon a known object at a known distance) I looked at this star for at least a quarter of an hour, that the eye might adapt itself to the object; having experimentally found, that the aberration by this means will appear less and less, and, in the telescope I used upon this occasion with powers from 460 to 1500, will often quite vanish, and Oct.22, 1781. ~ In a future collection the small star at the obtuse angular point will be found ~ a double star of the second or third class. U 2 leave 148 Mr. HERSCHEL'S Catalogue leave a very well-defined circular disk for the apparent diameter of the stars. The diameter of ~ Lyrae, by this attention, appeared perfectly round, and occasionally separated from rays that were flashing about it. From the very brilliant appearance of the star with this great power, and a pretty accurate rough calculation founded on its apparent brightness, when observed with the naked eye with 227, with 460, with 6450, I surmise, that it has light enough to bear being magnified at least a hundred thousand times with no more than six inches of aperture, provided we could have such a power, and other considerations would allow us to apply it. When I had as good a view as I expected to have, I took its diameter with my new micrometer upon a scale of eight inches and 4428 ten thousandth to 1~ of a degree, and found it subtended an angle of 0~,3553. I had no person at the clock; but suppose the time of its passing through the field of my telescope (which in this great power is purposely left undefined, and as large as possible) was less than three seconds. 40. ~ Lyrae, FL. 8.

SINCE my having delivered my paper on the Parallax of the Fixed Stars, in which I refer to the above Catalogue of Double Stars, I have received, by the favour of our President Sir JOSEPH BANKS, the fourth volume of the Acta Academiae Theodoro Palatinae, which contains a most excellent Memoir of Mr. MAYER'S, `` De novis in Coelo sidereo Phaenomenis;'' wherein I see that the idea of ascertaining the proper motion of the stars by means of small stars that are situated at no great distance from large ones, has induced that gentleman before me to look out for such small stars. In the course of that undertaking he has discovered a good many double stars, of which he has given us a pretty large list, some of them the same with those in my catalogue. My view being the annual parallax required stars much nearer than those that would do for Mr. MAYER'S 158 Mr. HERSCHEL'S Catalogue MAYER'S purpose; therefore I examined the heavens with much higher powers, and looked out chiefly for such as were exceedingly close. The above catalogue contains 269 double stars, 227 of which, to my present knowledge, have not been noticed by any person. I hope they will prove no inconsiderable addition to the general stock, especially as in that number there are a great many which are out of the reach of Mr. MAYER'S and other mural quadrant or transit instruments. It can hardly be expected, that a power of 70 or 80 would be sufficient to discover those curious stars that are contained in the first class of my catalogue; so that it is not strange they should have intirely escaped Mr. MAYER'S notice. We see that it is not for want of his looking at those stars; for we find he has frequently observed ~ Cancri, the star near Procyon, and the star in Monoceros, without perceiving the small stars near them, which I have pointed out. Nor is it only in the first class that his telescope wanted power, light, and distinctness; for the small stars that are near ~ Orionis, ~ Serpentis, ~ Orionis, e Pegasi, ~ Lyrae, ~ Andromedae, ~ Sagittarii, ~ Aquilae, ~ Pegasi, ~ Lyrae, ~ Librae, ~ Piscium, ~ Tauri, and many more, have escaped his discovery, though he has given us the places of other more distant small stars not far from them, and therefore must have had them frequently in the field of view of his telescope. In settling the relative situations of very close double stars, neither Mr. MAYER'S instruments, nor his method, were adequate to the purpose. It is well known, that whenever we employ time as a measure, the results cannot be very accurate; because a mistake of no more than a tenth part of a second in time will produce an error of a whole second and an half in measure, so that his AR must be of Double Stars. 159 be extremely defective. Nor could his micrometer give the declination much better unless the telescope had bore a power of at least 4 or 500. When the angle of position is but small, such as 3, 4, 5, or 6 degrees, and the distance of the stars not above a few seconds, it is evident, that a micrometer must be able to measure tenths of a second at least to give even a tolerable exactness of position. On the contrary, the position being measured with such a micrometer as I have constructed for the purpose, we may from thence deduce the declination, with great confidence, true to a quarter of a tenth of a second for every second of the distance of the stars. Mr. M A Y E R's account of ~ Geminorum, for instance, gives a difference of 0~,7 of time in AR, of 3~,8 in declination, and of 1 to 6 in magnitude or degree of light of the stars. These quantities reduced to my notation, and compared with my measures of the same star, give Mr. M A Y E R's Mine Distance9~,635 from center to center 5~,156 diameters included. Position 23~ 14~ n. preceding 32~ 47~ n. preceding. Magnitude extremely unequal A little unequal. To account for this difference I ascribe Mr. M A Y E R's error in distance to his method of measuring by time. The error of position follows always from an observation of the declination taken with the common micrometer, when it is deduced from an erroneous AR. In my measures the distance and position are independent of each other, which I look upon as no small advantage of my cross-hair micrometer. The error in the magnitudes of the stars I ascribe to the want of power in Mr. M A Y E R's telescope, which did not separate the stars far enough for him to judge accurately of their size, otherwise he would soon have found, that instead of five there is hardly so much as one 160 Mr. HERSCHEL'S Catalogue one single degree of difference in their magnitudes. See fig. 6. for a representation of those stars with my power of 460. I do not mean to depreciate Mr. M A Y E R's method, the excellence of which is well known; and with some stars of my third, all those of the fourth, fifth, and sixth classes, as well as with those still farther distant, to which he has applied it with admirable skill, and `` magno labore, multisque `` nocturnis vigillis'' (as he very justly expresses himself) a better can hardly be wished for; but with stars of the second class which generally differ no more than one, two or threetenths of a second of time in AR, and can never differ more than four tenths, the insufficiency of measuring by time is obvious. In regard to the declination, it is also no less evident, that it is much more accurate to take an angle, which may be had true to 2 or 3~ at most, than to measure its tangent, which in stars of the second class is generally no more than 2, 3, or 4~ of a degree, and can never exceed five. I do not so much as mention the stars of the first class: they must certainly, as to sense, pass the meridian at the same instant of time. Their distance has even eluded the attacks of my smallest silk-thread micrometer armed with an excellent power of 460; but I shall soon apply my last new instrument to them *, not without hopes of success. Now, though I have hitherto not been able to express the distance of the stars of the first class, otherwise than by the proportion it bears to their apparent diameters, I think it a very great point gained, that one of my instruments at least (viz. the cross-hair micrometer) has laid hold of them: for their angle of position, I think, is within a very small quantity as well determined as it is in those of the second class. This simple but most useful instrument can, by actual measure, * For a description of which see p. 163. discover of Double Stars. 161 discover beyond a doubt a motion in two stars that are very close together, though it should amount to no more than a tenth part of a second of a degree, provided that motion be in such a direction that the effect of it be thrown upon the angle of position; wherein, with some of the stars of the first class, it would occasion an alteration of 10, 20, 30, or more degrees. I have marked all those stars in my catalogue which have been observed by Mr. M A Y E R and other astronomers with an asterisk (*) affixed to the number that they may be known; those with the mark of a dagger (~) have been observed by different astronomers before Mr. M A Y E R. Among the stars which are not marked, will be found several that have been observed by Mr. M A Y E R; but, on comparing them together, it will be seen, that they are observations of different small stars; for instance, Mr. M A Y E R (Act. Acad. vol. IV. p. 296.) observed a small star near Rigel at the distance of 1~ 0~,5 AR in time, and 2~ 55~,2 in difference of declination north preceding Rigel. In my second class (the 34th star) we also find Rigel; but the small star I have observed is one which has not been seen by Mr. M A Y E R, and is at a distance of no more than 6~ 27~. Position 68~ 12~ south preceding; and so on with other stars. I have used the expression double-star in a few instances of the sixth class in rather an extended signification: the example of F L A M S T E A D, however, will sufficiently authorize my application of the term. I preferred that expression to any other, such as Comes, companion, or Satellite; because, in my opinion, it is much too soon to form any theories of small stars revolving round large ones, and therefore I thought it adviseable carefully to avoid any expression that might convey that idea. I am V O L. LXXII. Y very 162.Mr. HERSCHEL'S Catalogue of Double Stars very well persuaded, FLAMSTEAD, who first used the word Comes, meant it only in a figurative sense. I shall not fail to take the first opportunity of looking out for those of Mr. MAYER's double-stars which I have not in my catalogue, amounting to 31; and also for one I find mentioned in La Connoissance des Temps for 1783, discovered by Mr. MESSIER.
