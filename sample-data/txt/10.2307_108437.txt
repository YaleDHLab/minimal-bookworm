[ 261 3 XIII. Gen era l Me thods in Analysis for the resolution of Linear Equations in Finite Djfferences and Linear Djzffrential Equations. By CHARLES JAMES HARGREAVE, Esy., L.L.B., F.R.S., Professor of Jurisprudence in University College, London. Received March 15,-Read March 29, 1849. Preliminary Remarks. 1. THE investigations presented in this paper consist of two parts; the first offers a solution, in a certain qualified sense, of the general linear equation in finite differences; and the second will be found to give an almost complete analysis of the resolution in series of the general linear differential equation with rational factors. The second part is deduced directly from the results of the first, although the subjects of which they respectively treat appear to be wholly independent of each other. With the exception of a few cases capable of solution by partial and artificial methods, there does not at present exist any mode of solving linear equations in finite differences of an order higher than the first; and with reference to such equations of the first order, we are obliged to be content with those insufficient forms of functions which are intelligible only when the independent variable is an integer, and which may be obtained directly from the equation itself by merely giving to the independent variable its successive integer values. It is in this insufficient and qualified sense that the solutions here given are to be taken; and the first part of the following investigations may be considered as an extension of this form of solution from the general equation of the first order to the general equation of the nth order.

The investigation the results of which are given in this part, although it actually succeeds in solving the original equation, will be found to contribute little or nothing to the analytical theory as above explained; and this arises from the circumstance, that the particular solution, instead of being produced in the separated form above written, is produced in an aggregated form, G,+AG,-,+BG,_2+*** and the complementary part of the general solution, instead of being produced as above, appears in the form of a sum of the complementary functions above written, the constants c', c", &c. being the same in all. But as we shall thus obtain a solution with an arbitrary constant, capable of solving the original equation deprived of G., we have it in our power to solve the equation completely by reducing the order of the equation in successive steps. If we take the equation of the first order, = P~u, 1 -+ Gx, and arrive at its solution, not properly by any analytical method, but by giving to x the successive values x, X-1, x-2.....m+1, m, m-1l and eliminating all values of uZ between the first and the last, we have UX-,!PXUX-l+Gx =P,(P, 1U, 2+G,1)+G, or PP_,u_2+PG_}+G, P.P.1 (Px2UX,3+ G_2) + PZG-1 +G. or P P lP_2u_ +PZPlG_2+PtGl + G, = (Pt!Px. . . .Pm)um-i+ (Px..

By applying the same process of successive elimination to the general linear equation (1.), and carefully observing the law by which the entrance of the factors PX, Q., Rx, &c. is governed, it will be found that an exactly similar solution may be found in the form JP ..PM (I (p G~1) +c~j Ux g-m (PM,,.P))} or U8v-Gv+Pr(;x1+e(PxPt-,).Gx-2+Sv(Px* ...

Vn_ not of a strictly algebraical character, which are capable of being performed only upon factorial expressions containing consecutive values of Pt, and which have the following significations. VI denotes one operation of this character, signifying that the factor P_1 Pm is changed into Q. as often as it occurs, any term in which it does not occur disappearing, and the sum of the terms thus obtained being the result of the operation; so that, for example, Vl(P~lP~)-= Q, Vl(PIP) = 0, V, (PX2PXIP~) = QXPX+ P_2Q,,, V1(P_2PLPX) =0, VI(Px-3Px2PI1Px) = Qx2PXIPx+PX,3QxPX+PX+Px.2Q, V1(PX-3PX-2PX1P-) )=2Qx2Q. &c. &c. Again, V2 denotes another operation of a similar character, signifying that the factor Pml2PMnPrn is changed into Rm as often as it occurs, the result of the operation being as before the sum of the terms; so that, for example, we have v 2\tx-2P x-1Px)=Rxq V2 (Px-3PX-2PxP ) = RxPx + Px-AX V-2(Px_4Px-3Px-2Px_1PX)= Rx-2Px-lPx+ Px-4Rx-lPx+Px4Px-3Rx, V2(Px-5 ...

HARGREAVE ON THE RESOLUTION OF LINEAR EQUATIONS IN It might at first sight be supposed that this process, if successful at all, would give the complete complementary solution in the form Ux= CiSV(PI . . Px) + C2(P2. * Px) +* but it will be found that in reality this introduces only one arbitrary constant. It now remains to place these expressions under a properly algebraic form, and to verify the result; and in order to do this we must express the general term ev(P....P,+1) in terms of the factors of the original equation; and afterwards give to p, which in the first instance is regarded as a constant, the successive values required for forming the several terms of the solution. This may be done as follows:QX Rr 8X VvX ZX _t __ = __ ___ _W_ _and _._, et =1qX px-2px-1pxr x-3x-2 x-1 -n+2 P* * *-n+l * * = aX Then it is easily seen that VI (PX ...

Thus V1 (PX.* Px_3) = (PX * * Px_3) (qx + qxI + qx-2), 2 P. 3) = PX..* PX-3(.Xqx-2) V1 (Px... *= (P*.* PX4) (qx+ qx-, +qX-2 + qx-3) 2 PX-4) = ... *PX-4(q(qx2+ qX-3) + qx-Iq3) Vl(Px -Pxs) = (P) w *Px-a) (qv+qx l +qx 2+qx-3+qx-4)1 21 2 VI(PX.

P It may be here observed that the number of the terms of the series N P+N/ p+.. cannot exceed 2(x-p)+ 1 when xc-p is even, and 2(x-p+ 1) when x-p is odd; and since p has the successive values x-2, x-3, &c., it is always known whether x-p be odd or even. The number of terms may be less; for if QX be zero, the number of terms would be the next whole number above W(X-p), &c. That the equation u =c(PX...

HARGREAVE ON THE RESOLUTION OF LINEAR EQUATIONS IN In this part of the solution, I apprehend that it will not generally be necessary to have regard to the lower limits, since p may have any constant value, and that value may be taken which is most convenient in each case; and if we make p -oc, all the lower limits will have this value. This part of the solution would then be U,-1 CPv .... Piii1+Av+BVg+CVt+..Il where and generally each term of the part within the brackets is formed from the preceding term thus: first change x into x1, multiply by q,,+,, and effect a summation; then change (in such preceding term) a, into x-2, multiply by ra+,, and effect a sumnmation; and so on until lastly we change x into x-n+I, multiply by zl, and effect a summation; and the sum of the parts thus obtained is the next term. The verification of the particular solution is easily derived from the above; but it rests on the assumption that the algebraic value above given for s'(P. P,+,) is correct; to which therefore particular attention is directed. The equation Zr= ce(P. . Pp + l), considered as a solution of the original equation wanting the term Ga, implies that ,v(Pg. .Pp )=P)-P (Pp . .Pp+l) +Qxe(PX-2..Pp+l)+Rxe(P -3p+l)+.-+Zxmv(Pxn.Pp+j). Now in order to verify the particular solution, ux=Gx+PxGx,+sv(PxPx-,)Gx2+6v(PXPX IPX-_2)Gr3+..+E,,(P,..Px p~l)Gx-p+.... it is only requisite that SV(Pp.. Pmv(P _PI=p+1)+QxV(Px* +P * p+ I)+Rxjv(P3 P3P 1p+*)* + Z V(Pav-n..P,-p+I); and this is true, for it is identical in form with the equation last above given, notwithstanding the occurrence of x in the lowest value of P, for this lowest value remains the same throughout the expression. 7. If PI=O, the expressions sv(P ...Px-m) reduce themselves to those terms which do not contain any value of P. It would not be difficult to determine generally what terms these are; but probably the most convenient general method of ar-riving at the solution in an algebraical form would be to make P, equal to a constant b, and to make b equal to zero in the result finally obtained. S. The above particular solution of the original equation is in such a form that the general term of the indefinite series representing the solution is given in explicit terms; but that general term may be represented in an implicit form, which perhaps is more convenient for practical use. By attending to the formation of the successive expressions SV(P,.. .Pm), it will readily be seen that the series M!/OGt + MGg_1 ? MG2? .g + MpGp +.. FINITE DIFFERENCES AND LINEAR DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS. 267 is a solution of the original equation, if ml= PXM0, M22=P _1M1 +QXM0, M3=PX-2M2+QXlMl +RM 0, MP=P=Xp+1Mp-1 + QX+2Mp-2 + Rxp+3Mp + . *+Wapn-1MP-n+1 + Zp+nMp7 in which last is a general relation determining the coefficient of any term from the coefficients of the n preceding terms; or from the coefficients of all the preceding terms when the number of these preceding terms is less than n. This relation is the equation of formation, and may be regarded as universal, bearing in mind that when p is less than n some of the terms of this relation vanish. The solution of the original equation is therefore reduced to that of a similar equation without second member: and, by what has preceded, this solution is MP=9V(PXP+...PX). it being understood that M -= 1; and this is the value of MP before given. But the value of Mp may be found otherwise, thus: Make PX-P,,+1PP Q7?p+2=Qp, &c. &c. Then the solution is evidently =p sv(Pp . . P')3 where the operation v has the same meaning as before, except that it is applied to the accented letters. Consequently MP= (PP'.. P') + AP +BP + Cp+ where Aplqp+Nrp +.E-zpln~ B : ,3(qP+1APl) + lEp(r-+1Ap2)+-..+Y2x (z, +Ap_,+1), and generally the terms are formed as stated in section 5, using p for x. 9. I shall conclude this part of the subject with a few simple examples for the purpose of illustrating the processes here given. Ex. 1. Let the equation be UX= aux1 + b2uv-2+GG. That part of the solution which is independent of Gx, is u =C{ax+(x-l )ax-2b2+ ( 2) (x -3)ax4b4+ (x-3) (z4) (x-5)a-6b6+... }; 2M2M 3 268 MR. HARGREAVE ON THE RESOLUTION OF LINEAR EQUATIONS IN and since in the present case Pf and Q, are constants, we have M=ap+(p )ap-2b 2J (p-2)(p-3) -4b4+ (p-3)(p-4)(p-5)aP-6b6+... whence the particular value of u, is a series of terms of the form Gx+aG( 1 + (a2+ b2)Gx-2+ (a'+2ab2)G + (a4 + 3a2b2+b4) G,4+ (a5+4a'b2+ 3ab4)G _i+. The difference in character between the solution proposed in this paper, and that which would result from a perfect analysis of the general equation, may be exemplified by the present instance. The perfect solution of this equation is known to be UpX= -P oMe H+-Gi +l AX+ where a and 3 are the roots of t2-at-h2=O, and each z introduces a constant. Now if the constants be made equal, and the expression be written at length, we shall obtain the form derived above. The expansion of the two terms within the parenthesis gives G++Cr+ 2G"_ + Zpl +..?cIG and Gx 0+0GX2+-'+0P+lGp+...+Cpt and if the difference of these be divided by a-13, we get G. + G,>-02 +....+ aP+10+ p.+' x Guy _ G+;* s a-P which is the same in effect as the result which we have obtained.

Solution of Djfferential Equations in Series. 10. I now proceed to point out a method by which the processes above indicated may be made to give solutions of certain general forms of linear differential equations. In a paper on Linear Differential Equations presented by me to the Royal Society, and which the Society has done me the honoutr to publish in the Philosophical Transactions (Part I. for 1848, p. 31), 1 have enunciated, and so far as is material to the present purpose, demonstrated the following theorem That if, in a linear differential expression p(x, D)u=X and its solution u +,(x, D)X, the letter x be changed into the operative symbol D and D into -x, we shall thus FINITE DIFFERENCES AND LINEAR DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS. 271 obtain another linear differential expression p(D, x)u=X, the solution of which will be u==41(D,-x)X. In the application of this theorem, care must be taken that the first-mentioned solution is so written that the operations included under the function 4, are not suppressed; and it must also be borne in mind that the expressions obtained by this interchange of symbols will not in all cases be obviously interpretable. For applications of this singular analytical process I beg leave to refer to the memoir above cited, where it is employed for the solution, in finite terms, of extensive classes of linear differential equations, and equations in finite differences. So far as the process is legitimate, it is to be observed that it is founded on reasoning of a purely analytical character. It does not in any manner whatever flow from the calculus of operations, or depend for its validity upon the soundness of the logical basis on which this calculus rests. Now it is a remarkable property of this mechanical interchange of symbols, that it instantaneously converts a linear equation in finite differences into a linear differential equation; so that wherever the former is soluble, the latter is soluble also, provided the result be intelligible, a condition always satisfied when the functions employed are rational algebraical functions. As an instance worthy of notice, let us take the example last above given (Ex. 6.). Bearing in mind that u__=s-nDU., the proposed interchange gives the equation (writing px for Pa), Iu+al@(D)(E~pu)+a~l0(D)p(D-1)(slvu)+..+anp(.D)..p(D-n+l)(s'nxu)=G; whose solution, therefore, depends upon that of v-ap(D) (s'v)e) onAG, a proposition established by Mr. BOOLE by the methods of the Calculus of Operations. I propose, therefore, now to employ this theorem of the interchange of symbols for the purpose of converting the forms of solution, above given, of equations in finite differences into the particular solutions of some general forms of differential equations; viz. those equations whose factors do not contain any irrational or transcendental functions of x, or contain them only in the form of series of ascending powers of X. 11.

Bearing in mind the equation p(D)(sP0)=-p.sP , we see at once that the first complementary solution is CJ8PJO(A0+ A1s1+ A2620 + * + Amsmo +* ) or Cixl'(Ao+Aix+A2X2+ . +A.am+ ) where AO= 1, and the law of formation of the coefficients is fo(p3l +rM)Am+fi(P +;m)Am._ +f2(P1 +m)Am-2+ .. +fr(p3 +m)Am-r=0; and the remaining complementary solutions merely require the substitution of 2.. successively for P,, with new constants. The reader will not fail to perceive the peculiarity of the series when an is unity, (which value it can always have when it is not zero); for in that case the roots of f0t=O are the natural numbers from 0 to n1 inclusive, so that the series begin respectively with the terms 1, x x2, ...x'nl. If an be zero, that is, if the factor of the highest differential coefficient of u do not contain an absolute term, then in order that the transformed equation may take the form (2.), it will be necessary to pass so outside the operative functions in each termr, and divide by E.f The initial functionfst will then be of the form bnl(t * * (t-n + I )) +an-1 (t. .0.(t-n +2))3 and I-I will be (go(D)) A1(sfn-1)OG). Similarly, if in addition to an being zero, we have also b, and a,,l respectively equal to zero, it will be necessary to pass r2s outside the operative functions, and divide by MDCCCL. 2 N 274 MR. HARGREAVE ON THE RESOLUTION OF LINEAR EQUATIONS IN 620; and so on if other terms of the factors are wanting. Thus we can in all cases obtain the transformed equation in the required shape; but in all the cases where coefficients thus vanish, there is the important qualification that f0t is no longer necessarily of the nth order; so that H does not necessarily contain the proper number of arbitrary constants. The consequences of this consideration will be afterwards developed; in the meantime we proceed to consider what modifications the series undergo wherefot has two or more equal roots. 12. If there should be two roots offot=O equal to PI, one series will be deficient; and it will be supplied as follows. The expression H, or (gf(D))>'(Sn0G), contains in that case a termim of the form k10lo'; and it is easily seen that @(D) (06g1O) 0dp(D) (sP10) + @'(D) (sP10). The wanting series is, therefore, klxPl{logx(1+A~x+A2x2+..)+(Ax+A2x2+ *.)}, where dAI &c 1l do, If there should be three roots off~t O equal to PI, two series will be deficient, one of which will be supplied as last mentioned; and the other by the introduction of the series k2e'{ (log X)2(l +Ax+A2r2+..)+2 logv(A'x+Axv2+. .)+(A'X+A A2+ .)}, d2 A where Al= d &c. ; for we have a term k2d26l1, and it is easily seen that p(D) (d0261 ) = d24(D)sP1O+ 20p(D)sP10+p'(D)sP10. And generally since, where there are p+1 equal roots P3I, we have terms Cl610-+Ikj10 + k2dO20lO?, ++ kp0P?1i and since @(D) (dPslo)= OPp(D)?l9+ pdP-p-'/(Ds?0+ p 2 d-"(D) sP10+ the deficient series will be supplied by the following, taken with a different constant for every value of p from unity upwards: kP~x {(log x)P( I +Alx+A2X2?..) +p(log x)P-'(A'lx+A2x2+..) apR-,.!

As a matter of convenience, when the equal roots are zero, a temporary nominal value should be given to them for the purpose of differentiating A,, &c. 13. Hitherto we have attended especially to the complementary solutions or in other words, regarded G as zero. The operations, however, indicated in (3.) may be readily performed when G is a rational function of x; which we will suppose to be FINITE DIFFERENCES AND LINEAR DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS. 275 cleared of fractions, and so cleared to consist of a set of terms axP.

This will undergo a slight alteration, as the incipient term will be of the formf0(D)(s("1r)0G), where r factors of (2.) vanish by reason of some of the constant coefficients a., &c. being zero. In like manner it would be easy to represent the series if G contained log x and its powers; but for most other forms it would be necessary to expand G in order to represent the series explicitly. The solution however is theoretically complete, since it consists solely in the performance of operations which are known explicit functions of D. 14. Before proceeding further with the main subject, I shall illustrate this process by a few examples. Ex. 1. Let the equation be CX)d2u du ( +b+c2x2) d,2+ (a1 + b1x) dx + aou = G. Referring to (2.), we have f0D=D(D-1), f1D=b2(D1)(D-2)+a1(D1), f2(D)=c2(D-2)(D-3) +b1(D-2)+aO; roots offot=O are 0 and 1.

HARGREAVE ON THE RESOLUTION OF LINEAR EQUATIONS IN The three laws of formation, which are here written down at length, are in substance the same; for from the last the others are made by merely writing the roots successively in lieu of D in the factors. Ex. 2. Let the equation be e)d2u du rXU (x2+q4) d +(x+px2+ 5qx) j+(px-n2+(4qr)x)u=G. Referring to (2.), we have in the first instance, ((D 2)2 _ 2) (S20u) +p(D 2) (E3u) + (q(D 4)D+49+r) 41u G, whence (D2 _n2)u+pD(60U) + (qD2+r) (20 u) =_20G; roots offot=O are n and -n.

The completeness of the preceding forms of solution depends, as above intimated, upon the circumstance that the functionfo(D) is of an order not lower than the order of the original equation. It may however be of a lower order, as would take place in the first of the examples above given, if a2 instead of being I were zero and b2 were also zero. Let the equation then be (Ex. 4.), 2 du+ (1 +blx) +aou=G. Referring to (2.), we have, in the first instance, (D 1) (sOu) +(c2(D-2) (D3) +b1(D 2)+ a0)(20) G or Du+(c2(D-1)(D-2)+b1(D-1)?ao)(+0 ) =?--G; so that f(D) is of the first order, and the root is zero. 278 MR. IARGREAVE ON THE RESOLUTION OF LINEAR EQUATIONS IN The only complementary function to be obtained is therefore U=C lefl-agox Io a(b, + ao)X2.3 a0(b1 +a0) (1.2c2+2b1+ ao)x3 +2 Jao(bl+ao)(1.2c2+2b,+ao)(2.3c2+3b,+ao)x4-...}) a series which is divergent, but which, as will also be seen afterwards, is finite when the constant coefficients are connected by the formula (p -I )pc2+pbl+a,=O, p being any positive integer. Further, it may happen that the series obtained by the process, even when they afford a complete solution in respect of the number of constants, are divergent for all or for some values of a. This may evidently be the case in the solution of the second of the examples above given; for the law of the coefficients, as we advance in the series, approximates to A.= qA7-2. In these cases, other solutions in series may be obtained by resolving the equation in finite differences in a series of terms of the form H,+, instead of Hop. In order to effect this, all that is necessary is to write d+r for 0, (rY being the order of the equation in finite differences), and to divide by the factor of the last term instead of the factor of the first term; or in other words, we must pass fr outside the functions in (2.), and multiply bv -rO; so that this equation now assumes the form fr(D)U+fii (D) (u-u) +fr_2(D) (S-2GU) + _(n-r)OG. and the equation in finite differences is f.(0)U0+fr-(O)u0+? +fr-2(O)UO+2+. .=Go+r-n, We have now to inquire for the roots offrtO; the incipient term is (f.(D))y(sen `0G), which call H,; and the particular solution will be found to be uz=40(D) H1 +a-091 (D)i1, + a-2042(D)H, +.. +C-"Sm-(D)H1 + .., where -AO(D)=I1, andfr(D-mz)%P(D) +fr-,(D-m)47-l,,(D)+ * * =0 is the law of the formation of the operative functions. The substitution of the roots offt successively for D gives the law of formation of the complementary series. Taking the last example, the transformed equation now becomes (c2D(D-' l)+bD+ao)u+(D+ 1)(S-0u)=S-20G.

In like manner the particular solution is easily represented. 16. We are now in a position to discuss the character of the various series obtained by this process with reference to their convergency or divergency, a subject of the highest importance to the value of the process. The investigations which follow will, it is apprehended, be found to afford a complete test of the nature of the series 280 MR. HARGREAVE ON THE RESOLUTION OF LINEAR EQUATIONS IN In general, it will of course be understood that these researches, as to convergency and divergency, relate only to the complementary series, or in other words, to equations deprived of their second member; nevertheless they will to a great extent, if not throughout, apply to cases in which the second member is in the form of integer powers of x or of log X. I st. When in the set of functions fo(D), f 1(D), f2(D), .. .fr_(D), fr(D), the functionfi(D) is of a higher dimension with regard to D than any other of the set, or is what we shall here call the dominant function, the solution of the equation can always be found in a convergent series of ascending powers of x; and if in such a case we solve the equation in a series of descending powers of x, which we can do if we please, that series is certainly divergent. This is immediately apparent from the consideration of the law of the coefficients fo(pi+m)Am+fi(li+m)Am-n+. .+fr(ipl+m)Am-r=?; which, as m increases without limit, approaches to the form AmrI=?A -2A . or rnwrA=-gam _-bA_-... , f~m rn-I f~m 2, ~ M ____ n __ .... assuming that all the functions are only one degree lower than Am, which is the least favourable case for convergency. Therefore, if the largest of the terms of the righthand side of this equation be 41,Am-pp we have Amr< Am-P and we can therefore arrive at a point in the series at which the ratio of the coefficient of xm to that of xm-P diminishes without limit. It will also be observed that the series introduced by two or more equal roots are of the same character as the original series from which they are derived; for, Am being dAm dAm dh of the form 9(3,+m), we have d131 dm; and when A.-p is of a higher order with reference to mn than A dm P is also of a higher order than dam nd so for the other difrnl dm din' ferential coefficients. AWe have now merely to inquire what must be the form of the original equation thatfo(D) may be the dominant function. Referring to (2.), we see that it is necessary that the factor of the highest differential coefficient of u should contain one term only. If this factor be 1 or X, no restriction need be imposed on the succeeding factors. If it be x2, the factor of the next lower differential coefficient must not contain an absolute term ; and generally, if xP be the factor of den the factor of dxn-1 must begin with a term not lower than xP-1. that of with a term not lower than xP-2, and so on.

When in the set of functions f(D)~ fr-l(D)j ...fi(D)) go(D)) the functionf(D) is the dominant function, the solution of the equation can always be found in a convergent series of descending powers of x; and if in such a case we solve the equation in a series of ascending powers of x, that series is certainly divergent.

On proceeding to inquire what must be the form of the original equation, we see again that it is necessary that the factor of the highest differential coefficient of u should contain one term only.

In short, for all integer values of p the equation dv V b pal) +hn d -2 is soluble in a convergent series of descending powers of x. The 4th example above given is an instance of this form. 3rdly. When in the set of functions fo(D), f (D), ... .f1(D),j f(D), the functionsfo(D) and fAD) are of the same dimensions, and are both dominant over all the other functions, the solution of the equation can be found in a series of ascending powers of x, which for some values of x is convergent, and for other values of x is divergent; and the solution can also be found in a series of descending powers of x which is divergent for all values of x for which the other series is convergent, and convergent for all values of x for which the other series is divergent. For in the ascending series the law of the coefficients approaches the form, (the MnCCCL. 2 0 282 MR.

When in the set of functions fo(D), f (D), * * *r_j(D).s fr(D)> one or more of the intermediate functions is or are of the same order as the extreme functionsfo(D) andf.(D), or as the highest of these two when they differ in dimflensions, the series obtained by the above processes will be divergent for some values of x, and we have not as yet any method of deriving a convergent series corresponding to these values; and if one or more of the intermediate functions be of a higher dimension than the extreme functions, the series obtained by the above processes will certainly be divergent. These remaining cases therefore sever into two species; first, where some of the intermediate functions are of the same order as the highest of the extreme functions; secondly, where one or more of the intermediate functions are dominant. The first of these species includes equations of the two following forms: (atoP + bnxP' at ++ l xaP) d~nU + (a,-_,xP + bn lxp, + P ) d~nlu+. + (atoxP n+.. .)U= On dein which there can be no function higher thanfo(D); and (a, + bx+. + x2P) dnu +(an l+b dn 'u = in which there can be no function higher thanfr(D). In these cases it will easily be seen that the law of the coefficients of the ascending series, as mn increases without limit, approximates to aAm + bnA l+ In Am pO FINITE DIFFERENCES AND LINEAR DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS. 283 and the series therefore approaches without limit to a recurring series, in which the constants of relation are by en 2 'n an an' an and the denominator of the rational fraction, to which the residue of the series approaches, is -(an+bnX+ *..+InX). In the descending series, the law of the coefficients approximates to InAm+knAm =+ *+anAm-p0, and the series approaches without limit to a recurring series, in which the constants of relation are kn I bn 1 an I Inn XP-1 , In P and the denominator of the rational fraction, to which the residue of the series approaches, is lP(a. + bx + .+ IxP). Whenf0(D) is higher than f(D), the ascending series alone can be used; when fr(D) is higher than f0(D), the descending series alone can be used; and when fo(D) and fr(D) are of the same dimension, either may be used; and the approximations above referred to render it probable that these series, notwithstanding that they may be divergent, are the developments of continuous algebraical expressions. The second of the species above referred to includes all equations which are excluded from the preceding forms; that is, all forms which transgress both the restrictions to which the equation in the third case is subjected. Of these forms, the solutions, whether obtained in ascending or in descending series, are always divergent; and the divergency appears to be of an extreme and unmanageable character. In this case we have an intermediate dominant function; and the convergent solutions might, from considerations of analogy, be presumed to be series infinite in both directions, the roots of the dominant function determining the incipient terms.

Throughout the preceding investigations, the series obtained by the processes here displayed undergo a modification of form. in the event of the expressionfOt or frt, as the case may be, having one or more sets of imaginary roots. Let there be a couple of such roots of the form o+PV/1. In the ascending series these roots give cixO+P 1 (Ao+Aix+A2 2+ +AmX+..\ C XCPV-(Bo+Blx+B2x2+ .+Bmxm+..), where fo(v-+rn+PV-I)Am+fi(vc+m+pV3^)Am-l+ ... = and fio(v+ m-0AV/)Bm+fi(t+ml-P/-V1)Bmi_+ =0 are the respective laws of formation. It is apparent, therefore, that if Am be of the form n(oc+I3V-1), Bm is of the forin Making c2=c1, and remembering that <*jr-+ x-Vv-1= 2 cos (P logx) Am A = _2V-I sin (P3logx), the sum of the two series gives the double series, 2c1<ocos (p logx){AO+Bo+(Al+Bl)x+.. +(Am+Bm)xm+ **} + /-i sin (3logx){A,-Bo+(Al-Bl)x+..+(Am-Bm)xm+..}); which is necessarily real, since Am+Bm is purely real, and Am Bm is purely imaginary. Making now clc2, the sum of the two series gives another double series, (making 2kxa( V-lcos (( log x) {AOB0+(Al --Bl)x+** +(Am Bm)xm+ .} + sin (p(3 log x) {AO+Bo (A+Bl)x+ .+ (Am+Bm)cm+ .. }) which is likewise real. The descending series may be treated in a similar manner. 18. Most of the examples to which the preceding processes are applied have been taken from the paper in the Philosophical Transactions for 1844, in which Mr. BOOLE developed his new General Method in Analysis, with which the subject matter of the present paper is closely connected though the methods exhibited are distinct; unless indeed it should prove, that the interchange of the symbol of operation and the independent variable, and the general relation exhibited by Mr. BOOLE's fundamental theorem of development connecting any system of linear differential equations with a corresponding system of equations in finite differences, are merely different representations of a part of some more general method or process. The principal difference in results, so far as concerns the solution in series of linear differential Sequations, appears to bee, that in this paper the law of relation of the FINI TE DIFFERENCES AND LINEAR DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS. 285 coefficients of each series is distinct, and substantially the same in form for all; and that it is not necessary to have recourse to the method of parameters in the cases of equal roots, or in the case of there being a term G on the right-hand side of the equation. In the case of imaginary roots, the laws of the series are in the first instance distinct from each other, and afterwards combined in couples. 19. The investigations contained in the latter part of this paper reduce the problem of the integration in finite terms of the general linear differential equation with rational coefficients, to the finding of an algebraical expression representing the development Ao+Aix+A2X2+.... + Amxm+ . . where A,= 1, and the law of relation is fonzAm+fimAml+A2mAm-2+ A +frAmr=Ov the functions fgfif2-.f being known specific functions. The series to be sunmmed closely resembles a recurring series; it differs from it in this particular, that the law of relation, instead of being constant, has a uniform and simple variation as it progresses along the series. If the rational coefficients should be thernselves infinite series, the process still applies, the only difference being that each term would be formed from all the preceding terms, instead of being formed from the r immediately preceding terms, or from all the preceding terms when the number of them is less than r. In those cases in which the equation is soluble in finite terms by known methods, we are enabled to assign the algebraical expression for the series; a result which may be used for the discovery of generating functions. Thus, taking the general equation of the first order, (a, + bx +c1x2 + .. + 4n) .+ (a0+=bx +CO2? . . +ko )u= O, we see that rea + boxb . + koxn-I1 f alo+bl+. +klxn dx =A.o+Alx+A2x2+ ..+Amem+.. where A,= 1, and the general law of the series is aimAm+ (bj(m1) +ao)Am._+ (c1(m-2) +bo)Am-2+ .

If we take the general equation of the second order, (a2+b ~ d~u du +a~o+.+h~-)U=0 (a2 +b2x+ .. +4e) W.+ (a,+blx+ ..+k1 '45+(a0+box+ .k.? dox)u=0O the law of the series will be arnm(m-1 )Am + (b2(MI)(mn-2) +aj(m-r ))Am..J+(c2(m-2)(mn-3) +bj(m-2) +ao)A.-,2+.. + ( 1(m-n)(m-n1) +k,(m-n) +ho)Am-nO; and generally, in equations of the nth order, the law of relation involves the nth power of ms the number of the terma sought for. Thus the determination of soluble 286 MR. HARGREAVE ON THE RESOLUTION OF LINEAR EQUATIONS, ETC. cases of linear equations resolves itself into the inquiry, in what cases can a series whose scale is of the nth order be resolved into a number of series whose scale is of the first order. 20. 1 have not thought it necessary here to extend these solutions in series to linear partial differential equations. The process by which the extension can be made is well known, and has no peculiar relation to the methods here developed.
