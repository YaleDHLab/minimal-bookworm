VI. An Observation of a Tumor on the Neck, full of Hydatides, cured by Mr Anthony Hewnden, Surgeon: Communicated by Dr Edw. Tyson, F. R. S. A Gentlewoman in London, aged 25 years, had a large Wenny Tumor, the Basis taking its Origin from all the lower hinder part of the Skull, stretching down the Neck near each Jugular, extending it self almost as low as both Scapula's; on the upper part was a Phlegmon. The Radix being so large, I put on a transverse Caustick the length and breadth of the Tumor, intending to separate the Cutis from the Membrane of the ~; but it being so thin where the Phlegmon was, oblig'd me to divide the Cistis; out of which I sav'd above threescore Hydatides, of the bigness of a small Wallnut: Several more were broken. These Hydatides swum in a Liquor of the consistence of Whites of Eggs. In this Cistis I found a large quantity of ~ and Steatomatous Matter, at the ~ a large Sarcoma;the greatest part I cut off,but fearing to ~ the ~ of the Neck, deferr'd it to the next ~, ~ (2345) intending to take the rest of the Sarcoma, and Radix of the Cistis away by Caustical Medicines, which I applyed without success, they coming off without making an Eschar, the Radix being of a Cartilagenous substance: searching with my Probe to find some Interstice, it dropt into one; and touching some Membranous or Nervous Body, caus'd the Patient to cry out furiously; into which Interstice I put a piece of Roman Vitriol fitted for the place, which came out the next day all dissolved with some of the Radix: By the continual applying of the Vitriol, I extirpated the whole Radix, and healed the whole S. A. Two Observations belong to this worthy of knowing: The one is, Seven years before this Operation, this Tumor was very near so big, and subsided of itself. The other is, when I began with Caustical Medicines~ the first I used was Praecip. rub. which I cover'd the whole Radix with, which came off and no Eschar, but it salivated the Patient for 5 weeks.
