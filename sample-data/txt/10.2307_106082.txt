[104] XIII. Extract of two Letters from M. Messier, of the Royal Academy of Sciences, and F. R. S. to M. de Magalhaens, on a new Comet: Translated by Dr. Bevis, F. R. S. PLEASE, Sir, to inform the Royal Society, that I discovered a new Comet, the 10th of Jan. instant, 1771, about eight o'clock in the evening; it was between the head of Hydra and the Little Dog, over the parallel of Procyon. The position whereof I determined by comparing it with that star, and the star ~ in Hydra. The observations are as follow: Read Jan. 24, and Feb. 1, 1771. h m s The 10th of Jan. 1771, at 10 16 45 true time. 1st Right Ascens. of the Comet 121~ 47 16 Obs. North Declination 5 21 15 Same night at 21 19 5 2d Right Ascens. of the Comet 120 24 31 Obs. North Declination 6 4 46 From which observations it appears, that in 3h 2~ 20~ of time its motion in right ascens. was 1~ 22~ 45~ and 43~ 31~ in declination: this comet was perceived by the bare eye. In the telescope its nucleus is bright, of a whitish complexion, and not very well defined, surrounded with an atmosphere several minutes wide, with a faint tail 5 or 6 degrees long. Its apparent motion among the fixt stars con4 trary [105] trary to the order of signs, from the equator towards the North pole. This makes the twelfth Comet I have discovered and observed in thirteen years past. W I T H O U T what I had done the 10th of January for determining the position, and forming any tolerable conjecture of the direction of the motion of the comet, it would have been impossible for me to have found it afterwards; for from the 10th to the 16th the sky was every night quite clouded, during which the light of the comet had extremely abated, and its motion decreased, insomuch that between the 16th and 17th of January the sky clearing, I sought for it two hours, without finding it; but though with little hopes of seeing it, I sought for it in Perseus and Andromeda. After a world of useless pains and look-outs, at length I saw it again, between the horns of the Bull, of a very feeble light: and it was necessary to be acquainted with the heavens as well as I was, to find where it was; nor have any of our astronomers, as far as I can yet learn, succeeded in their attempts. I observed it January 10th, 16th, 17th and 20th, on which last day it was extremely close to the planet Mars, less than a minute of time, both in right ascension and declination, and its light so languid as to be in a manner extinguished by that of Mars. Without that excellent telescope which you procured for M. le President de Saron, I should not have perceived it with any of my instruments. Here follow my observations, which may possibly turn out the only good ones, and which I intreat you to lay before the Royal Society. VOL. LXI. P 1771 [106] 1771 True Time.
