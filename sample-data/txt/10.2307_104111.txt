VII. An Account of an extraordinary Eruption of Mount Vesuvius in the Month of March, in the Year 1730, extracted from the Meteorological Diary of that Year at Naples, communicated by Nichol. Cyrillus, M. D. R. S. S. T H E Thermometer used in this Diary, was made by Mr. Hauksbee, in which the Freezing-Point is marked at 65 Degrees under the Point extreme Hot; but the Doctor observes, that at Naples Water will freeze when this Thermometer stands at 55 Degrees only: Which, he is of Opinion, seems to argue, that there is something else besides an intense Degree of Cold required for freezing Water; that the Air of Naples abounds in it, more than the Air of London; and that this may probably be of a saline Nature; because when we turn Water into Ice by the Help of Snow, it is necessary to mix Salt with it.
