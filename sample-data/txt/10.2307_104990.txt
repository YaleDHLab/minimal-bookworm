XCVII. Extract of a Letter from the Rev. Mr. Holdsworth, at Dartmouth, relating to the Agitation of the Waters observed there on the 1st of November, 1755. Communicated by the Rev. Jeremiah Milles, D. D. F. R. S. I Have enquired particularly of our pilot-men, and others concerning the tides in this harbour, who unanimously, agree that there was a surprizing agitation in the waters about nine in the morning on the first day of November last, when there was a great and sudden swell; and though there was but little wind, yet the boats, riding near the mouth of the river, tumbled and tossed as if they would have leaped into each other; and two of them broke loose from their moorings. During this fermentation (or boiling of the sea like a pot, as my informant expresses himself) though it was four hours ebb, the waters rose as high, or higher than they usually do on the highest spring tide. This violent Read May 13, 1756. [644] violent <inferred>motion</inferred> lasted about three quarters of an hour, and then the waters fell to their usual height at that time of the tide, and have continued to flow and ebb ever since without any perceivable alteration. I am, Reverend Sir, Your most obedient servant, Dartmouth, April 30, 1756. Henry Holdsworth. It appears by this account, that the agitation of the waters observed at Ilfarcombe, on the 27th of February last, was not perceived on the southern coast of Devonshire. XCVIII.
