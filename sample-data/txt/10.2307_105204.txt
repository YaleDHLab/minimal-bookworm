XC. Extract of a Letter from John Henry Winkler, Professor of Natural Philosophy at Leipsic, and Fellow of the Royal Society, to Thomas Birch, D. D. Secretary of the Royal Society, relating to Two electrical Experiments; translated from the Latin. Leipsic, May 22, 1754. I Transmit to you, Sir, the account of two electrical experiments, both which I made the present year. They are founded upon the famous experiment of Leyden. On January 8, I sprinkled a plate of metal with the seeds of * club-moss. To this plate I connected a chain, which communicated with the coating of the Leyden bottle of water. I afterwards sufficiently electrised this water to make the artificial thunder, * Lycopodium, Club-moss, Wolf's-claw. of Read July 4, 1754. [773] of which I gave an account in my treatise de avertendi fulminis artificio, page 10 and 11. Having drawn these seeds together on a heap upon the plate, I brought over them the sphere of metal, the size of which is arbitrary, impregnated with this electricity. Upon bringing this sphere near the plate, the electricity exploded, by which the seeds were set all on fire. These seeds were dry, and had no inflammable spirit mixed with them. The flame which arose from these seeds is true fire, as it lighted some flax, which lay upon the seeds, and extended itself beyond the metal. On the 13th of January I put some aurum fulminans upon a circular piece of parchment: this parchment I cemented to a plate of metal, and caused the bottle replete with electricity to be discharged thereupon. Immediately the aurum fulminans exploded with a very loud report, and the circle of parchment was torn all to pieces.
