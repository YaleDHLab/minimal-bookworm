[ 293 ] XV. On Systems of Linear Indeterminate Ejuations and Congruences. By HENRY J. STEPHEN SMITH, AlL.A., Fellow and lllathemaitical Lecturer of Balliol College, Oxford. Communicated by J. J. SYLVESTER, Esq., F.B.S. Received January 17,-Read January 31, 1861. THE theory of the solution, in positive or negative integral numbers, of systems of linear indeterminate equations, requires the consideration of rectangular matrices, the constituents of which are integral numbers. It will therefore be convenient to explain the meaning which we shall attach to certain phrases and symbols relating to such matrices. A matrix containing p constituents in every horizontal row, and q in every vertical column, is a matrix of the type q Xp. We shall employ the symbol q X-P | or (when it is not necessary that the type of the matrix should be indicated in its symbol) the simpler symbol JJAJj to represent the matrix A2,1,A2,2 A2, q, 1 q,2 Aq,p If JjAJJ and JIBI be two matrices of the same type, the equation JJA J=J B1J indicates that the constituents of HAIj are respectively equal to the constituents of JIBI ; whereas the equation JA = BJ will merely express that the determinants of JJAI] are equal to the corresponding determinants of JJB ]. The determinants of a matrix are, of course, the determinants of the greatest square matrices contained in it; similarly, its minor determinants of order i are the determinants of the square matrices of the type i X i that are contained in it. Matrices of the types n X (m+ n) and m x (m+n) are said to be of complementary types; if JJAJJ and I BJJ be two such matrices, we Thall employ the equation to express that each determinant of JJAll is equal to that determinant of IiE3B, by which it is multiplied in the development of the determinant of the square matrix B When A B in and n are both uneven numbers, the signs of the determinants B and B are different: this occasions a certain ambiguity of sign in the interpretation of the equation lA!_ BJ, which, however, will occasion no inconvenience. If mn=n, the matrices JtAil and J'BJJ are at once of the same, and of complementary types; so that, in this case, the equation lAi=IBl may stand for either of two very different sets of equations; but this MDCCCLxJ. 2 S 294 xMR. H. J. S. SMITH ON SYSTEMS OF LINEAR also is an imperfection of the notation here employed, which it is sufficient to have pointed out. If D denote any quantity whatever, it is hardly necessary to state that the equality IAI-k x IBI implies that the determinants of 11AIj are respectively k times the corresponding determinants of JIBI!. Let 11P11 be a square matrix of the type n X n, and 11QI! a matrix of the type n X (n+mT) (where m>-O), we shall understand by the matrix compounded of 11P11 and j1Qll, the matrix ]XJJ of the same type as IIQII, the constituents of which are defined by the equation Xi, = Pi,,I Ql,+Pi, 2 Q2, ?.+ * +Pi, n Qn i; and we shall write 11XII P1 X 1Q11; in this equation 1QI is said to be premultiplied by 1lPIl, and 11P11 to be post-multiplied by IQi This definition will suffice for our present purpose; as the only case of composition which, we shall have to consider, is that in which the vertical dimensions of the matrices to be compounded are all equal, and in which every premultiplying matrix is square, so that if an oblong matrix present itself at all in a series of matrices to be compounded, it will occupy the last place in the series. By the greatest divisor of a matrix we are to understand the greatest common divisor of the determinants of the matrix. If the matrix be square, its greatest divisor is, consequently, the determinant of the matrix. A prime matrix is one of which the greatest divisor is unity; b i. e. the determinants of which are relatively prime. A prime square matrix (i. e. a matrix of which the determinant is unity) we shall call a unit-matrix. In any system of linear equations, whether defective or redundant, or neither, we shall understand by the matrix of the system the matrix formed by the coefficients of the unknown quantities. If to this matrix we add an additional vertical column, conposed of the absolute terms of the equations, the resulting matrix we shall term (for brevity) the augmented matrix of the system. Lastly, when we have occasion to consider square matrices, the constituents of which, excepting those on the principal diameter, are zero, we shall represent them by symbols of the form I1)q q21 q39 .. . 9 where q1, q2, ... qn are the constituents of the principal diameter. Art. 2. If every determinant of the augmented matrix of a redundant system of linear equations is equal to zero, while the determinants of the unaugmented matrix are not all equal to zero, the system admits of one solution, and one only. And in particular if the matrix of the system be a prime matrix, the values of the unknown quantities which satisfy the system are integral numbers. For these values may be expressed as fractions having for their denominators any one of the determinants of the matrix; and these determinants are relatively prime. INDETERMINATE EQUATIONS AND CONGRUENCES. 295 Let 1 AJJ be a given prime matrix of the type n X (n + n), 1jKJJ a given matrix of the same type connected with 11AII by the equation K =k X A..(1.) which/ implies that k is the greatest divisor of !KII; then the symbolic equation IKII1= jkjj x AII,.(2.) in which jjkjj denotes a square matrix of the type t X n, will admit of one solution, and one only. For, to determine kr, 15 Air, 25... Der, 5 the constituents of the rth horizontal row of f1k J, we have the redundant system K~r, i=Al, i kn 1+A2, i r, 2+ *. + An, i k, nW\ i=L, 2, 3,...nm J .( which is involved in the symbolic equation (2.). The matrix of this system is the prime matrix JJA' ; and the determinants of its augmented matrix are all equal to zero; for, by virtue of equation (1.), they are equal to the determinants Kr, 19 Kr, 2 a . . . I.Kr, news C Ki,2 K2, -sCX I1, 1I K,,25 * 2, n+M K2,1, K2,25....K2,n+m Kn~,1 Kna l,25 nn+m in which two horizontal rows are identical. Thus the system (3.), and consequently the equation (2.), admits of one solution, and one only. It is evident that the determinant of jjkjj is k. The case in which m=0 is not included in this demonstration; its proof, however, presents no difficulty, and may be omitted here. A particular case of this theorem (that in which n=2) occurs in the ' Disquisitiones Arithmeticse' (see art. 234 of that work). Art. 3. If every determinant of the augmented matrix of a redundant system of linear congruences be divisible by the modulus, while the greatest divisor of the unaugmented matrix is prime to the modulus, the system is resoluble and admits of only one solution. For if the modulus be represented by P x QX R. ..., PI Q, CR.. denoting powers of unequal primes, one (at least) of the determinants of the unaugmented matrix is prime to P, one (at least) is prime to Q, &c.; whence it may be inferred that the system is resoluble for each of the modules P, Q, R..., and admits of only one solution for each of them; it is therefore resoluble for their product P x Qx ..., and admits of only one solution for that modulus. Let IJKJJ denote (as in the preceding article) a given matrix of the type n>X (n+m), of which k is the greatest divisor; and let it be required to find the complete solution of the symbolic equation jJK~j=jjkjjx Ajj, (4.) in which 11h is a square matrix of which the determinant is k, JjAhj a prime matrix of 2 s2 296 MR. H. J. S. SMITH ON SYSTEMS OF LINEAR the same type as 1IKI!, and in which the constituents of J1AJJ and jjklj are the unknown numbers. We shall first obtain a particular solution of this equation, and then show how from any particular solution the complete solution may be deduced. We may suppose that the constituents of any horizontal row of jJKJJ admit of no common divisor but unity; for if 6, a I be the greatest common divisors of the constituents of the horizontal rows of 1KIj, we find liKII-Ij l1 X 2 5 x 3 n jX||K |1jX(5.) JIK'Ii denoting a matrix the constituents of which are derived from those of jJKjf by the relation Kr,, S = Fr Kr, 8 ~~~~~~(6.) so that the solution of equation (4.) depends on the solution of a similar equation for the matrix jjK'jj, in which the constituents of each horizontal row are relatively prime. Let then the matrix irxK m) . e. the matrix K1 1K 1{ ,.... KK1, n+m K2, 15 K2,2.K, , + [1rn], Kr, 1? Kr, 2 . Kr,,n+m be a prime matrix, but let the matrix (r+1) >(n+m) admit of a greatest divisor K Determine o c, Ber w, by the system of congruences, K, W K2,i W rKii mod. a, a=-11 2 3, ... n+m J.) (which, as we have just seen, is always resoluble), and in JIK!! replace the constituents Kr+i, by the numbers [Kr+3,,-Zlss] we thus deduce from jfKjj another matrix fjK'jj connected with it by the relation JKJ="pi x jK"j, and such that the matrix of its first r+1 horizontal rows is prime. By proceeding in this manner, we shall at last obtain a prime matrix IA.1!, which satisfies the equation iKI=k>x Aj,. we may then, by the method of the last article, determine a square matrix J1kQJ1 satisfying the equation l!KI!=!kkoj! X IIA4X *.(8.) and thus obtain a particular solution of the proposed equation (4.). To deduce the general solution of that equation, let Ilk,1! and IA,1! be any two matrices satisfying it. We have therefore the equality lx !!Ajj!I=j!k0!j X IjA.0!,. (9.) INDETERMINATE EQUATIONS AND CONGRUENCES. 297 which evidently implies that whence, by the theorem of the last article, ila1 denoting a unit-matrix. Combining (9.) and (11.), we find Ilk, 11 X lisaIl X IJAOJI lkoll X gIAOJI Z e Z (s12.) whence, by the same theorem, it follows that Ilk, 1| X ||oa|| = Ilkoll; * C . . e m (13 or, which is the same thing, jkljl=llkol x ll-' . . ... . (14.) cJlj' denoting the matrix reciprocal to l1*ll. The complete solution of equation (4.) is therefore contained in the formulae IjI=tK1IxIa Il..J.(16.) a1ll denoting an arbitrary unit-mnatrix of the type n X n, and IIAol1 Ilkojl being any two matrices that satisfy the equation. In this, as in the preceding article, we have for simplicity excluded the case in which mO, and the matrices JJKJI and 1A1I are squares. But it is readily seen that no exception is presented by this particular case. Art. 4. Let Ai, Ix, +Ai, 2 X2+ I. -+Ai, n+M Xln+m=O, i-15 2; 3, X. }n 1 represent a system of indeterminate equations of which the matrix is I1AII. We shall suppose that the determinants of IjAtI are not all equal to zero, i. e. that the system is independent; so that its index of indeterminateness (or the excess of the number of indeterminates above the number of really independent equations) is m. If we take r solutions of the system, for example the solutions S 1 Xs, 21 s, 3 .. s,.(17 .) s2,,.r j it is evident that if r > m, the determinants of the matrix I'xJl are all equal to zero. If r-< m, and if the determinants of the matrix I1xjI be not all equal to zero, the solutions (17.) are said to form a set of r independent solutions; if r=m, they form a complete set of independent solutions. A set of relatively, prime solutions is an independent set of which the matrix is prime; a complete set of relatively prime solutions may be called, for a reason which will presently appear, a fundamental set of solutions. It is always possible, in an infinite number of ways, to assign complete sets of independent solutions of a system of equations of the form (16.). Among the methods by which this may be accomplished, we shall select one which depends on the following principle:298 M1R. H. J. S. SMITH ON SYSTEMS OF LINEAR {f !jr >K (m+r)" represent any matrix of the type r X (m+ r), the determinants of which are not all equal to zero, and if x1) . m+r be integers which satisfy the equations ^2k~l ai,*/;L=05} . 5 9 . . .(18.) *k r,01 while , a?.+,, al,3 a,+ ,, , mr are integers satisfying the inequality the determinants of the matrix (r?1) x (m+r) are not all equal to zero. Fhor if #-l?r t'+1, k x =) 0, it is evident that by combining this equation with the equations (18.), we may express each of the determinants OX rX(m+r)| in succession as a linear function of the determinants of (r+1) X (mir| If, therefore, the former deterxninants do not all vanish, neither can the latter. Let, then, am, 1, am,2, am, n+m represent any particular solution (other, of course, than that in which every indeterminate is equal to zero) of the system (16.); and let A21+1, A +1, S . . A +1, + be integral numbers satisfying the inequality Ik-nr+m A m, < ,; , , a X X (20.) the system Ai, I x, +Ai, 2 X2+ * AT, 17+fN X.+-? . . 0 2. I-=1 2, 3, ..s n+1 (which is obtained by the addition of a single equation to the system (16.)) is itself an independent system, as appears from the principle just enunciated; its index of index terminateness is therefore qn-1. Let a(1) (f+rn) represent a complete set of independent solutions of (21.); it may then be inferred, from a second application of the same principle, that rn X (n+rn) represents a complete set of independent solutions of the proposed system (16.). Thus the determination of a complete set of independent solutions of a system of which the index of indeterminateness is m, depends on the determination of a similar set of solutions for a system of which the index is lower by a unit. By successive reductions, therefore, we shall at last arrive at a system of which the index of indeterminateness is unity, the complete solution of which is of course immediately found by evaluating the determinants of its matrix. The practical application of this method supposes only that we can always assign a particular solution of a system of the form (16.) or (21.). And this, it may be observed, INDETERMINATE EQUATIONS AND CONGRUENCES. 299 can always be done, either by trial, or by other obvious and not unsymmetrical expedients. Art. 5. If Ilall represent the matrix of a complete set of independent solutions of the proposed system (16.), and Jlbll be any matrix of the same type as Ilall, and connected with fall by the equation IfbllKjlklj X Ilal, (22.) in which IfkII denotes a square matrix of which the determinant is not zero, it is evident that the constituents of JIbIf are also a complete set of independent solutions. And, conversely, if jlbII be the matrix of a complete set of independent solutions, lall is also the matrix of a similar set. For if IJKfI be the matrix composed of the first minors of 1k1ll, so that IlKII Xllkl= Ilk, I le,I . .. . we have from (22.), IIKIlx llbfll= lk, kI , ... k, k xl;xllall; from which it appears that Ilk, I, . .. .11 X Ilall, and therefore Ilall itself, is the matrix of an independent set of solutions. This observation enables us to obtain a complete set of relatively prime solutions, as soon as we have obtained an independent set. If Ifbll be the matrix of the independent set, we have only to determine, by the method of art. 3, a square matrix Iv, and an oblong prime matrix 11all, satisfying the equation 6IbIj = Ivk X Ilall the constituents of Cal are then the terms of a set of fundamental solutions. Or again, if in art. 4 we employ, instead of the inequality (19.), the equation k=. *.(23.) it is easily shown that if rx ("+A)l be a prime matrix, I(r+1)x (n+r) is also a Ia . a prime matrix; so that, by following the method of that article, we may obtain directly a set of fundamental solutions of any proposed system. Only, it will be observed, that in this mode of obtaining such a set, we suppose that we can assign particular solutions, not only of systems of the form (16.), but also of equations of the form (23.). Art. 6. The importance of fundamental sets of solutions in the theory of linear indeterminate equations is evident from the following proposition: "If Ilall represent a set of fundamental solutions of the system (16.), the complete solution of that system is contained in the formula Xi k2 d , . i=1, 2, 3, ... n+m( in which ( 2, . , are absolutely indeterminate integral numbers." For it is evident that every set of numbers included in (24.) satisfies (16.); and, conversely, if am.-, -, amA,2, . ... a-1, n1rm be any solution of (16.), the determinants of the 300 MR. l. J. S. SMITH ON SYSTEMS OF LINEAR matrix a(m+1)X(n+m) are all zero, while the -matrix rnx(ntm4) is prime; whence, by a principle employed in art. 2, the system atm + I, &!= k4k Ck, i i_1, 2, 3 ... n m is satisfied by one, and only one system of integral values of g, : . e or, which is the same thing, the numbers am-i -, amZ+,2, .5 am.+,,+m are included in the formula (24.). It may be added, that no fractional values of , . can give integral values to 'l, X2*.. x xn+m; and that the same values of xl) x2, b ,m cannot arise from different values of it *' The converse of the proposition just established is also true; i. e. "1 If the formula Xik=m ekad, i . . * . . (24.) represent every solution of an indeterminate system of equations, the matrix tall is. a prine matrix." For if fbJJ represent a set of fundamental solutions of the indeterminate system, we may express the constituents of Itbil as linear functions of the constituents of 11ail, by means of the equations (24.), so as to obtain an equation of the form 11bIl-l,= x flail, d denoting a square matrix; whence it immediately appears that liar is a prime matrix and ' a unit-matrix. Thus, if we apply EULERSs method for the resolution of indeterminate equations to the system (16.), we obtain, as the final result of the process, a system of equations of the form (24.); and as it is demonstrable, from the nature of the method itself, that these final equations contain the complete solution of the proposed system, their matrix is a prime matrix. If tall and ffb6) be any two sets of fundamental solutions ef the same system, we shall have the equation -4 = 1i X lia)l, )t;) denoting a unit-matrix. The matrices, therefore, of all sets of fundamental solutions are deducible, by premultiplication with unit-matrices, from the matrix of any given set of such solutions. -Art. 7. If 1call and 11blj represent two complete sets of independent solutions of the same system, the determinants of fa)) and jibj) are evidently connected by the relation j3 x la-) a x M), a and 13 denoting the greatest divisors of 1j1a and ))b)) respectively. A similar relation subsists between the matrix of the system and the matrix of any complete set of independent solutions of it. Let J1A11 and Hall i'epresent those matrices respectively, K and k their greatest divisors; INDETERMINATE EQUATIONS AND CONGRUENCES. 301 the relation in question is expressed by the formula k x IAIK x lal, .(25.) where it is to be remembered that the types of the matrices IJAII and 1all are complementary; so that, as has been already observed (see art. 1), there is an ambiguity of sign in the equation (25.). To obtain its demonstration, let Q and q denote the sums of the squares of the determinants of 1IAI and 11all respectively, and consider the determinant A* This determinant is certainly not zero, for multiplying it by itself, we find a=Qx. (26.) a A Let, then, be multiplied by any determinant of llAII; for example, by ?+A,1, A22, ..n.,Z Observing that 1+A1, , A2, 25 A. An may assume the form A1,l , A2, , . ..

(27.) in which we may permute the second set of indices in any manner consistent with the condition that should not change its sign; so that we may write A~~~~~~~ a |X IA]I= QXlal,. ........(28.) the correspondence of the determinants in JAI and lal being fixed by the matrix A a The equation (25.) is an immediate consequence of this result; and if in that equation we suppose the correspondence of the determinants to be still fixed by the matrix Al we shall have to write kx Aj= Kxlal, or kxlAl=-KxjaI, JA. according as is a pDositive or negyative number. 01'~~ MDCCCLI. 2 T 302 MR. H. J. S. SMITH ON SYSTEMS OF LINEAR Art. 8. From the preceding principles we may deduce the solution of the following problem, which admits of important applications in other parts of arithmetic: "To find all "the matrices of a given type, of which the determinants have given values, not all equal to zero." Two particular cases of this problem (those in which the matrix is of the type 2 x 3 and 2 x 4) occur in the 'I Disquisitiones Arithmeticee' (see arts. 279 and 236). In both places GAUSS has suppressed the analysis of the problem, and has only given a synthetical demonstration that its conditions are satisfied by the solution he assigns. This, indeed, in art. 279, he expressly observes. He has also suppressed his method of deducing the complete solution -from any particular solution,-an omission, however, which may probably be supplied by a comparison of art. 234 with art. 213, i. The very general and most important case, of a matrix of the type n x (n+ 1), has been subsequently treated of by M. HERMITE A. Let l1xii denote a matrix of the type n X (n+m), of which the constituents are absolutely indeterminate quantities; writing X for IT (n ) we shall represent its determninants by X,, X2, .... X . If qn > 1, these determinants are not all independent, but are connected by certain identities of the form -D(X, X2, .... ) = 0. (2 9.) (P denoting a rational and integral homogeneous function with numerical coefficients. If, therefore, 0,, 02, ... CQ be a given set of integral numbers, which can be represented as the determinants of a matrix of the type n X (n+m), these numbers will satisfy every relation of the form (29.); so that the identity (D(X1, X2) ...X will involve also the numerical equation (C02 C2.. CX)=O. (30.) To obtain a convenient notation for CQ, 2, .. C., let us imagine that we have formed a square matrix of the type (n +m) X (na+ n) by the addition of m? horizontal rows to the matrix loll; if, in the development of the determinant of this matrix, the coefficient of Xi be the determinant r= 12, 3, ...M Xn+r, Lji s=1, 2, 3, ... m (Pi ,. .. {pym denoting m of the numbers 1, 2, ... n+rn), we may represent Xi and Ci by the symbols j4ep,,2, .p . . t4m1 and (pn 2), ... Km,) respectively; observing, however, that if two of the numbers f,, ... are equal, the value zero is to be attributed to each of these symbols. If r denote one of the numbers 1, 2, 3,.. . n, the determinants of the matrix obtained* CRE LLE'S Journal, vol. xl. p. 264; see also E1sIENSTEIN, ibid. vol. xxviii. p. 327.

This system, which is in appearance redundant (containing X X j equations, and ,only m+n indeterminates), is in reality defective, and is equivalent to m independent equations. For if (kl, k2 ... kill) be one of the given numbers C which is not equal to zero, the partial system of rn equations 2-S+(?> k11 k2l kj-11 kj2+11. km)yi= ? 0 3 j=1,2, 3,... m is certainly an independent system, because the determinant of the coefficients of Yk1' Yilk2, * Ykm is (kl, k2, ... km)tm, and is therefore different from zero. Again, every equation of (32.) which is not already comprised in (33.), may be obtained by linearly combining the equations of that partial system. To verify this assertion let r-1 2 3,-.. f.. (34.) be the system of n equations obtained by attributing to r the n values of which it is susceptible in any one of the equations (31.). Eliminating from this system those n-i determinants [i, ) . ] in which i has a value not included in a set of rn+1 numbers Pi, Y2, ... Ym+li arbitrarily selected from the series 1, 2, 3, ... n+n, we obtain a relation, which may be expressed in the form z_1 (=M (1, ("2, * 'rn-i] X [el f 0 * 1 Vial) * )rn+I]0 X * * (35.) representing (m + 1) (n 1) equations, since the sets Pall P2).IJm-1 JVI ) Y2 I -I * m+ 1 may respectively denote any sets of rn-1 and m+1 numbers taken from the series 1, 2, ...

Thus, if we multiply the equations of that system taken in 2 T2 304 MIR. H. J. S.

The system (32.) is therefore equivalent to a system of m independent equations. Let mIX (m+n) represent the matrix of (33.), or of any other independent system equivalent to (32.) (the determinants of all such matrices are proportional); let El 21 ... ra be the determinants of 11?1j; 1'fij and1' 2 *2 r. . h the matrix and determinants of the system similarly derived from (31.).

But if L<X (n4+n); represent a system of fundamental solutions of (32.) or (33.), we have also |X vyT'2X .. . (39.) whence, combining (38.) and (39.), and representing the greatest common divisor of C1, C2, ... CA by c, we find cXj01=jCj. (40.) If, then, 1ell denote any square matrix of determinant c, and of the type n X n, the formula fck! x 11011 contains the complete solution of the problem. If y represent the greatest divisor of 11ry1, we infer from (38.) CXlyrl=yX1C1 .(41.) whence, if 1r'i1 be a prime matrix of the type m X (mn+n) satisfying the equation |fr y r |xy'j (see art. 3), we find Cf X fy'j..(42.) The preceding analysis enables us therefore to obtain simultaneously the representation of the determinants JC! as the determinants of two complementary matrices. of the types n x (mn+n) and mx (m+n) respectively. We have thus two distinct methods of arriving at the solution of the problem, of which one requires the determination of a set of fundamental solutions of a system of linear equations; the other the reduction (by the method of art. 3) of a given matrix to a prime matrix. The greatest divisor of !r! INDETE IINATE EQUATIONS AND CONGRUENCES. 305 which we have represented by r, is evidently (k1, ku,. , it )mn-x c.

Another problem, closely connected with the preceding, and of no less frequent application, has also been completely solved by M.

The preceding problem is a particular case of the following more general enunciation:"Given a prime matrix JJCIJ of the type n?

A particular solution of the problem (which may be taken for 1|Y1I) can be obtained as follows :--Complete the matrix ||CjI by any n horizontal rows of constituents which do not cause the determinant of the resulting matrix to vanish.

( Whenever, therefore, the proposed system is resoluble, its complete solution involves mn indeterminates; but in order that it should be resoluble, a certain condition must be satisfied by its coefficients. This condition is, "that the greatest divisors of its augmented and unaugmented matrices must be equal *." We shall call these divisors D and Do respectively, representing the matrices themselves by JJAJJ and I1AO, . That the condition is necessary may be seen by eliminating in turn every combination of n-1 indeterminates from (56). We thus find that every determinant of 11AII is divisible by DR, i. e. that D is divisible by Do; but evidently D divides D0, so that Dof=D. To show that the condition is sufficient, as well as necessary, consider the system Ai, 0 o+Ai, I x +Aj, 2 X2+.. +Ai, n+n ,xf+rO= } (59) i= 19 2 39 . .. 1t and let 1(m+ 1) X (n+m+1) represent a set of its fundamental solutions. To say that (56.) is resoluble, is the same thing as to say that (59.) admits of solutions in which the value of x. is unity; and (59.) will not, or will admit of such solutions according as $1, 09 032, 01 do, or do not admit of any common divisor beside unity. But, by the theorem of art. 7, those determinants of k0il into which the column 0 , 020 . . . enters, are equal to the determinants of IAoll, taken in a proper order and divided by D. If I)=D0, the determinants of IIA01, divided by D, are relatively prime, and consequently those determinants of 11011 which contain 01, O, 02,0 ... Om, O are also relatively prime; a conclusion which implies that 01,0, 02,0 .. . ,,O are themselves relatively prime, i. e. that the system (56.) is resoluble. This criterion is not immediately applicable if the system (56.) be not independent, i. e. if the determinants of its augmented matrix JJAJJ be all equal to zero. But it may* [This Theorem has already been given by M. IGNAz HEGER (Memoirs of the Vienna Academy, vol. xiv. second part, p. 111). I regret that in the abstract of the present paper, which has been inserted in the 'Proceedings of the Royal Society,' no reference was made to M. HEGER'S Memoir, with the contents of which I was unacquainted, at the time at which that abstract was prepared. M. iHEGER's demonstration (adapted to the terminology here employed) is, in the main, as follows. (1) If the unaugmented matrix of an indeterminate system be prime, the system is always resoluble. For every determinate system, of which the matrix is a unit-matrix, is resoluble in integral numbers; and we may suppose the given indeterminate system to form part of such a determinate system (see art. 10, supre). (2) The equation IJA1f =ffIDf x IA'I1, in which IIDII is a square matrix, having D for its determinant, and IIA'II a prime matrix of the same type as IA II, is always resoluble (see art. 3). We can therefore replace the given system (56.) by a system of which the augmented matrix is IIA'II, and which is resoluble or irresoluble at the same time with the given system. But if Do=D, the unaugmented matrix of this derived system is prime; i. e. if DO=D, the proposed system is resoluble. (3) That the condition is necessary as well as sufficient may be proved as in the text.-Sept. 1861, H. J. S.

If we represent by Dk the greatest divisor of the matrix, deduced from the matrix of (59.) by omitting from it the column A, ,, A2, , ... AX, k, we may enunciate the following proposition: Dk "In every solution of the system (59.), the value of xk is divisible by D; and, conversely, a solution of that system can always be assigned in which xr shall have any given value divisible by It will be seen that the solution of (56.) depends, first, on the solution of (59.), and, secondly, on that of the indeterminate equation 0 0x1+02,0X2+. .. +0m+1, 0 +1-1. (60.) If we represent the values of the indeterminates in this equation as the determinants of the matrix i=1, 2, 3, ... mn j-l 21 ... m+1 (see art. 10), we may express the most general values of the indeterminates which satisfy (56.) in the determinantal form z1g, k 02, k m+1, k k= r1, 1 +(XJI 0i, 0i 71,2 +Pi, 02,0. * + * r +1l, n 01 +F4 oall 72, 1 +P2 01,O, 72, 2 +(P2 02,0 . *1 Y ,n+I +(h2 Om+l, 0 (61.) ym, + +Pkm 01, O r/m, 2 +([h 02, 0 .* m, m +i4 m Om+1, o Art. 12. We shall now indicate an important transformation of which any square matrix of integral numbers is susceptible. We begin with the following theorem "If a given rectangular matrix be premultiplied by a unit matrix, the greatest common divisor of any vertical column of minor determinants is the same in the resulting as in the given matrix." For it is evident that any minor, either in the given or in the resulting matrix, is an integral and linear function of the minors formed from the same vertical columns in the other matrix. Similarly, it may be shown that "When a square matrix is post-multiplied by any prime rectangular matrix, the greatest common divisor of any horizontal row of minors is the same in the resulting rectangular matrix as in the given square matrix." For if n x (n+m) X In X n(n+m)' A B X c i2 3 12 MR. R. J. S. SMITH ON SYSTEMS OF LINEAR where jqCjJ is a prime matrix, it is clear that every minor of IlAll is a linear function of the minors formed from the same horizontal rows of IBIj; so that if a and b be the greatest common divisors of any corresponding horizontal rows of minors in those two matrices, aIt is divisible by b. But again, if 0 be any one of the determinants of fICIj, and s be the order of the minors under consideration, any minor of JIB J, after multiplication by 0S, may be expressed as 'a linear function of a certain group of the minors taken from the same horizontal rows of jjA]. Consequently OS x b is divisible by a; or, since 0 may have any one of a series of values which are relatively prime, b is divisible by a, i. e. b=a. By combining these results we obtain the theorem. "If vv. vn-l vn-2, *. v1 represent the greatest common divisors of all the minors of order n, n-1, ... 1, respectively which can be formed out of a given square matrix, these numbers will remain unchanged, when the given matrix is premultiplied by any unitmatrix, and post-multiplied by any prime matrix whatsoever." Art. 13. Let 0, the determinant of the square matrix |nx be a positive number, a different from zero. It may be shown that by post -multiplication with a properly assumed unit all, the matrix al]l can be reduced to the form pi)1 rl, 2, rl,,3 *)), rl 0 v 2r2, r2, n 0,0 /3 *.r2 3, * ..

This was first observed by GAuss for the case n= 2; by SEEBER for n= 3; and the general theorem has been enunciated by M. HERMITE*. Its precise statement is "1 Every matrix of the type n X n is equivalent (by post-multiplication) to one, and only one, of the reduced matrices included in the formula (62.)." To show this, let vll, 1, l),... v,1 be the integral and relatively prime numbers which satisfy the equations ai,, I~vI, I + (I, v2 l2 + 6.. i, ,r Vn,, I }(6 i-253~ __ n f(64.) and the inequality Gal, 1 v,, I+ +a', 2v V2, 1I+ * *.*.a,, nw n, I > ?Then it is evident that, if lvil be a unit-matrix of which V ,, v21 l ...

To prove that all is equivalent (by post-multiplication) to only one of the reduced matrices (62.), it is sufficient to show that no two reduced matrices can be equivalent. If 11all and 11a'11 be two reduced matrices, and jjvjj a unit-matrix, such that Iall X jjvj =jja11j, it may be inferred, by comparing the corresponding constituents of the two matrices Hall x tjvjj and all (beginning with the lowest horizontal rows of each and proceeding upwards), that all the constituents of 1vril which lie below its principal diameter are zero; and consequently that the constituents of the principal diameter itself are all positive units. Further, that the constituents above the principal diameter of jlv'j are likewise zero, may be established (for each line of constituents parallel to the diameter, beginning with that nearest to it) by means of the inequalities (63.) which are satisfied by the constituents both of Half and 1latjl. It thus appears that two reduced matrices cannot be equivalent, without being identical. It will be observed that the reducing unit is unique; 314 MR. II. J. S. SMITH ON SYSTEMS OF LINEAR i. e. that only one post-multiplying unit can be assigned by which a given matrix can be reduced to the form (62.); If instead of reducing the given matrix jall by post-multiplication we employ a premultiplying unit, we obtain the following theorem: "1 Every matrix of the type n X n and of determinant d is equivalent (by pre-multiplication) to one, and only one of the matrices included in \the formula (62.), in which {Jil' (2*.. are positive, PI ,?* . P ,=, and ri, k satisfies the inequality 0 tskp (66.) Art. 14*. The transformation to which we have referred in art. 12 is obtained by employing simultaneously a pre-multiplying and a post-multiplying unit-matrix. It is expressed by the equation -falll = V , V-1n-xI x o 3, . . . . . . (67.) in which tall is a given square matrix of the type n X n, fcajJ and lli3p are unit-matrices, and v7) Vn-1 vn-2A V,. VO, are the determinant and greatest common divisors of the minor determinants of tall, so that, in particular, V is the determinant of talt, v, -1 the greatest common divisor of its minor determinants of order n1, v1 the greatest common divisor of its constituents, and v0=l. The units 1}aJl and 11t11 are not absolutely determined, but admit, when n>1, of an infinite number of different values. if n=1, it is evident that the formula (67.) is verified; for we have the identical equation 11a 1=1 x|1 X V]Ix 1111. It is therefore sufficient to show that, if the transformation Vo indicated in the formula can be effected for matrices of the type (n-1)x(n-i), it can also be effected for matrices of the type n X n. The demonstration depends on an elementary principle, which it is worth while to enunciate separately.

Let p, q, r ... be the different prime divisors of M; one at least of the constituents of {tAll, for example Ai,j, is prime to p. Attributing to xa a value prime to p, and values divisible byp to the remaining indeterminates, we shall obtain for Uj a value which is certainly prime to p. Similarly, by subjecting the indeterminates to proper congruential conditions with respect to the modules q, r, . .w, we can render one, at least, of the functions U prime to q, one prime to r, and* [This article has been in great part rewritten since the paper was read. The demonstration is not essentially changed, but is presented in what seems to be a simpler form.-Sept. 1861, IL J. S.

Cne, are divisible by D,,. Let O X cX lD, be the greatest common divisor of these last determinants; then 4 x C X Dn_ is divisible by D,, t. e. d is divisible by Dr,,.

To show still more clearly the nature of the quotients ML we add the following proposition: "If in any rectangular matrix we divide each minor determinant of order s by the greatest common divisor of its own first minors, the greatest common divisor of all the quotients thus obtained is VS . By this proposition Vs is itself defined as a greatest common divisor, instead of being defined as the quotient of one greatest common divisor, divided by another. To establish its truth we may first consider the quotient Vv in any rectangular Vn1matrix J1A1j of the type n X(m+n). Let X denote the greatest common divisor of the quotients obtained by dividing each determinant of JJAJJ by the greatest common divisor of the first minors of that determinant: we have then to show that Vii Since the greatest common divisor of any vertical column of minors in JAJJ is not altered by premultiplication with a, unit-matrix, it is evident that rv as well as will remain unchanged by that operation.

Let ?i denote the greatest common divisor of these quotients; then, as we have just seen, X? is the greatest common divisor of all the determinants of the partial matrix, divided by the greatest common divisor of all its first minors. Hence (by art. 12) Xi will remain unchanged when the given matrix is premultiplied by a unit-matrix. But fs is the greatest common divisor of all the divisors XI, i2 ... corresponding to every group of s vertical columns; therefore fl is itself unchanged by premultiplication.

But as this extension of the preceding result is not needed in what follows, we may omit it here. We may add, that the theorem of this article is precisely equivalent to the following, which may be demonstrated by a different method. " If P I be the highest power of a given prime that divides all the minors of order s in a given matrix, and if all the minors of order s-i contained in one particular minor of order s are divisible by p's-" , that minor is itself divisible by p"s .X It should be observed that whenever all the minors of any determinant are zero, the quotient obtained by dividing the determinant by the greatest common divisor of its minors is also zero.

But this method of solving a system of linear congruences, though very symmetrical, is perhaps too tedious for the purposes of computation. INDETERMINATE EQUATIONS AND CONGRUENCES. 323 Art. 18*.

It is easily seen that the condition of resolubility of the system (89.) is, as before, z=d. But the number of its incongruous solutions, when that condition is satisfied, is not B, but Z X Mm. For we have seen that we can find a unit-matrix 1la, and a prime matrix jAIjj of the type n x (n+rn), satisfying the equation ox =V -, V Vn2,V 'VI we may therefore replace the system (89.) by a system of the form V UjCj, mod.

We thus obtain, as a first condition for the resolubility of the proposed system (92.), the congruence D--O. mod. M. (96.) When this condition is satisfied, we obtain from (93.), omitting the term p'n+1 (because I+ ?

When these two conditions are simultaneously satisfied, the number of incongruous solutions is t. For, if we again consider the proposed system of congruences with respect to the modulus p0, and select from it a partial system of n congruences such that the determinants of its augmented matrix, which are necessarily divisible by pin, are not divisible by any higher power of p, it is readily seen that every set of values of the indeterminates xw, x2, . .. xS, which satisfies the partial system, will also (by virtue of the inequality O<I+l II") satisfy the remaining congruences of the proposed system. The number of solutions of the proposed system is therefore the same as that of the partial system. And because pIn the highest power of p which divides every determinant of order n in the augmented matrix of the proposed system is also the highest power of p which divides the augmented matrix of the partial system, it follows from the last theorem of art. 16, that pln-l, pIn-2, . are the highest powers of p which divide the corresponding orders of determinants in the latter, as well as in the former matrix. The number of solutions of the partial system (and consequently of the proposed system), considered with respect to the modulus p', is therefore expressed by the formula [pIn, pInn-i+o.

We shall terminate this paper with an elementary theorem relating to linear systems of equations, which admits of frequent application in other parts of the theory of numbers. Resuming the notation of art. 11, we may see from the theorem of that article, that if the system (56.) be resoluble for any given values of the numbers A, 0, A2, 0, ... An, 01 it is also resoluble for any other values of those numbers, respectively congruous, for the modulus D, to the given values; so that the resolubility or irresolubility of the system depends exclusively on the residues of the numbers Ai,0, mod. D. There are D4 possible combinations of these residues, and we shall now show that for D"1 of them the system is resoluble, while for the remaining DI (D 1) it isirresoluble. For this purpose let "1llx||A"-=1 D' D @1 Dix.

The methods employed in the present paper are without exception such as to be immediately applicable to any species of complex numbers which admit of resolution into actual or ideal prime factors. And the greater part of the results at which we have arrived may be transferred, mutatis mutandis, to the theories of such numbers. For example, if in the equations (56.) we suppose the constituents of JJAJJ to represent complex numbers, it will be found that the criterion for the resolubility or irresolubility of the system, which we have demonstrated in the case of ordinary integers, applies equally in the case of complex numbers; and again, the condition of resolubility of a system of congruences of which the modulus as well as the coefficients are complex numbers, is MDcccTxl.2X 326 ON SYSTEMS OF LINEAR INDETERMINATE EQUATIONS AND CONGRUENCES. precisely the same as in the case of common whole numbers; while the expression for the number of the solutions (when the condition of resolubility is satisfied) is simply the norm of m. But without entering into the developments which this extension of the subject of this paper would require, we shall confine ourselves to an application of the result of the last article to a demonstration of the fundamental principle in the arithmetical theory of complex numbers, that the number of incongruous residues for any complex modulus is represented-by the norm of the modulus. Let ar be one of the roots a, 2... m, of the equation Fn(x)=0,'which is supposed to be 'of n dimensions, to be irreducible and to have all its coefficients integral, and that of its first term unity; 'Let also 05f1(aC) be the complex modulus under consideration; its norm, which we shall symbolize by N, is defined by the equation N=N. 5 Consider the N27,, residues (incongruous mod. N) which are included in the formula R2ff-2(oM).* * . . . . v * * * (99.) where R2,2 denotes ant integer function of 2n-2 dimensions; it is evident that every complex number is congruous, for the modulus to one at least of these N2fl residues. If R-1 and R' be any two (the same or different) of the same residues, it is also plain that the congruence R _R', mod. pn-1(0) will, or will not, be satisfied, according as it is, or is not, possible to assign two functions of x, F, (x) and p#2(x) having integer coefficients, and satisfying the equation Fn$9-()A f ()5-l$ =RB(x).-R'(x). ...*(:100. ) This' equation is equivalent to a system of 2n-. I linear equations, in which the unknown quantities are the 2n-1 coefficients of 5n2(x) and F.-l(x), and of which the determinant is the dialytic resultant of Fn(x) and X 1(x),i. e. the norm of 9l(cc) or N. If then we suppose R(a) to represent any given residue included in the formula (99.), it will appear from the theorem of the last article that the equation (100.) is resoluble for N2'n-2 different values of R'(x), i. e. that every complex number is congruous, for the modulus ,(nl(a), to precisely N2-2 of the N2" residues contained in the formula (99.), or that the number of residues, incongruous mod. 0c(a), is precisely N. Tt is, however, proper to observe, that a complete demonstration of this important theorem has already been given by Professor SYLVESTER (see a paper signed " Lanavicensis," in the I Quarterly Journal of Pure and Applied Mathematics,' vol. iv. p. 94 and-124).3
