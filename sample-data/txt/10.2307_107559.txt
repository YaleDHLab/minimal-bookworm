214 j XVII. A Sketch of an Analysis and Notation applicable to the estimation of the value of Life Contingencies. By BENJAMIN GOMPERTZ, Esq. F. R. S. Read June 9, 1820. THE estimation of the value of property, connected with life contingencies, has for many years occupied the attention of the philosophers, as well as the monied and landed interest of this country. The many institutions now existing in England, for the purpose of granting annuities and assurances on lives, are afsuficient evidence that they are conceived to yield advantages to the community :-advantages which seem to present themselves in two points of view; the one, the gain accruing to the parties granting the assurance or other object; the other, the benefit to be received by persons purchasing those grants. In a political point of viewjit appears a question of great importance to decide, what ought to be the demands of those companies, so that the public may reap the greatest benefit from them? And the only means of answering this question, is the possession of the mathematical and philosophical principles, by which those institutions ought to be guided. In the present improved state of the science of life assurances, it is not sufficient for a proper regulation to follow old customs, and calculations, drawn from a less perfect experience than we have now the means of obtaining; but every company, to reap the advantage of the progressive state of the science, should not only possess Ma. GOMPrRTZ~ a aalys 's, & c. A15 ,ever r mx riedge relative to this science, which it may be within its immediate power to acquire, but it should promub gate its individual information; that the actuaries of the different societies may, by their mathematical skill, collect for the common good of Iall from. multiplied resources that which they cannot obtain from a less general observation. I am induced to venture this hint, as it is my firm belief, that the tables generally adopted, might, by this means receive many extremely necessary corrections for those tables should be as accurate as they can possibly be made, and the interest should be calculated at that rate which shall appear to be the average interest to be made for money ; but such additional demands should be made by the company or institution, as to leave an adequate portion for its security, profit, and expenses; for it! does not seem possible, in the various beneficial applications which can be made from a proper knowledge of this branch of the mathematics, to judge universally how to adopt tables of mortality, which are not correct in themselves, connected with a rate of interest which is not the. average rate made in reality, so that the advantage may tend to any one direction. In granting assurances on lives, it is a practice to use a certain table of mortality, and to calculate at a certain rate of interest, without making any additional charge; in the presumption, that the tables are in themselves incorrect, but that their deviation from the truth, is in favour of the society; and that the interest of money is less than that which they can really make lbut such a plan does not appear to me sufficiently scientific, to be followed by companies concerned with life contingencies generally. It is not my intention in the paper I have at present the honour 2i6 Mr. GOMPERTZ'S analysis applicable to the to present to this profoundly learned Society, to offer my opinion on the rates of mortality ; but my object is to propose a plan of analysis and notation, which I conceive may be applied with utility to most problems likely to occur, and capable of suggesting a variety of new speculations in the pursuit of this science. Many accurate and ingenious men have occupied their hours in the 'improvement of this subject. Messrs. MORGAN, BAILY, and MILNE, of the present age, are among the number of mathematicians to whom this department is greatly indebted; the works of the former two gentlemen have been long before the public; that of Mr. MILNE, was not earlier than about the commencement of this year in my possession; but I felt much gratified with the able manner in' which he has treated his different subjects ; and pare ticularly pleased with his notation, in his sixth chapter, referring to the different orders of survivorship. I feel thankful for the information I have received from the labours of those who have preceded me ; and I hope that this sketch may be received as a wish to aid science, but not as a medium to censurethose whose steps may sometimes have faltered in the paths to knowledge. TO a true philosopher, it will ever be much more pleasing to grant even more praise than is actually due, than to pluck the laurel from the deserving brow. This is an observation which might frequently be addressed to authors, but I profess no particular point of application in my remark. BENJAMIN GOMPERTZ.

A function, that is an expression made up of certain quantities, has been often very usefully expressed by some letter with those quantities written underneath, of which that function or expression is made up. And frequently those quantities only are placed under, which it may be the particular object to bring into notice; thus, if i' an analysis we had the frequent occurrence of some particular expression, vz2 + x2+/X + y, for instance, it might be cone venient to put some, letter to represent it; and if we had two or more expressions of the same form made up of different letters, such for instance as Va' + x +Vlx+-y, and Va + 1/z + w, it may be more convenient to express them by some generic character, which shall still involve the peculiarity of each; thus, by writing for the one M, y and for the other 3HzWa and this or a similar mode of notation; bee comes more necessary when we' are ignorant of the form of the expressions to which our analysis is to be applied. Art. 2. If for x in the expression Mx signifying somne funcd Soion of xX, we write separately x n, x n +p, x -=n + 2A, x = n + 3p, &c. av increasing by the continual addition of p; then the sum of the terms commencing with x n and fini.shing with x-m, is M?+ ...+ .&c..Mm;andto express this operation on x, I use the symbol i prefixed m to the function of x; that is, I should write P f Mx for this m stup,1 Tl5}is is the saute a s what is called the finite integral of 218 1V2W GOMPERTZ's analysis applicable to the M from xr X=n to x-m; that is, the first value of the incremenlt M+ of theseries being M and tie last Mm +p or which is the same thing, the first term of the series being and the last term of the series M And thus would NTX . . n .T M.+~ express M ++ ne+S qn~+p and also would P+E M MMH++ M"+8+V+ * as is evident by writing n+s and m+e respectively inL -the room of n and m in the first of the series mentioned; conx x P _Pt sequently, M , M ; they both being expressive of the sum of the same series. Moreover, because when x becomes n, x+e becomes n+e, and when x becomes m, x+s becomes mn + e; therefore the symbols P j and P when prefixed to the same function mean the same thing, that is P I -P ml X M+Sl X Also because n j M is the symbol for M,, p + Mn + p + &c. Mm+p, and n / MX is the symbol for M.+ M ^+p x M X+p+ &C:..** Mm therefore n M -f Mn Mm~ est mation of the Value of 1fe conti~ngencies. 1ig X _ n M and also=M + M or n-p MP+ This last is also evident from above. Art. 4a. It may be proper to state that the symbol ' is not necessarily written with the Aetters x, p, n, m; but that with other letters it will; mtation mutandis, have a similar meaning: the first or highest letter within the symbol exp)ressing the constant increment of the variable quantity above the .symbol the second, the value of that variable quantity at the com. mencement ; and the last or lowest letter the valuie thereof at the end. If this letter be infinite, we onlit 'Its iNfation and z write the symbol thus P f If p, or the first letter within be infinitely small, or o comparatively with finites, then the svmbol will stand ni and will express the integral of a differential expression of X between the limits n and m of x, and vill be the same as the fluent of a flu xional expresson between the same limits, mutatis mutandis, Art. A. L4, Lt}b L, &c. are put to denote the number of persons living at the ages a, b, c, &c. in a given table of mortclity, and La a c t is put for an abbreviation of La x Lb x LC, &ct also L b is put for an abbreviati\o'n of L x L -X a,$b,c,&C. a+X, X b-L xLc+; La fs o , S L & * for an abbreviation of L Lb+ xL6+x &c*x LdxL xLf&c.

La,,c,&c. / m1 n : a, bc, &C. and this we would write still shorter when a more developed r expression is not necessary, thus a, b, c, &C. to signify as estimation of the value of lfre contingencies. 221 before. The present value of a periodic income of one pound payable on the joint lives of persons of the present ages a, b, c, &c. at equally distant intervals p, the first payment being due in the time nt, and the last in the time m, the present value of one pound certain due in one year being r. If there be not any character in the place of the r, in the last symbolic form, the interest is supposed to be the same as in some previous consideration, which shall be evident from the text; thus, if we had been conversing of an interest of 5 per cent. per annum, we shouldwrite a, b, c, to express the present value of an annuity of one pound (that is one pound payable yearly) on the joint lives of thel present ages a, b, &c. the first payment to be made in one year, because in this case pz 1, n-i and m is infinite, or extends to the longest possible duration of life. Art. 5. If the income is on the present ages a, b, c, &c. be. tween the terms &c., on the contingency of v or more of them being living, we write as a symbol of its present value p P b, c, &c., and according to this notation we should have in the following particular cases for the present value of the inr r r a,_ bcaabbc hecte n"m come n a bsc, the same as n n|. !?|C, when thei ncorn no 3 on m for the term depends on two or more of the three persons r whose present ages are a, b, c, being living, n | when it m I depends on one or more of the three being living; that is r what is termed on the longest of the lives; and a MDCcCxX. G g e22 Mr. GoMPERTZS analysis applicable to the when it depends on none, or any of them being living, and is therefore the income certain and quite independent of the ages a, b, c, and therefore this case may be written withr out those letters, thus nj 0 ' and will be expressive of the present value of an income certain for the term, &c.; o inserted in the angle signifying that it does not involve any contingency; and this presents us with a ready notation for the purpose of expressing an income for a term, a rate of interest, and a periodic interval of payment given on any nominated continw gency specified by any particular character, by placing that character in the angular point ; thus if the contingency involved were designated by the character C, then the income for the term, rate of interest, &c. depending on that continr gency, we should denote by c _ . r Art. 6. Moreover, as n -expresses the value of the inm 0 r come certain for the term, and Pa, bc,&c. expresses the value of the income for the term on the contingency of v or more of the persons of the present ages a, b, c, &c. being living; the excess of the former above the'latter, will express the value of the income for the term on the contingency of pvY + i, or more of the persons being dead; if V be the number of persons in all: "because it is certain that out of v persons living at any c time, there will after that time either be Y or more of them "living, or v or less of them living including o; but v-X or less of them being livingis the same as p-i+ or more estimation of the -value of/fr contingencies. 23 "of them dead; therefore the chance of v of them being liv"ing + the chance of of them being dead, is equal to unity, that is certainty," and the said excess wvill be writsM r r 1 _ ten l _ as b, c. , and is expressive of the chance of vr mon V m or more being dead, X being equal to -v + i ; or I*, that is the number of persons in all being =-7r+v-; and as the sign r of summation and the interest indicated by r, the present value of one pound certain to be received at the years end, affect both contingencies alike, we may join those contingencies and r use but one symbol, and we shall have n |' a, b, c, &c. for the m 0) V value of the income for the term on the contingency, that out of ir + v1 persons, there shall be X or more of them dead. r r r Accordingly wvould n ~ ,a, b, c K a, b, c, and P , a, b, c rem 0,3 Ma,2 m o, I spectively signify the value of the income for the term on the contingency of one or more being dead, of two or three being dead, or of all being dead. And these besides being an appropriate abbreviation of the expressions, likewise indicate, that if from the value of the income certain for the term we subtract separately the value for the income for the term on the contingency of all three being living, on the contingency of two or more being -living', and on the contingency of one or more being living, of three persons, we shall have respectively the value of the income for the term on the contingency of one or more being dead, two or more being dead, or of all 224 Mr. GOMPERTZ'S analysis applicable to the r being dead of three persons.

If one pound is to be received at the expiration of the first of the equal periods p, after the cxpiration of the time n-oP, which shall happen after the failure 'of any of the above conditions of joint or single existence of the persons in question, provided that that failure should take place between the intervals n-p and m; the present value of this sum will be the present value discounted for the period p of the income on the contingency of the conditions not failing, the. first payment to be made at the period n.'p, and the last at the period m-p, less the present value of the income on the contin gency of the conditions riot failing, the firct paymreut to be made in the time n, and the last in the time m. Thus suppose the incomne, payable at every interval p, of one pound on the contingency of certain lives remaining, the first payment to be made at the time n, and the last at the time m, be reprer sented by and therefore a similar regulated income of which the first payment s to be made in the time n-p, and p the last in the time M-p. will be n and the present value of one pound to be received at the first period p which shall happen after the failure of the condition, &c. is r r r r X , xecause is the value of one mo C X CC pound to be received at the period X in the contingency of the r conditions not having failed, on or before that time; + r is the chance of its not having failed on or before that time; 926 MP ?

These denote the assurances of one pound to be received after the failure takes place; and if they be multiplied by rP, they will denote the value of the assurance, if the money be to be received at the timep after the event takes place, whenever that may happen between the times n and m; and this is properly what should be called the assurance of the sums, though writers call r r what I denote by n, &c. the assurance. See Scholium. Art. io. It is often necessary in calculating from tables, to have a method of interpolation for the discovery of terms not explicitly contained in the tables; if, for instance, wve had the function M X. &c. calculated in a table, for values of xy, z, &c. taken in as, many series proceeding in arithmetical pro"? gression, according to certairi scales of differences and we wish to have the value of the function when some only, or neither of thema are in those series.

If there be any function MX, which decreases as x increases, and for x we write x+n, the function will be transformed into M and may be developed into MAl-n MX +n M+n3 Mi,&c where M is positive; and if ,n be taken sufficiently small we shall have M M -nM' sufficiently near. And nM' will be nearly the X X ,x decrement produced in MX by writing x+n for x. And this aproximati've decrement is proportional to n. Hence it appears, that the number of persons living in any table of mortality indicating the number of persons living at every possible age, that is to any fraction of a year or unity of time, the intervals of age may be taken so small, that whatever the law of mortality mav be, during any portion of any the same interval tie decrernents may be considered proportional to the time. Observation informs use that this proportionality of decrement may be admitted as affording a tolerable degree of accuracy during very long intervals, and in that respect, it gives us some idea of the nature of the function of mortality; but independently of observations from known results, we see that we may approximate to any degree of acc uracy con. taimed in the tables, by dividing long intervals into shorter intervals, and taking, whatever may be the functions of more tality or of living, the decrements proportional to the portions of time between the separate intervals, and thus if we r wished to find the value of ' _ b, c, &c., that is the value of an annuity of one pound on the joint lives whose present ages are a, b, C, &c.; the first payment to be made in the time n, and the last in the time m, at a rate per cent. indicated by the estimation of the value of fe contingences. 31 present worth r of one pound to be received, certain in one r one year; because n7 at b e, &c.

Moreover any functions Mx+m, may be developed Into te form m. im, + in1 M", + &C. -the form M IT ' + &cand, consequently, if n be sufficiently srnall to admit of all powers of n above the first being omitted, we shall have M,+q Mx .mM and if this remark be applied to the function La+n, of the living at the age a+n, we see that we may take an interval m, from n so small, whatever be the real constitution of the function, that the number of the living, during that interval, shall decrease so as to form a geometrical progression very nearly, whilst the portions of tine increase in an arithmetical progression; and that the decrements of living are also in consequence very nearly in geometrical progression: and we may moreover in this, as in the former case, accomu modate the function so as to be accurate at the two extremes. Thus, for instance, if we wish to have an approxinative expression in a geometrical progression, for the number of living for ages from c20 to 3o years, which shall be exact for the age 2o and go, according to the Northampton tables of mortality.

The reason of adducing these two, which are commonly ap'C proximate values of I Lq AX r+x, is that several ingenious authors in the'solution of some of the problems hereafter to be considered have taken as an approximation that if two persons, who were living at a particular period, are both dead at any nominated period after, within a certain limit, that it is an equal chance which of the two is the survivor; which as will appear is the natural consequence of SuppOSillg the decrements of the lives during every part of that period, to be in a constant proportion to the time elapsed from the comestimation of the value of life contingencies. 243 mencement of the period. But the mode of analysis pursued by those gentlemen, have, led them to divide their periods continually into two, the one a period generally of several years, and the other a period of one year only, and they hbve calculated for the two periods separately, aand added the result of the two. This mode would be given from the first of the two forms of this article, which is extremely more coma plex than the second form, and apparently with very little, if any advantage; for if -the decrements were accurately in a constant proportion to the time from the coinmencement, they would be perfectly of equal value; though the one possesses so much more simple a form than the other and when they are each but approximations, there will be but little choice to be made between them, in point of proximity, in the use they are to be made of in those problems; though there will be a vast differenlce in the degree of simplicity in the resulting formula.

And thus we might proceed to an infinite variety of cases with regard to the limits in time, with regard to the number of events, &c.; and however compounded and numerous the signs of fluentization and summation may be. and if this mode of enunciation -be duly considered, it will be found that the meaning of the more compound cases is much easier to express and to understand, in this analytical language, than by a more elaborate phraseology; and that this mode enables us as soon as the meaning of the question is understood, granting the theory of summations andfluentizations, to solve it. No. 7. By way of illustration I shall only add here, that the nature of the events to which K, K', K" &c. may refer, is unlimited ; they may refer to single lives only, to joint lives, to joint lives connected with other joint lives, to joint lives connected with deaths, &c. And that more compounded cases may be understood, I also mention that W2 X p. . ..." (r +P.

Article 6. As it is probable that the reader wvlii be desirous to see the application of our theory to some of the problems which have been esteemed the most difficult, I shall consider the problems which have been solved by Mr. MORGAN, in the Philosophical Transactionss; and in pursuing this object, I shall take the examples il the order in which they have been presented by Mr. BAILY, in his work on Assurances, from page eo6, because that Gentleman's book was in -my hand when I worked the examples. Note, that the object which I denote by p, has with those Gentlemen the particular value one year; and is supposed by them to be wholly within the limits of proportional decrement. Note also, that the present ages of A, B and C, I denote by a, b and c. Example i.

But I observe that a near approximation of its value in this case is one twelfth of the income certain for the term multiplied by the chance of all three dying between the intervals n and n+p; and as an example of pa= n=i, and the corresponding assurance for the whole possible joint existence be required from the Northampton Tables, for three lives at the age of 3o, at the interest of 3 per cent; considering the last income possibly to be received, to be at the age 95, the term will be 65, and the approximative value of this neglected part, if the assurance be on ?iooo. to be paid for in one payment; will be iooo x ZL} 23 12 X 43851 72345 about 240000f one pound, which is less than three pence. If we use Article to, Section A, we shall obtain the same portions of the contingencies as has been used by Messrs. MORGAN and BAILY, whence &c.

As the Tables calculated for the valuation of annuities or yearly incomes may be serviceable for the valuation of iincomes payable at less periods, it will be proper to show how the value of such incomes depend on each other; and also to show how to compare the value of assurances on lives, when the sum assured is to be received at some one of a number of periods which is to'happen after the death, reckoning from a fixed period, with the value of the assurance, if the sum is to be received at a gven distant time fromn the death; for instance, what is commonly called the assurance of Li. on a life, is the value of one pound to be received at the first anniversary from the payment of the premium, which shall happen after the death; but it is not the value of one pound to be received at the death; and it is, as will appear farther on, very nearly the value of one pound to be received a half year after the death shall happen. r r Art. i .

When the term is not very long, especially when there are many lives concerned, it will be often preferable to calculate with the usual tables by calculating each term of the expression P N N+ n*M+pwhen put into the form :in M +N"N 2 2 * M+p + &c. And I think when many lives are concerned, 2 this will generally be the best way, if even the term should be long; but for the sake of preventing great error in such cases, or for near approximation, the following hint may be serviceable. Suppose we wished to calculate the value of A Ar, that is the sum of the first 80 terms of the series whose #,r term is A,?; then since ] AnAIX A -A + MA 8o 7 3 74 751 i A A7,. ..&c.

And if an approximation to the value be sufficient, we may avoid great labour by taking 8 x A, A, or 8 x A, for the value of the sum; 771 78 and if r does not differ much from unity A. rxwillbe nearly 8o =8, S1_ X ``r AX or to 8 6 fr rrAir 77j 78 Art.

In a similar manner may the immediate reduction of analogous triple fluents be shown; and I may remark, that in the double fluents of Section 4, the case of the question may not always require them both to commence with the r same value of x. The application of the symbol 1 to all cases of definite and indefinite fluents, and of sinmle, double &c. fluents, might be entered on perhaps with advantage to other branches of the mathematics; but this is not my prep sent object. Art. 6. If in the room of MS of Art. 4, of this Scholium, we put rM A.

And P (N.N. rn-I 4 +flP . Mp)riteqa *QN p-No r".M M, is the value if it is to be paid immediately after the failure, provided it takes place between the intervals n and m. It is necessary to add, that the method pointed out in Art. 4 of this Scholium, for solving the problems of Section 4, will generally produce results which do not agree to absolute mathematical equality, with the results of that Section, except the intervalp be infinitely small; but they will agree with each other as far as the first power of p is concerned; which when p is taken, the smallest interval of the tables will be as near the truth as any method should be considered to reach, as long as the real function of life is not known; except indeed there be sufficient regularity in the tables to induce the belief that we may approach nearer by interpolation as hinted in Art. 4, Section 3 ; but if the interval p be not greater than one year, this will give, I think, sufficient accuracy for any useful purpose, except perhaps in very rare cases, and in which our tables (from more minute observation), should, I imagine, be divided into less periods than yearly interval, and then the same method would still apply by taking p smaller. The same observation will apply if a comparison is made with what is done in the present Article 6 of this Scholium, with the other articles of the Scholium; for instance, with Article A.

I might make some farther observations on the comparison of the different methods pointed out, with respect to their proximity, but I fear that the length of this Paper has already caused me to occupy too large a portion of the present volume.
