Extract of a Letter from Sir James Gray, Bart. his Majesty's Envoy to the King of Naples, to the Right Honourable Sir Thomas Robinson, Knight of the Bath, one of his Majesty's Secretaries of State, relating to the same Discoveries at Herculaneum. Naples, October 29, 1754. SEveral curious and valuable things are daily found in the mine of antiquities at Portici. They have lately met with more rolls of Papyri of different lengths and sizes, some with the Umbilicus remaining in them; the greater part are Greek in small capitals. The Canonico Mazocchi, who is much esteemed for his learning and knowlege of antiquity, is employed in copying and explaining five intire columns, that have been lately unrolled off one of the Papyri, which gives some hopes of farther discoveries. This manuscript treats of music and poetry. The Epicurean phi5 M losophy [826] losophy is the subject of another fragment, a small bust of Epicurus, with his name in Greek characters, was found in the same room, and was possibly the ornament of that part of the library, where the writings in favour of his principles were kept; and it may also be supposed, that some other heads of philosophers, found in the same room, were placed with the same taste and propriety. Last week were found two fine bronze heads, of excellent workmanship, one of Seneca, and another of a captive king. The king spares no expence in recovering and preserving these valuable remains. In order to satisfy the curiosity of the public, he has ordered a catalogue to be printed, with some designs of the principal statues and paintings, which will be published soon. A more exact account of these discoveries will some time or other be given by Monsignor Baiardi, who, in three large quarto volumes already printed, has not finished his introduction. CIV.
