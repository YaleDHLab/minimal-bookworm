Part of a Letter from Dr. David Gregory, to Dr.Sloane, dated Oxford, October 12. 1699. containing his observations of the Eclipse of the Sun on the 13th of September last. I Send you a Scheme of the Phases of the late Eclipse of the Sun, (see the Table) as I observ'd them. I did not see the beginning of it: But the end happened here, precisely Twenty four Minutes and Nine seconds after Ten a Clock in the Morning, apparent Time, and all the Times marked in the Figure are such: The greatest Observation, which was Ten Digits and a Quarter, was about Seven Minutes after [331] ter Nine. The Scheme shews the rest of the Phases.
