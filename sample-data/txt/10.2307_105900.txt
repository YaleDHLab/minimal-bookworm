[355] XXIX. An Account of an Occultation of the Star ~ Tauri by the Moon, observed at Leicester: By the Rev. Mr. Ludlam, in a Letter to the Rev. Mr. Maskelyne, Astronomer Royal. Reverend SIR, I Here send you an account of the occultation of the star ~ Tauri by the moon, as we saw it at Leicester April 28, 1770. The necessary observations for examining the clock, are subjoined, which I think should always be done by those who have not fixed observatories; or where their instruments are not well adjusted at first, and frequently examined afterwards. Without being thus particular, no one can judge what degree of credit may be afforded to such observations; and it has, besides, this advantage, that if a mistake should be made in the calculations grounded on them, any person versed in Astronomy can rectify it. Read June 4, 1770. I beg the favour of you to communicate this to the Royal Society; and am, With the greatest respect, Their and your most humble servant, Leicester, April 29, 1770. W. Ludlam. Z z 2 The [356] The immersion was noted at IXh 41m 7s by the clock. I think it might be two seconds sooner, because the clock being of necessity at a distance from the telescope, the instant of the immersion was signified by striking upon a bell. The emersion was about Xh 31~ but with some uncertainty, the star being hid by a cloud at its first coming out. By the observed transits of the sun and stars, the clock lost three seconds between the 25th and 28th. On the 25th, by corresponding altitudes, the clock was 1~ 46~, 8 too slow; whence on the 28th it was 1~ 49~, 8 too slow. This confirms the observation made by corresponding altitudes on the 28th, by which it was 1~ 50~ too slow at noon: the clock was then losing at the rate of four seconds a day; whence, on the 28th at IXh, it was 1~ 51~, 5 slower than mean time. The equation of time on the 28th at IXh was 2~ 47~, 5, whence the immersion was at IXh 45~ 44~ apparent time. The Telescope made use of was one of Dollonds, with a triple object glass of 331/3 inches focal distance, and which magnifies 52 times.
