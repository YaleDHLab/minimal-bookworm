XXXIX. An Account of the Observations made on the same Transit in Sweden: In a Letter from Mr. Peter Wargentin, Secretary to the Royal Academy of Sciences in Sweden, and F. R. S. to Mr. John Ellicot, F. R. S. Translated from the French. S I R, Stockholm, Aug. 7, 1761. IN a letter, dated June 8th, I communicated to Dr. Birch, Secretary to the Royal Society, my observations upon the transit of Venus. Having since received some other good observations of this phaenomenon, I thought the communicating them to you, would give you some pleasure. Read Nov 12, 1761. At Torneo in Lapland, Messieurs Lagerborn and Hellant very happily observed both the entrance and exit of Venus, with telescopes of 32 and 20 feet focal lengths. The principal times observed were as follows: Exterior [214] Exterior conInterior conInterior contact at the entact at the entact at the Total exit. trance. trance. exit. h ~ ~ h ~ ~ h ~ ~ h ~ ~ Lagerborn 3 45 44 4 4 1 9 54 22 10 12 18 Hellant 3 45 51 4 3 59 9 54 8 10 12 22 Mr. Hellant is esteemed a very good observer. The difference between the meridians of Paris and Torneo, is computed to be 1h 27~ 28~, very nearly. At Abo, the capital of Finland, situated in latitude 60~ 27~, longitude east of Paris 1h 19~ 17~, Mr. Justander observed with a telescope of 20 feet; h ~ ~ The interior contact, at the entrance to be at 3 55 50 Beginning of the exit, at 9 46 59 Total emersion, at 10 4 42 At Hernosand, a city in Sweden, in latitude 60~ 38~, and longitude 1h 2~ 12~ east of the meridian of Paris, Messieurs Gister and Strom observed, with telescopes of 20 feet. h ~ ~ h ~ ~ h ~ ~ h ~ ~.

This city is 43~ 50~ to the east of the meridian of Paris.

In these observations, I made use of an excellent telescope, of 21 Swedish feet, and Mr. Klingenstierna observed with one of Mr. Dollond's telescopes, of 10 feet, with an eye-glass fitted to it, which magnified the object more than 140 times. In comparing these observations together, you will perceive, that they do not agree so near as was hoped for; and those which were made at Paris, agree but little better. I should be very glad to hear how the English observers have succeeded, both at London, and at St. Helena; I therefore desire you would procure for me those observations, which have been communicated to the Royal Society, to whom you may present [216] present these from Sweden, if you think them deserving your notice, which I hope you will. I have the honour to be, With the most perfect esteem, S I R, Your most obedient humble servant, Wargentin.
