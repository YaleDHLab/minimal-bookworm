[ 415 ] XX. A JMe.noir on Curves of the Third Order. By A. CAYLEY, Espy., F.R.S. Received October 30,-Read December 11, 1856. A CURVE of the third order, or cubic curve, is the locus represented by an equation such as U=(*+x, y, Z)3-0; and it appears by my " Third Memoir on Quantics," that it is proper to consider, in connexion with the curve of the third order U -0 and its Hessian HU =O (which is also a curve of the third order), two curves of the third class, viz. the curves represented by the equations PU=O and QU=O. These equations, I say, represent curves of the third class; in fact, PU and QU are contravariants of U, and therefore, when the variables x, y, z of U are considered as point coordinates, the variables I, a, ; of PU and QU must be considered as line coordinates, and the curves will be curves of the third class. I propose (in analogy with the form of the word Hessian) to call the two curves in question the Pippian and Quippian respectively. A geometrical definition of the Pippian was readily found; the curve is in fact STEINER'S curve RO mentioned in the memoir " Allgemeine Eigenschaften der algebraischen Curven," Crelle, t. xlvii. pp. 1-6, in the particular case of a basis-curve of the third order; and I also found that the Pippian might be considered as occurring implicitly in my "M Memoire sur les Courbes du Troisieme Ordre," Iilouville, t. ix. p. 285, and " Nouvelles Remarques sur les Courbes du Troisieme Ordre," Liouville, t. x. p. 102. As regards the Quippian, I have not succeeded in obtaining a satisfactory geometrical definition; -but the search after it led to a variety of theorems, relating chiefly to the first-mentioned curve, and the results of the investigation are contained in the present memoir. Some of these results are due to Mr. SALMON, with whom I was in correspondence on the subject. The character of the results makes it difficult to develope them in a systematic order; but the results are given in such connexion one with another as I have been able to present them in. Considering the object of the memoir to be the establishment of a distinct geometrical theory of the Pippian, the leading results will be found summed up in the nine different definitions or modes of generation of the Pippian, given in the concluding number. In the course of the memoir I give some further developments relating to the theory in the memoirs in ILiouville above referred to, showing its relation to the Pippian, and the analogy with theorems of TIESSE in relation to the Hessian. Article No. 1.-Definitions, &c. 1. It may be convenient to premise as follows:-Considering, in connexion with a curve of the third order or cubic, a point, we have(a) Thefirst or conic polar of the point. (6) The second or line polar of the point. The meaning of these terms is wpell known, and they require no explanation. 416 MR. A. CAYLEY'S MEMOIR ON CURVES OF TIE THIRD ORDER. Next, considering, in connexion with the cubic, a line(c) The first or conic polars of each point of the line meet in four points, which are the four poles of the line. (d) The second or line polars of each point of the line envelope a conic, which is the lineo-polar envelope of the line. And reciprocally considering, in connexion with a curve of the third class, a line, we have(e) The first or conic pole of the line. (f) The second or point pole of the line. And considering, in connexion with the curve of the third class, a point(g) The first or conic poles of each line through the point touch four lines, which are the four polars of the point. (h) The second or point poles of each line through the point generate a conic, which is the point pole locus of the point. But I shall not have occasion in the present memoir to speak of these reciprocal figures, except indeed the first or conic pole of the line. The term conjugate poles of a cubic is used to denote two points, such that the first or conic polar of either of them, with respect to the cubic, is a pair of lines passing through the other of them. Reciprocally, the term conjugate polars of a curve of the third class denotes two lines, such that the first or conic pole of either of them, with respect to the curve of the third class, is a pair of points lying in the other of them. The expression, a syzygetic cubic, used in reference to two cubics, denotes a curve of the third order passing through the points of intersection of the two cubics; but in the present memoir the expression is in general used in reference to a single cubic, to denote a curve of the third order passing through the points of intersection of the cubic and its Hessian. As regards curves of the third class, I use in the memoir the full expression, at curve of the third class syzygetically connected with two given curves of the third class. It is a xvell-known theorem, that if at the. points of intersection of a given line with a ,iven cubic tangents are drawn to the cubic, these tangents again meet the cubic in three points which lie in a line; such line is in the present memoir termed the satellite line of the given line, and the point of intersection of the two lines is termed the satellite p0oint of the given line; the given line in reference to its satellite line or point is termed the primary line. In particular, if the primary line be a tangent of the cubic, the satellite line coincides with the primary line, and the satellite point is the point of simple intersection of the primary line and the cubic. Article No. 2.-Group of Theorems relating to the Conjugate Poles of a Cubic. 2. The theorems which I have first to mention relate to or originate out of the theory of the conjugate poles of a cubic, and, may be conveniently connected together and explained by means of the accompanying figure. MR. A. CAYLEY'S MEMOIR ON CURVES OF THE THIRD ORDER. 417 The point E is a point of the Hessian; this being so, its first or conic polar, with respect to the cubic, will be a pair of lines passing through a point F of the Hessian; and not only so, but the first or conic polar of the point F, with respect to the cubic willbe a pair of lines passing through E. The pair of lines through F are represented in the figure by FBA, FDC, and the pair of lines through E are represented by ECA, EDC, and the lines of the one pair meet the lines of the other pair in the points A, B, C, D. The point 0, which is the intersection of the lines AD, BC, is a point of the Hessian, and joining EO, FO, these lines are tangents to the Hessian at the points E, F, that is, the points E, F are corresponding points of the Hessian, in the sense that the tangents to the Hessian at these pointsp C/ el/ D e: B ;; 0 s ; F A Ofmeet in a point of the Hessian. The two points E, F are, according to a preceding definition, conjugate poles of the cubic. The line EF meets the Hessian in a third point G, and the points G, 0 are conjugate poles of the cubic. The first or conic polar of G, with respect to the cubic, is the pair of lines AOD, BOC meeting in 0. The first or conic polar of 0, with respect to the cubic, is the pair of lines GEF and Gf'efe' meeting in G. The four poles of the line EO, with respect to the cubic, are the points of intersection of the first or conic polars of the two points E and 0, that is, the four poles in question are the points F, F, e, 6'. Similarly, the four poles of the line FO, with respect to the cubic, are the points E, E, J;f'. The line EF, that is, any line joining two conjugate poles of the cubic, is a tangent to the Pippian, and the point of contact F is the harmonic with respect to the points E, F (which are points on the Hessian) of G, the third point of intersection with the Hessian. Conversely, any tangent of the Pippian meets the Hessian in three points, two of which are conjugate poles of the cubic, and the point of contact is the harmonic, with respect to these two points, of the third point of intersection with the Hessian. The line GO in the figure is of course also a tangent of the Pippian, and moreover the lines FBA, FDC (that is, the pair of lines which are the first or conic polar of E) and the lines ECA, EDB (that is, the pair of lines which are the first or conic polar of F) are also tangents to the Pippian. The point E represents arty point of the Hessian, and the three tangents through E to the Pippian are the line EFG and the lines ECA, EDB; the line EFG is the line joining E with the conjugate pole F, and the lines ECA, EDB are the first or conic polar of this conjugate pole F with respect to the cubic. The figure shows that the line EO (the tangent to the Hessian at the point E) and the beforementioned three lines (the tangents through E to the Pippian), are harmonically related, viz. the line EO the tangent of the Hessian, and the line EF one of the tangents to the Pippian, are harmonics with respect to the other two tangents to the Pippian. It is MDCCCLVII. 3 i 418 MR. A. CAYLEY'S MEMOIR ON CIJRVES OF TUE THIRD ORDER. obvious that the tangents to the Pippian through the point F are in like manner the line GFE, and the pair of lines FBA, FBC, and that these lines are harmonically related to FO the tangent at F of the Hessian. And similarly, the tangents to the Pippian through the point 0 are the line GO and the lines AOD, BOC, and the tangents to the Pippian through the point G are the line GO and the lines GFE and Gf'efe'. Thus all the lines of the figure are tangents to the Pippian except the lines EO, FO, which are tangents to the Hessian. It may be added, that the lineo-polar envelope of the line EF with respect to the cubic is the pair of lines OE, OF. It will be presently seen that the analytical theory leads to the consideration of a line IJ (not represented in the figure): the line in question is the polar of E (or F) with respect to the conic which is the first or conic polar of F (or E) with respect to any syzygetic cubic. The line IJ is a tangent of the Pippian, and moreover the lines EF and IJ are conjugate polars of a curve of the third class syzygetically connected with the Pippian and Quippian, and which is moreover such that its Hessian is the Pippian. Article Nos. 3 to 19.-Analytical investigations, comprising the proof of the Theorems, Article No. 2. 3. The analytical theory possesses considerable interest. Take as the equation of the cubic, U=x 3+y3+z3+6xyz= 0. Then the equation of the Hessian is HU=12(X3+y3+z3)(1+213)xyz -; and the equation of the Pippian in line coordinates (that is, the equation which expresses that {x+ny+4z=O is a tangent of the curve) is PU = (3 +43 +(-3 1 +41`)En-= 0. The equation of the Quippian in line coordinates is QU= (1_1013 XEf3 +n3 + 3) -612(5+413)E4t= 0 and the values of the two invariants of the cubic form are T=1 2013_816, values which give identically, T2-.64S3=(1 + 813)3; the last-mentioned function being in fact the discriminant. 4. Suppose now that (X, Y, Z) are the coordinates of the point E, and (X', Y', Z') the coordinates of the point F; then the equations which express that these points are conjugate poles of the cubic, are XX'+l(YZ' +Y'Z) =0, YY' +l(ZX' +Z'X) = 0, ZZ' +l(XY'+X'Y)=0; MR. A. CAYLEY'S MEMOIR ON CURVES OF THE THIRD ORDER. 419 and by eliminating from these equations, first (X', Y', Z'), and then (X, Y, Z), we find + 12(X3 +Y3 +Z3) (1 + 213)X Y Z = 0, + 12(X'3+Y/3+ Z'3)-(1 + 213)X'Y'Z'=-0, which shows that the points E, F are each of them points of the Hessian. 5. I may notice, in passing, that the preceding equations give rise to a somewhat singular unsymmetrical quadratic transformation of a cubic form. In fact, the second and third equations give X': Y': Z' =YZ 12X2: 12XY _Z2: 12ZX _Y2. And substituting these values for X', Y', Z' in the form + 12(X'3 +Y'3 + Z/3)-(1 + 213)X'Y'Z', the result must contain as a factor +12(X3+Y3+Z3) (1+213)XYZ; the other factor is easily found to be _13 13 (X3 +Y3 +Z3) + 3 JXYZ) Several of the formula given in the sequel conduct in like manner to unsymmetrical transformations of a cubic form. 6. I remark also, that the last-mentioned system of equations gives, symmetrically, Xl2: Y2: Zl2: YIZI ZIXI: X1YI =YZ12X2: ZX . 12Y2: XY_12Z2: 12YZ -X2: l2ZX _Y2: l2XY _Z2; and it is, I think, worth showing how, by means of these relations, we pass from the equation between X', Y', Z' to that between X, Y, Z. In fact, representing, for shortness, the foregoing relations by X12: Y'2: Z'2: Y'Z': Z'X: X'Y'=A: B: C: F: G: H, we may write X'=AF=GH, Y'=BG=HF, Z'=CH=FG, ABC=FGH; and thence X'3=AF. G2H2 Y'3= BG. H2P, Z3CH . F2G2, X'Y'Z'= F2G2H2; hence + 12(X13+Y'3 + Z'3) _(1 + 213)X'Y'ZI' =FGH{ +12(AGH+BHF+ CFG) (1 +213)FGH}. But we have + 12(AGH+BHF+ CFG) -(215 + 18)(X3 +Y3 + Z3)XYZ + (14+217)(Y3Z3+ Z3X3+X3Y3) -(1 +213)FGH (15 + 218)(X3 +Y3+ Z3)XYZ + (14 + 217)(Y3Z3+ Z3X3 +X3Y3) + l3(1 13)(1+213)X2Y2Z2; and thence + 12(AGH+BHF+CFG)-(1 +213)FGH 13(1 _ 13) {12(Xii3+Y3+Z3)XYZ (1 +213)X2Y2Z2}; and finally, + 12(X13 + Y13 + Z'3) -(1 + 213)X'Y'Z' 15 (1+ 14)(lYZ X2)(lZX Y2)(lXY_ Z2)XYZ X {l12(X3+Y3+ Z3)-(1l+ 2l3)XYZ }. 3 I2 420 MR. A. CAYLEY'S MEMOIR ON CURVES OF THE THIRD ORDER. We have also, identically, ABC-FGH =1l (_ + 14)XYZ { 12(X3 + Y3 +Z3)-(1 +213)XYZ }, which agrees with the relation ABC-FGI=0. 7. Before going further, it will be convenient to investigate certain relations which exist between the quantities (X, Y, Z), (X', Y', Z'), connected as before by the equations XX'+I(YZ' +Y'Z) =0, YY' +I(ZX' +Z'X) =0, ZZ' +I(XY'+X'Y)=0, and the quantities e YZ' -Y'Z, e= XX' --jYZ'+Y'Z), 8=ZX' Z'X, P YY' (ZX'+Z'X) 4=XY'-X'Y, Y=ZZ' =(XY'+X'Y). 'We have identically, 2XX'(YZ' Y'Z) + (XY' +X'Y)(ZX' Z'X) + (ZX'+ Z'X)(XY' -X'Y)=0; or expressing in terms of j, 4, 4, z, oc, ry the quantities which enter into this equation, and forming the analogous equations, we have 21c4 -r -34 =0 (A) -rE+21p -ac =0 -f3-a +217r=0. We have also X2Y'Z' X2YZ = 1 {-(XY'+X'Y)(ZX'_Z'X)+(ZX'+Z'X)(XY'-X'Y) }, and thence in like manner, X2Y'Z' _XYZ (r ) (B) Y2Z' X'-Y'2ZX Z2XIYIX12YZ= l(z 8 Again, we have (YZIYIZ)2= (YZ'+YZ)2-4YY'ZZ' (ZX' Z'X)(XY' -X'Y) -(ZX'+ Z'X)(XY' +X'Y) + 2XX'(YZ'+ -Y'Z); and thence '2 122 4PY (C) 4=2-4py t 212 ~'2 r24~ ? v a MR.

It is obvious that is the equation of the line EF joining the two conjugate poles, and it may be shown that ax+py+7z=0 is the equation of the line IJ, which is the polar of E with respect to a conic which is the first or conic polar of F with respect to any syzygetic cubic. In fact, the equation of a syzygetic cubic will be X3 +y3+z3+ 6;?xyz =0, where x is arbitrary, and the equation of the line in question is (Xbx+Y~y+ Zb)(X'ax+Yay+ Zl'b)(X3 +y+z3+6xyz)= 0; or developing, XX'x+YY'y,+ ZZ'z +X{(YZ'+Y'Z)x+(ZX'+Z'X)y+ (XY'+X'Y)z} =0; and the function on the left-hand side is ( 1 (ax+ Py+yz), which proves the theorem. 9. The equations (A) by the elimination of (M, a, E), give -1(ca3+ P3+y3)+ (-1+413)c)fy= 0, which shows that the line IJ is a tangent of the Pippian: the proof of the theorem is given in this place because the relation just obtained between a, 3, y is required for the proof of some of the other theorems. 422 MR. A. CAYLEY'S MEMOIR ON CURVES OF THE THIRD ORDER. 10. To find the coordinates of the point G in which the line EF joining two conjugate poles again meets the Hessian. We may take for the coordinates of G, uX+vX', UY+vY', UZ+vZ'; and substituting in the equation of the Hessian the terms containing b3', V3 disappear, and the ratio u: v is determined by a simple equation. It thus appears that we may write -= 312(XX'2+YY'2 +ZZ'2)+ (1 + 213)(Y'Z'X+Z'X'Y+X'Y'Z) v= 312(X2X+Y2Y' +Z2Z')(1 + 213)(YZX'+ ZXY' +XYZ'); hence introducing, as before, the quantities E, , Za, A, o, rw we find uX+vX'=312(ryn34)+ (1 +213)(X2Y'Z'-X'2YZ); but from the first of the equations (B), X2Y'Z'X2YZ= (Yo7 3 ), and therefore the preceding value of uX+vX' becomes (312_ 1+'2)(13 2PM) which is equal to 2-1+4l Hence throwing out the constant factor, we find, for the coordinates of the point G, the values II. To find the coordinates of the point 0. Consider 0 as the point of intersection of the tangents to the Hessian at the points E, F, then the coordinates of 0 are proportional to the terms of 3l2X2-1+213YZ, 312Y2 -1+213ZX, 31Z2 1+21AXYl 312X2-_1+213Y'Z', 312Y'2-_ 1+213Z'X', 312Zt2 1 +213XIY'. Hence the x-coordinate is proportional to (312Y2-1 +2l3ZX)(3l2Z2_ 1+213X'Y') (312Z2 1+2l3XY)3PYI2_ 1+2l3Z'X'), which is equal to 914(Y2Z'2_y'2Z2) +312(1 +213)YY'(XY' -X'Y)+ 3P(1 +2P)ZZ'(ZX'-Z'X) (1 +213)2XX'(YZ' Y'Z); or introducing, as before, the quantities ;, to 4, s, 1, y, to -913'4+ 312(1+2l3)(I+r 2)-(1+23)2t4 MR. A. CAYLEY'S MEMOIR ON CURVES OF TEE THIRD ORDER. 423 But by the first of the equations (A) P3+ryn21=l, and the preceding value thus becomes (-1 7l3+8l6)4 Hence throwing out the constant factor the coordinates of the point 0 are found to be Ail, H r4. 12. The points G, 0 are conjugate poles of the cubic. Take a, b, c for the coordinates of G, and a', b', c' for the coordinates of 0, we have a, b, c=r71-pt., j3d-ct, These values give aa'+l(bd'+b'c) -n(r'y-+ 1) + l{7(I3lap) + y'((cry+a) } y 6Gzr+ 12) + 72( -bxf3)+ 42(lar) + ( ceI tly2); or substituting for $n, ,2, 62, 6 their values in terms of a, Ay, r this is (_2 4 1rt) (cyr+ if3) + ( 1-4rc?) (-EMS~f) + (2 4ofp)(lapr + (12 r4ap# (1osy) -2(2a1 )(~ _~l Iy2)J which is identically equal to zero. Hence, completing the system, we find aa'+l(bc' +6'c) O, bb' +l(ca'+c'a) O, cc' + l(ab'+ a'b) = 0, equations which show that 0 (as well as G) is a point of the Hessian, and that the points G, 0 are corresponding poles of the cubic. 13. The line EF joining a pair of conjugate poles of the cubic is a tangent of the Pippian *. In fact, the equations (A), by the elimination of cc, 3, y, give 1(63+n3+43)+( -I+ 413)6n4= 0 which proves the theorem. 14. To find the equation of the pair of lines through F, and to show that these lines are tangents of the Pippian. The equation of the pair of lines considered as the first or conic polar of the conjugate pole E, is X(2+21yz)+Y(y2+21zx)+Z(z2+21xy)=0. * STEINER'S curve R0, in the particular case of a cubic basisacurve, is according to definition the envelope of the line ESF, that is, the curve II1 inl the particular case in question is the Pippian. 424 MIR.

To find the equation of the pair of lines through 0. The equation of the pair of lines through E is in like manner X'(x2+ 2 1yz) + YI(y2 + 2 lzx) + Z'(z2+ 2lxy)=0; and combining this with the foregoing equation, X($2+ 2lyz) +Y(y2+21zx) +Z(z2+ 2lxy) = 0 of the pair of lines through F, viz. multiplying the two equations by X2X' +Y2yt+ Z2Z', _ (XXf2+YY12+ ZZ'2), and adding, then if as before a: b: c=ry-P4: a-r6:I 3 a-, we find as the equation of a conic passing through the points A, B, C, D, the equation a(x2+ 2lyz)+b(y2+2lzx)+c(z2+2ilxy)=0. But putting, as before, a': 1':dos: j3: t then a', Ii, c' are the coordinates of the point 0, and the equations aa'+l(bc'+b'c) = 0, bb' + l(ca'+c'a) = 0, cc' + l(ab'+a'b)=0 show that thle conic in question is in fact the pair of lines through the point 0.

The coordinates of the point in question are uX-vX', UY-vY', UZ-vZ', where u, v have the values given in No. 10, viz. 312(XXt2+yy'2 +ZZ12)+ (1 +213)(Y'Z'X+Z'X'Y+X'Y'Z)I V= 312(X2XI+Y2Y'+Z2Z') (1+213)(YZX' +ZXY' +XYZ'); these values give uXvX'= 312{2X2X12+(XY'+X'Y)YY'+(XZ'+X'Z)ZZ'} +(1 + 213){ (XY' + X'Y)(XZ'+X'Z) +XX'(YZ' +Y'Z }; and therefore aX vX' =312 2GC2v (+ 213)tlF Ma} 12(1+8l3)( lCe2+/3r); and consequently, omitting the constant factor, the coordinates of F may be taken to be _la2 +I3 y _ Jl32+7,Ya, _ ley2+c43. 17. The line through two consecutive positions of the point F is the line EF. The coordinates of the point F are . ea2+/y -79 /12+ya, ly2+MP; and it has been shown that the quantities ix, 3, y satisfy the equation -1(0V3+p3+73)+(_ 1+413)Pey= 0.

The lineo-polar envelope of the line EF, with respect to the cubic, is the pair of lines OE, OF.

The equations (A) show that the two lines aX+PY +4z=0, Gx +f3y + 4z= 0, (where X, a, 4 and a, P, y have the values before attributed to them) are conjugate polars with respect to the curve of the third class, 1(63+43+43) 3644=0, in which equation 6, a, 4 denote current line coordinates.

Article No. 20.-Theorem relating to the curve of the third class, mentioned in the preceding article. 20. The consideration of the curve 3T.PU-4S.QU=0, gives rise to another geometrical theorem. Suppose that the line (6, a, t), that is, the line whose equation is Ex+)y+ z= 0, is with respect to this curve of the third class one of the four polars of a point (X, Y, Z) of the Hessian, and that it is required to find the envelope of the line 6x+?y+Uz=0.

Article No. 21.Geometrical definition of the Quippian. 21. I have not succeeded in obtaining any good geometrical definition of the Quippian, and the following is only given for want of something better. The curve T. PU{P6H(vcU+6P3HU)} -P6HU{T(oU+631HU). P(aU+61HU)} =0 which is derived in what may be taken to be a known manner from the cubic, is in general a curve of the sixth class. But if the syzygetic cubic zU+63lHU =0 be properly selected, viz. if this curve be such that its Hessian breaks up into three lines, then both the Pippian of the cubic acU+6f3HU=0, and the Pippian of its Hessian will break up into the same three points, which will be a portion of the curve of the sixth class, and discarding these three points the curve will sink down to one on the third class, and will in fact be the Quippian of the cubic. MR. A. CAYLEY'S MEMOIR ON CURVES OF THE THIRD ORDER. 429 To show this we may take aU+6@HU=x3+y'+z'= 0 as the equation of the syzygetic cubic satisfying the prescribed condition, for this value in fact gives H(oU+6PHIJ)= -xyz 0, a system of three lines. We find, moreover, P(zU+ 6fHU)=P(X3+yl+zZ) -n4 and P {6H(aoU + 6HU)} = P(6xyz) =-4 4, the latter equation being obtained by first neglecting all but the highest power of I in the expression of PU, and then writing I_ -1: we have also T(cU+613HU)= 1. Substituting the above values, the curve of the sixth class is G4{ -4T.PU+P(6HU)} =0; or throwing out the factor in7, we have the curve of the third class, -4T.PU+P(6HU)=O. Now the general expression in my Third Memoir, viz. P(xU+ 6PHU)= (e3 + 12So432+ 4T3')PU + (v2p 4SP3)QU, putting ca=0, 3= 1, gives P(6HU)=4T.PU4S. QU, or what is the same thing, .4T.PU+P(6HU)= -4S.QU; and the curve of the third class is therefore the Quippian QU=0. It may be remarked, that for a cubic U= 0 the Hessian of which breaks up into three lines, the above investigation shows that we have PU= -n, P(6HU)= 464, and T= 1, and consequently that -4T.PU+P(6HU) ought to vanish identically; this in fact happens in virtue of the factor S on the right-hand side, the invariant S of a cubic of the form in question being equal to zero; the appearance of the factor S on the right-hand side is thus accounted for 'apriori. Article No 22.-Theorem relating to a line which meets three given conies in six points in involution. 22. The envelope of a line which meets' three given conics, the first or conic polars of any three points with respect to the cubic, in six points in involution, is the Pippian. It is readily seen that if the theorem is true with respect to the three conics, dU dU dU dz? dy-? dz? it is true with respect to any three conics whatever of the form dU dU dU a dx 1, 1y 430 MR. A. CAYLEY'S MEMOIR ON CURVES OF THE THIRD ORDER. that is, with respect to any three conics, each of them the first or conic polar of some point (A, A, P) with respect to the cubic. Considering then these three conics, take as the equation of the line >x+?y+tz=O, and let (X, Y, Z) be the coordinates of a point of intersection with the first conic, we have (X+Y+4Z =0, X2+2lYZ=O; and combining with these a linear equation MX+PY+yZ=O , in which (a, j3, y) are arbitrary quantities, we have X: Y: Z=PY4 AX: OG-ty6 P6-'X4; and hence an equation in (a, ,y) which is in fact the equation in line coordinates of the two points of intersection with the first conic.

Now combining these equations with the equation y=0, we have the equations of the pairs of lines joining the points of intersection with the point (x=0, y= 0), and if the six points are in involution, the six lines must also be in involution, or the condition for the involution of the six points is -2144, 42v 1641 =0 425 -214;7 14K, 82 62 _6 142 that ils; 4124264( --n 681) + 14343 + 16343 _+212~24229+,212+24242 +44(8142) 0; or reducing and throwing out the factor 43, we find _-1(63 + 3 + 3) +( _ +413)S44=01 which shows that the line in question is a tangent of the Pipplan. It is to be remarked that any three conics whatever may be considered as the first or conic polars, of three properly selected points with respect to a properly selected cubic curve. The theorem applies therefore to any three conics whatever, but in this case the cubic curve is not given, and the Pippian therefore stands merely for a curve of the third class, and the theorem is as follows, viz. the envelope of a line which meets any three conies~~~ in si onsi noltoi 2,uv o h hr ls MR. A. CAYLEY'S MEMOIR ON CURVES OF THE THIRD ORDER. 431 Article No. 23.'-Completion of the theory in LIouville, and comparison with analogous theorems of HESSE. In order to convert the foregoing theorem into its reciprocal, we must replace the cubic U= 0 by a curve of the third class, that is we must consider the coordinates which enter into the equation as line coordinates; and it of course follows that the coordinates which enter into the equation PU=0 must be considered as point coordinates, that is we must consider the Pippian as a curve of the third order: we have thus the theorem; The locus of a point such that the tangents drawn from it to three given conics (the first or conic poles of any three lines with respect to a curve of the third class) form a pencil in involution, is the Pippian considered as a curve of the third order. This in fact completes the fundamental theorem in my memoirs in Lioztville above referred to, and establishes the analogy with HESSE's results in relation to the Hessian; to show this I set out the two series of theorems as follows: HESSE, in his memoirs " On Curves of the Third Order and Curves of the Third Class," Crelle, tt. xxviii. xxxvi. and xxxviii., has shown as follows:(ca) The locus of a point such that its polars, with respect to thethree conics X =0, Y=O, Z =O (or more generally its polars with respect to all the conics of the series XX+pY+vZ=0) meet in a point, is a curve of the third order V=0. (j3) Conversely, given a curve of the third order V=0, there exists a series of conies such that the polars with respect to all the conics of any point whatever of the curve V =0, meet in a point. (y) The equation of any one of the conics in question is dU dU dU that is, the conic is the first or conic polar of a point (p, Y&, v) with respect to a certain curve of the third order U= 0; and this curve is determined by the condition that its Hessian is the given curve V=O, that is, we have V=HU. (I) The equation V=HU is solved by assuming U=aV+bHV, for we have then H(aV+bHV)=AV+BHV, where A, B are given cubic functions of a, b, and thence V=HU=AV+BHV, or A=1, B=0; the latter equation gives what is alone important, the ratio a: b, and it thus appears that there are three distinct series of conics, each of them having the above-mentioned relation to the given curve of the third order V 0. In the memoirs in Liouville above referred to, I have in effect shown that(a') The locus of a point such that the tangents from it to three conies, represented in line coordinates by the equations X=0, Y= 0, Z=0 (or more generally with respect to any three conics of the series XX+?Y+Z= 0) form a pencil in involution, is a curve of the third order V=0. (3') Conversely, given a curve of the third order V-0, there exists a series of conies such that the tangents from any point whatever of the curve to any three of the conics, form a pencil in involution. 432 MR. A. CAYLEY'S, MEMOIR ON CURVES OF THE THIRD ORDER. Noxw, considering the coordinates which enter into the equation of the Pippian as point coordinates, and consequently the Pippian as a curve of the third order, I am able to add as follows: (y') The equation in line coordinates of any one of the conics in question is dU dU dU that is, the conic is the first or conic polar of a line (X, A, v) with respect to a certain curve of the third class U =0; and this curve is determined by the condition that its Pippian is the given curve of the third order V=0, that is, we have V=PU. (6) The equation V=PU is solved by assuming U=aPV+bQV, for we have then P(aPV+bQV)=AV+BI-JV, where A and B are given cubic functions of a, b; and thence V=PU=AV+BHV, or A=1, B=0; the latter equation gives what is alone important, the ratio a: b; and it thus appears that there are three distinct curves of the third class U=0, and therefore (what indeed is shown in the Memoirs in Liouville) three distinct series of conics having the above-mentioned relation to the given curve of the third order V=0. It is hardly necessary to remark that the preceding theorems, although precisely analogous to those of HESSE, are entirely distinct theorems, that is the two series are not connected together by any relation of reciprocity.

Reverting to the theorem (No. 18), that the lineo-polar envelope of the line EF is the pair of lines OE, OF; the line EF is any tangent of the Pippian, hence the theorem includes the following one:The lineo-polar envelope with respect to the cubic, of any tangent of the Pippian, is a pair of lines. And conversely, The Pippian is the envelope of a line such that the lineo-polar envelope of the line with respect to the cubic is a pair of lines. It is I think worth while to give an independent proof. It has been shown that the equation of the lineo-polar envelope with respect to the cubic, of the line 6x +y + 4z= 0 (where 6, a, 4 are arbitrary quantities), is (l62 l4, 2l4; , _ 1242? 217 , 2 + 12, 2+ j24, 142+ l2,)cv y, )2_ 0; and representing this equation by -O(a, b, c, f, g, heX, y, Z)2=0, we find be _ f=2 (_ 3+8134,3+81343+12126nt)5 cf_2=2 ((813 . 8V3 + 8l3 +12l,), a6-h2= (8l' 3+813Z. 43 + 12lf74), MR.

In fact the geometrical theory shows that we must have F.U-NTI=(Ex+ny+4Z)2(E'X+nty+'Z), and it is then clear that N is a mere number. To determine its value in the most simple manner, write 1=0, y= 0, x =, z= , we have then F.U -NHI=0, where F=V6+;76+462 28343 243a3--2Zf3431 U=43_E3. The value of 11 is II=F . U, and we thus obtain N=1.

The expression last written down is therefore the value of E20/ or dividing by { we have i', and then the values of p', 4' are of course known, and we obtain the identical equation F.U-II= (1 + 813)(E4 2tt-2{t 6 4 2)x, (EX+ ,y+ Z)24 + (1 + 813)(n4 2432nE3 61E2),y 1+(1+813)(442432443 61fi2,2)zJ and the second factor equated to zero is the equation of the satellite line of fx+qy+4z 0. 33. The point of intersection of the line Ex+ny+tz_=O with the satellite line ,x+riy+4'z= 0 is the satellite point of the former line; and the coordinates of the satellite point are at once found to be $ Z = (41 _43) (n4+21E2) :(43_ E3)(4 + 2142) (t3 _43)(x+214:). 34. If the primary line Ex+,y+4z=O is a tangent to the cubic, then (xl, Yi, zj) being the coordinates of the point of contact, we have E: 4: 4=x +21ylz, yA+21zlxj: za+21xyl; these values give as before t3_43= -(1 +813 X3(,,3 z3) and they give also n4+21E2= (1 + 813)y2Z2 and consequently we obtain x y: & ( zl(X) that is, the satellite point of a tangent of the cubic is the point in which this tangent again meets the cubic.

W~e have y3+z3=(43_ 3)3(46+21,2)3 +R +3_4 3)3(6n +2 142)35 and it is easy to see that the function on the right-hand side must divide by &-4: hence X3+y3+Z3 will also divide by 43_43, and consequently by (ns_ 49)(Z3 33). We have (y3+Z3) *(43_43)= 63 49 63 _3n6 _9 +363(46+4343+46) 366(43?+,3) +61624242 { _ 46 _43;3 _6+ 363(43 + n3) 3~6} +12124n4 { _ 343 (43 + 3) +3 3834343, 69 +8l3 {_ 646+34343~ 6 (43+43) 99 and 3 .3_3)= ( 36 3+46)(4343+ 6124242+ 4 8l366).

MR. A. CAYLEY'S MEMOIR ON CURVES OF THE THIRD ORDER. 441 The coefficient of +343 + 3+ 343 on the right-hand side will vanish if (1 + 213)A+12B=O, or, what is the same thing, if A= 12, B= -(1+213); and substituting these values, we obtain { 12(X3+y3?+z3)-(1 + 2) 4} + 3)(43_3)(3 3) _ 12(e3 + 3 + 3) + (-41+ 414) (ff3+43 + 43)E4U +(-1+813= 1616)E242422 or, what is the same thing, 12(X3+y3 +Z3) _-(1 +213)xy= 3-) -fi )(t 3) X {-_1(03+43+43)+(_ 1+413)Xn4}2. Hence the left-hand side vanishes in virtue of the relation between (, a, 4, or we have 12Q(i3+y3+Z3)_(1 +213)xyz 0, which proves the theorem. 36. Suppose that (X, Y, Z) are the coordinates of a point of the Hessian, and let (P, Q, R) be the coordinates of the point in which the tangent to the Hessian at the point (X, Y, Z) again meets the Hessian, or, what is the same thing, the satellite point in regard to the Hessian of the tangent at (X, Y, Z). And consider the conic X($2 + 2 1yz) + Yy2 + 2 lzx) + Z(X2 + 2 Ixy), which is the first or conic polar of the point (X, Y, Z) in respect of the cubic. The polar (in respect to this conic) of the point (P, Q, R) will be where a=PX+l(RY+QZ), g=QY+l(PZ+RX), 4=RZ+l(QX+PY); or putting for (P, Q, R) their values, E=(y3_Z3)(X2 _YZ), 27=(Z3_X3)(y9-_JZX)j K=(X3 y3)(Z2 _XY). And if from these equations and the equation of the Hessian we eliminate (X, Y, Z), we shall obtain the equation in line coordinates of the curve which is the envelope of the line gx+4y+z= 0.

We have thus the theorem,The envelope of the polar of the satellite point in respect to the Hessian of the tangent at any point of the Hessian, such polar being in respect of the conic which is the first or conic polar of the point of the Hessian in respect of the cubic, is the Pippian. Article Nos. 37 to 40.-Investigations and theorems relating to the first or conic polar of a point of the cubic. 37. The investigations next following depend on the identical equations {M(X2+ 2lYZ) +?(Y2+2lZX) +py(Z2+2lXY)} X { XYZ(X3+y3+z3)+(X8+y3+Z3)xyz} = {X(x2+2lyz)+Y(y2+2lzx)+Z(z2+2l xy)} X {X(Y3Z3)(7yPz)+Y(Z3-X3)(cZ_ yX)+Z(X3-Y3)(PQX -cy)I + {x(X2+21YZ)+y(Y2+ 21ZX)+z(Z2+2lXY)} X {(aYZ+fZX+ yXY)(xX2+yy2+zZ2)+(iX2+PY2+yZ2)(Xyz+YZX+Z y)} which is easily verified. I represent the equation in question by KT=WL+PO; then considering (x, y, z) as current coordinates, and (X, Y, Z) and (o, A, y) as the coordinates of two given points Y and Q2, we shall have U=O the equation of the cubic, W 0 the equation of the first or conic polar of : with respect to the cubic, P= 0 the equation of the second or line polar of E with respect to the cubic. The equation T1==0 is that of a syzygetic cubic passing through the point E: the coordinates of the satellite point in respect to this syzygetic cubic of its tangent at E are X(Y3Z3): Y(Z3 X3) Z(X3-YS) and calling the point in question ', then L=0 is the equation of a line through the points A', i2. The equation 0 = is that of a conic, viz. the first or conic polar of z with respect to a certain syzygetic cubic -2(osYZ+PZX+YXY)(cv3+y3+z3) + (cX2+3y2+rZ2)yz= 0, MR. A. CAYLEY'S MEMOIR ON CURVES OF TE THIRD ORDER. 443 depending on the points I, fl, or, what is the same thing, the conic 0=0 is a properly selected conic passing through the points of intersection of the first or conic polars of Y with respect to any two syzygetic cubics; and lastly, K is a constant coefficient. The equation expresses that the points of intersection of (W=0, P=0), (W=0, 0=0), (L=0, P=O), (L=O, 0=0), lie in the syzygetic cubic T= O. The left-hand side of the equation may be written -XYZ {fc(X2+21YZ) +P(Y2+ 21ZX)+ r(Z2+ 2lXY) } (X3 +y3 +z3 + 6l xyz) +xz{a(X2+2lYZ)+P(Y2+21ZX)+y(Z2+2lXY)}(X3+Y3+Z3+6lXYZ); and it may be remarked also that we have 3XYZ{ca(X2+21YZ)+13(y2+2lZX) + ,(Z2+21XY)} equal identically to {X(Y3 Z3)(yY-1Z) +Y(Z3-X3)(ocZ -yX) +Z(X3-Y3)(XMY)} -(ADYZ+j3ZX+yXY)(X3+Y3+Z3+61XYZ). Hence if we assume X3+Y3+Z3+61XYZ= , the equation will take the form KU=WL+PO, where the constant coefficient K may be expressed under the two different forms K= -XYZ {J(X2+21YZ)+p(Y2+21ZX)+y(Z2+2lXY)} 1 {X(Y3 Z3)(7Y _PZ) + Y(Z3-_X3)(&Z yX) +Z(X3-Y3)(X--Y) }, and W, L, P, 0 have the same values as before. In the present case the point I is a point of the cubic: the equation W= O represents the first or conic polar of the point in question, and the equation P= 0 its second or line polar, which is also the tangent of the cubic. The line L= O is a line joining the point fl with the satellite point of the tangent at Z, or dropping altogether the consideration of the point Q, is an arbitrary line through the satellite point: the first or conic polar of I meets the cubic twice in the point 1, and therefore also meets it in four other points; the conic 0=0 is a conic passing through these four points, and completely determined when the particular position of the line through the satellite point is given. And, as before remarked, 0=0 is a conic passing through the points of intersection of the first or conic polars of z with respect to any two syzygetic cubics. We have thus the theorem,The first or conic polar of a point of the cubic touches the cubic at this point, and besides meets it in four other points; the four points in question are the points in which the first or conic polar of the given point in respect of the cubic is intersected by the first or conic polar of the same point in respect to any syzygetic cubic whatever, 38. The analytical result may be thus stated: putting x c&YZ+IZX+rXY, X zX2+1Y2+rZ2, 3 M2 444 MR. A. CAYLEY'S MEMOIR ON CURVES OF THE THIRD ORDER. or, if we please, considering x, ?2 as arbitrary parameters, then the four points lie in the conic (2zX, 2zY, 2KZ, -AX, -KY, .-XZjx, y Z))2=0, or, what is the same thing, they are the points of intersection of the two conics XX2+yy2 +Zz2 =01 Xyz+Yzx+Zxy= O. 39. Considering the four points as the angles of a quadrangle, it may be shown that the three centres of the quadrangle lie on the cubic. To effect this, assume that the conic (2zX, 2zY, 2zZ, -XX, -iY, -XZlX, y, Z)2= 0 represents a pair of lines; these lines will intersect in a point, which is one of the three centres in question. And taking x, y, z as the coordinates of this point, we have XI y2: 2 yZ:zx: xy= 4Z2YZ 2X2 :4K2ZX2y2 4 4X2XY_42Z2 :X2YZ+2;,XX2 :42ZX+2KXY2 X2XY+2XZ2; and we may, if we please, use these equations to find the relation between x, A. Thus in the identical equation x>.f-(xy)20, substituting for x2, y y2 their values, and throwing out the factor Z, we find (4z 3_3)XYZ-_;.. 2(X3+Y3+Z3) 0 and thence, in virtue of the equation X3+Y3 +Z3+61XYZ=O, we obtain 4X3 + 6 IZ2 _3= 0. But the preceding system gives conversely, X2: Y2: Z2: YZ: ZX: XY=4z~yz-X2a2 4z2ZX-X2yf :4zxxy _4Z2 : 2yz+2zve 42zx+ 2z.ft :2Xy+2zXz2 Hence from the identical relation X2.Y2 (XY)2 0, substituting for X2, XY, Y2 their values, and throwing out the factor z, we find (4Z3 _3)Xyz_ x%3 +y3+Z3) 0, and thence, in virtue of the equation 4z3 x361zX2, we obtain + 3+y3+Z3+ 61xyz 0, which shows that the point in question lies on the cubic. We have thus the theorem,The first or conic polar of a point of the cubic touches the cubic at the point, and MR. A. CAYLEY'S MEMOIR ON CURVES OF THE THIRD ORDER. 445meets it besides in four points, which are the angles of a quadrangle the centres of which lie on the cubic. In other words, the quadrangle is an inscribed quadrangle. 40. To find the equations of the axes of the quadrangle, that is of the lines through two centres. We have (4z2YZ _ k2X2)X + (X2XY+2;XZ2)y+ (X2ZX+ 2zXY2)z= 0 (X2XY+2ZXZ2)X+(4z2ZXX2y2)y +(X2YZ + 2z;CX2)z= 0 (;2ZX+ 2zXY2)x +(X2yZ + 2xXX2) + (4z2XYX2Z2)z =0; or arranging these equations in the proper form and eliminating x2, zx , x2 we find YZX, Z2y+y2Z, X(-Xa7+Yy+ZZ) =0; ZXy, X2Z+Z2X, Y( XX-Yy+Zz) XYZ, Y2X+X2y, Z( XX+YyZz) or multiplying out, XYZ {Z3 Y3)X3 +(X3-Z3)y3+(y ( X3)Z31 +X2yZY2 (_ 2X3+y3+Z3)+ZX2YZ2(2X3 _ -Z3) +fy2zXZ2 (-2Y3+Z3+X3) +xyzZX2(2y3 Z3 X3) +z2xYX2( -2Z3 +X3+Y3)+yz2XY2(2Z3 X3Y3)= 0. We may simplify this result by means of the equation X3+Y3+Z3 +61XYZ=O, so as to make the left-hand side divide out by XYZ: we thus obtain (Z3-Y3)X3+ (X3_ Z3)y3 +(Y3_X3)Z3 +(3X2Y6lY2Z)X2y +( 3Y2Z 61Z2X)y2z + ( ' 3Z2X61X2Y)z2X +( 3XY2+ 61X2Z)Xy2z+ 3YZ2+ 61y2X)yz2 +( 3ZX2+ 61Z2Y)zX2= 0; or in a different form, (y3 -z3)X3 +(Z3-_3)Y3 +(X3 _13)Z3 + ( 3x2y61z2X)X2y+(_ 3y2z612y)y2Z +(3z2x-6 ly2z)Z2X + 3xy2+ 6lyz2)XY2+( 3yz2+ 61ZX2)YZ2 +( 3zx2+ 6Xy2)ZX2 0o as the equation of the three axes of the quadrangle.
