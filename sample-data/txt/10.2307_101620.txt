A Relation Of the abundance of Wood, found under ground in Lincolnshire; communicated by a Friend, well acquainted with that Country. THat Fenny Tract, call'd the Isle of Axholme, lying part in Lincoln-shire and part in York-shire, and extending a considerable way, hath anciently been a Woody Country, witness the abundance of Oak, Firr, and other Trees, of late frequently found in the Moore; where of some Oak are five yards in compass, and sixteen yards long; others smaller and longer, with good quantities of Akorns near them, lying somewhat above three foot in depth, and near their roots, which do still stand as they grew, viz. in firm Earth below the Moor. The Firrs lye a foot or eighteen Inches deeper, more in number than Oak, and many of them thirty yards long; one of them being, not many years since, taken up of thirty six yards long besides the top; lying also near the root, which stood likewise as it grew, having been burnt and not cut down, as the Oak had been also. The Number of these trees is reported by Mr. Dugdale, in his Book of Drayning the Fens in England (where you will find this whole narrative confirm'd) to be so great, that the Inhabitants have, for divers years last past, taken up many Cart-loads in a year. As to the first time of the overflowing of this Woody level, no Account is given, that I know of, not by the Inquisitive and Learned Antiquary Mr. Dugdale himself. He only saith, that the (2051) the depth of the Moor evinceth, that it hath been so for divers.hundreds of years, since that could not grow to that thickness it is of, in a few Ages. Of the Cause thereof he concludeth, that to have been the Muddiness of the constant Tydes, which flowing up Humber into Trent, left in time so much filth, as to obstruct the Currents of Idle Done, and other Rivers, which thence flow'd back and overwhelm'd that flat Country.
