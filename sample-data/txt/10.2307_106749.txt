[40] VI. Catalogue of Double Stars. By William Herschel, Esq. F. R. S. Read December 9, 1784. I N T R O D U C T O R Y R E M A R K S. THE great use of Double Stars having been already pointed out in a former paper, on the Parallax of the Fixed Stars, and in a latter one, on the Motion of the Solar System, I have now drawn up a second collection of 434 more, which I have found out since the first was delivered. The happy opportunity of giving all my time to the pursuit of astronomy, which it has pleased the Royal Patron of this Society to furnish me with, has put it in my power to make the present collection much more perfect than the former; almost every double star in it having the distance and position of its two stars measured by proper micrometers; and the observations have been much oftener repeated. The method of classing them is in every respect the same as that which has been used in the first collection; for which reason I refer to the introductory remarks that have been given with that collection * for an explanation of several particulars necessary to be previously known. The numbers of the stars are here also continued, so that the first class ending there at * See Philosophical Transactions, vol. LXXII. p. 112. 24 Mr. HERSCHEL'S Catalogue of Double Stars. 41 24 begins here at 25, and the same is done with the other classes. Most of the double stars in my first collection are among the number of those stars which have their places determined in Mr. FLAMSTEED'S extensive catalogue; but of this collection many are not contained in that author's work, I have therefore adopted a method of pointing them out, which it will be proper to describe. The finder of my reflector is limited, by a proper diaphragm, to a natural field of two degrees of a great circle in diameter. The intersection of the cross wires, in the center of it, points out one degree; and by the eye this degree, or the distance from the center to the circumference, may be divided into 1/4, 1/2, 3/4, 1/3, and 2/3. Thus we are furnished with a measure which, though coarse, is however sufficiently accurate for the purpose here intended; and which, if more than two degrees are wanted, may be repeated at pleasure. In such measures as these I have given the distance of a double star, whose place I wanted to point out, from the nearest star in FLAMSTEED'S Catalogue. And since, besides the distance, it is also required to have its position with regard to the star thus referred to, I have used the neighbouring stars for the purpose of pointing it out. The usefulness of this method is so extensive, that I shall be a little more particular in describing its application. When a star is thus pointed out, as for instance the 32d in the first class, where it is said, `` About 3/4 degree s. preceding the 44th Lyncis, `` in a line parallel to ~ Ursae majoris and the 39th Lyncis;'' we are to apply one eye to the finder, and placing the 44th Lyncis into the center of the field, we are to look at ~ Ursae major's and the 39th Lyncis in the heavens with the other eye by the VOL. LXXV. G side 42 Mr. HERSCHEL'S Catalogue side of the finder. The naked eye then will immediately direct us, by means of the two stars just mentioned, towards the place where, in the finder, the armed eye will perceive the double star in question about 3/4 degree from the 44th Lyncis. I need hardly observe, that we must recollect the inversion of the finder, as those who are in the habit of using telescopes with high powers, always furnished with inverting finders, will of course look for the small star in the upper part of the field, as in fig. 1. At the 45th star, in the first class, the description says, `` About 11/4 degree s. preceding ~, towards ~ Aurigae.'' This double star will accordingly be found by placing ~ Aurigae first into the center of the finder; then, drawing the telescope towards ~, which the naked eye points out, the star we look for will begin to appear in the circumference as soon as ~ is about 1/4 degree removed from the center, as in fig. 2. It will sometimes happen, that other stars are very near those which are thus pointed out, that might be mistaken for them. In such cases an additional precaution has been used by mentioning some circumstance either of magnitude or situation, to distinguish the intended star from the rest. After all, if any observer should be still at a loss to find these stars without having their right ascension and declination, he may furnish himself with them by means of FLAMSTEED'S Atlas Coelestis; for my description will be sufficiently exact for him to make a point in the maps to denote the star's place; then, by means of the graduated margin, he will have its ~ and declination to the time of the Atlas, which he may reduce to any other period by the usual computations. Before I quit this subject I must remark, that it will be found on trial, that this method of pointing out a double star is not only of Double Stars. 43 only equal, but indeed superior, to having its right ascension and declination given: for, since it is to be viewed with very high powers, not such as fixed instruments are generally furnished with, the given right ascension and declination would be of no service. We might, indeed, find the star by a fixed or equatorial instrument; and, taking notice of its situation with regard to other neighbouring stars, find, and view it afterwards, by a more powerful telescope; but this will nearly amount to the very same way which here is pursued, with more deliberate accuracy than we are apt to use, while we are employed in seeking out an object to look at. It will be required, that the observer should be furnished with FLAMSTEED'S Atlas Coelestis, which must have the stars marked from the author's catalogue, by a number easily added to every star with pen and ink, as I have done to mine. The catalogue should also be numbered by an additional column, after that which contains the magnitudes. I hope in some future editions of the Atlas to see this method adopted in print, as the advantage of it is very considerable, both in referring to the catalogue for the place of a star laid down in the Atlas, and in finding a star in the latter whose place is given in the former. I would recommend a precaution to those who wish to examine the closest of my double stars. It relates to the adjust ment of the focus. Supposing the telescope and the observer long enough out in the open air to have acquired a settled temperature, and the night sufficiently clear for the purpose; let the focus of the instrument be re-adjusted with the utmost delicacy upon a star known to be single, of nearly the same altitude, magnitude, and colour, as the star which is to be examined, or upon one star above and another below the G 2 same. 44 Mr. HERSCHEL'S Catalogue same. Let the phaenomena of the adjusting star be well attended to; as, whether it be perfectly round and well defined, or affected with little appendages that frequently keep playing about the image of the star, undergoing small alterations while it passes through the field, at other times remaining fixed to it during the whole passage. Such deceptions may be detected by turning or unscrewing the object-glass or speculum a little in its cell, when those appendages will be observed to revolve the same way. Being thus acquainted with the imperfections as well as perfections of the instrument, and going immediately from the adjusting star, which for that reason also should be as near as may be, to the double star which is to be examined, we may hope to be successful. The astronomical Mr. AUBERT, who did me the honour to follow this method with ~ Leonis, which he did not find to be double when the telescope was adjusted by ~ itself, soon perceived the small star after he had adjusted it upon Regulus. The instrument, being one of Mr. DOLLOND'S best 31/2 feet achromatics, shewed Mr. AUBERT the two stars of ~ Leonis in very close conjunction, or rather one partly hid behind the other. On comparing these appearance~ with my observations of that double star, we must not be surprised to find that I place them at a visible distance from each other: for the Newtonian reflectors, on the plan of my 7-feet one, as I have found, will give a much smaller image of the stars than the 31/2 feet achromatic refractors; wherefore the two stars, which in refractors as it were run into each other, will in the reflector remain separate. For this reason also, those who only use such refractors must not be disappointed if they cannot perceive the 26th, 30, 31, 36, 41, 44, 46, 47, 60, 75, 82, 86, and 87th stars of my first class to be double, A of Double Stars. 45 All the observations in the following catalogue on the relative magnitude, colour, and position of the stars, are to be understood as having been made with a power of 460, unless they are marked otherwise. This will account for the difference which observers may find in the relative magnitude; for should they use only a power of about 200, many of the small stars that are said to be very unequal and extremely unequal, must appear to them perhaps a degree lower in the scale, and become extremely and excessively unequal: and this will happen, though the quantity of light should be the very same which the reflector has that served me to settle these particulars. I need not say, that on other accounts, such as a real difference in the light of the telescope, the presence of the moon, twilights, aurorae boreales, or other causes, many of the small stars may be found to be of a different comparative lustre from what is assigned to them in the catalogue. The small star near Rigel, for instance, appears of a beautiful pale red colour, full, round, and well defined, with my 20-feet reflector; the 10-feet instrument shews it also very well in fine evening; the 7-feet requires more attention, nor is the small star defined, but of a dusky pale red colour. A good 31/2 feet achromatic, of a large aperture, when Rigel is on the meridian, may, perhaps, also shew the small star, although I have not been able to see it with a very good instrument of that sort, which shews the small star that accompanies the pole-star; but the evening was not very favourable. The measures of the distances were all taken with a parallel silk-worm's-thread micrometer, and a power of 227 only. They are not, as in the former catalogue, with the diameters included, but from the center of one star to the center of the other. 46 Mr. HERSCHEL'S Catalogue other. I have adopted these measures on finding that I could procure threads fine enough to subtend only an angle of about 1~ 13~, and that by this means there was no longer any great difficulty of judging when the stars were centrally covered by the threads. However, I do not know whether these measures, with stars at a considerable distance, may not be liable to an additional error of perhaps one second, owing to the remaining uncertainty in judging of their exact central position while the measure is taking. The positions have all been measured (unless marked otherwise) with a power of 460, adapted to an excellent micrometer, executed by Mess. NAIRNE and BLUNT, according to the model given in the Philosophical Transactions, vol. LXXI. page 500. fig. IV.; but with a great and necessary improvement of making the wheel d, d, of that figure perform its whole revolution; by which means the two silk-wormsthreads may be adjusted to a greater degree of exactness; for if they are not placed so as perfectly to bisect the circle, the two threads will not coincide exactly after having performed one semi-revolution, which they must be made to do with the utmost rigour. I found the absolute necessity of this precaution when I came critically to examine the positions of the Georgium Sidus, as they are given in table III. Phil. Trans. vol. LXXI. p. 497. The measures were affected with a small and pretty regular error, which I was at a loss to account for; and the distance of this star being then totally unknown, I looked for the cause of the deviation at first in a diurnal parallax of that heavenly body; but soon found it owing to the inconvenience before-mentioned, of not being able experimentally to adjust the moveable thread to that critical nicety which I have of Double Stars. 47 have now introduced and used in all the angles of the following catalogue*.

November 6th, 1782, I Feb. 8. 1782. * The divisions on the moveable circular index (a) of this micrometer should be read off by means of a line drawn on a small plate fastened to the side t, and projecting with a proper curvature against the plane of the divisions towards r, so as to be nearly in contact; a coincidence of lines being by far the best method of ascertaining the situation of the index. A nonius of four sub-divisions may also be used, whereby the 60 divisions, already divided into halves upon the indexplate, will be had in eighths, each of which, on the construction of my present one, will be equal to three minutes of a degree of the circle. 7 first 48 Mr. HERSCHEL'S Catalogue I. first suspected a separation; and November 13th, fairly saw a division between them.

It is, however, very possible, that the opening which I observed between them, at the latter end of the year 1782 and beginning of 1783, may be owing to very favourable weather, or to my being better acquainted with the object. Could we increase our power and distinctness at pleasure, we might undoubtedly separate any two stars that are not absolutely in a direct line passing through the eye of the observer, and the centers of both the stars. This will appear when we consider that perhaps 59 thirds out of one second, which the diameter of the star may subtend, are spurious; so that a double star seemingly in contact, or even partly hiding each other in appearance, may still be far enough asunder to admit of a fair and considerable separation by applying an adequate magnifying power. It would have been curious, if a considerable difference in the colours could have led us to discover which of the two stars is before the other! But the far greatest part of their apparent diameters being, as we have observed, spurious, it is probable, that a different coloured light of two stars would join together, where the rays of one extend into those of the other; and so, producing a third colour by the mixture of it, still leave the question undecided. best of Double Stars. 49 I. best 1/2 diameter of S.; with 1504, 3/4 diameter, welldefined, and the difference of colours still visible; with 2176, not quite a diameter of S, pretty well defined, but exceedingly tremulous; with 2589, less than 1 diameter; with 3168, still pretty distinct, and about 3/4 diameter of S ~ with 4294, more than a diameter of S, but attended with the utmost difficulty of managing the motions; with 5489, the interval still somewhat larger, and if the object could be kept in the center of the field, the eye might adapt itself to the focus, and get the better of the violent aberration; but the edges of the glass being of a different focus, the eye is constantly disappointed in its endeavours to define the object; with 6652, I had but a single glimpse of the star quite disfigured; however, I ascribe it chiefly to the foulness of the glass, which, on account of its smallness, is extremely difficult to be cleaned; with a 10-feet reflector, 9 inches aperture, power 626, above 1/2 diameter of S. very distinct; with a 20-feet reflector, power 350, too bright an object to be quite distinct, though I see it very well.

The interval between very unequal stars, estimated in diameters, generally gains more by an increase of magnifying power than the apparent distance of those which are nearer of a size. Instances of the former may be found in the first class, the 1st, 7, 29, 35, 37, 39, 53, 59, 63, 64, 72d stars; of the latter, the 16th, 28, 33, 45, 46, 73, 81st stars. However, this only seems to take place when there is a difficulty of seeing the object well with a low power, which being removed by magnifying more, the distance is, as it were, laid open to the view.

It is very visible in low stars; FOMALHAND, for instance, affords a beautiful prismatic spectrum. That this power ought not to be overlooked in delicate 4 and of Double Stars. 89 III. 108.

Position 40~ 33~ n. folSept. 17, 1783. and low observations, is evident from some measures I have taken to ascertain its quantity. Thus I found, May 4, 1783, that the perpendicular diameter of ~, FLAMSTEED's 20th Sagittarii, measured 16~ 9~, while the horizontal was 8~ 35~; which gives 7~ 34~ for the prismatic effect: the measures were taken with 460, near the meridian, and the air remarkably clear. And though this power, which depends on the obliquity of the incident ray, diminishes very fast in greater altitudes, yet I have found its effects perceivable as high, not only as ~ or ~ Corvi in the meridian, but up to Spica Virginis, and even to Regulus. Experiments on these two latter stars I made November 20, 1782; when Regulus, at the altitude of 49~, shewed~ the purple rather fuller at the bottom of the field of view than when it was at the upper edge; which shews that the prismatic powers of the edges of the eye lens were assisted in one situation by the power of the atmosphere, but counteracted by it in the other. I turned the eye lens in all situations, to convince myself that it was not in fault. This experiment explains also, why a star is not always best in the center of the field of view; a fact I have often noticed before I knew the cause. VOL. LXXV.
