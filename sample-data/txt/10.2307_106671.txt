[414] XXVIII. On the Era of the Mahometans, called the Hejera* (~). By William Marsden, Esq. F. R. S. and A. S. Read June 12, 1788. IN their computation of time, the Arabs, and other Mahometan nations, reckon by a year which is purely lunar. It has no reference to the solar revolutions, and is of course unconnected with the vicissitude of seasons. The purpose of its adoption appears to have been chiefly religious, for the regulation of fasts and ceremonies, rather than of the civil concerns of the people. Perhaps a conscious ignorance in matters of science might have determined the institutors to prefer a period whose limits were marked and obvious to the senses, to one whose superior accuracy depended upon astronomical calculation; and it may also be conjectured, that their habits of life rendered the adjustment of the tropical year less interesting to these turbulent and wandering fanatics, than to nations whose attention was directed to agriculture and other peaceful arts. The era of the Mahometans, called by them the Hejera, or Departure, is accounted from the year of the flight of MahoAs this mode of spelling the word differs from that commonly followed, it may be proper to observe, that the Arabic letters of which it is composed are H, j, r, a or ah, and that the supplied vowels are to be pronounced short. 2 met, Mr. MARSDEN on, &c. 415 met, their prophet, from Mecca, in Arabia Petraea, to Medina, at that time called Yatreb, which was the thirteenth of his pretended mission, the year of Christ 622, and of the Julian period 5335. This event, but little memorable in itself, and deriving no celebrity from the circumstances immediately attending it, was, eighteen years after, distinguished by the Caliph OMAR, as the crisis of their new religion, and established as an epoch, to which the dates of all the transactions of the faithful should have reference in future (a) *. Previous to this, the people had been accustomed to compute from the commencement of a particular war, the day of a remarkable battle, or other occasional event of importance to their little communities (b). Accordingly, MAHOMET is said to have been born in the first year of the era of the Elephant, so called from an attack on the city and temple of Mecca, by a king of Abyssinian race, in which those animals were employed; and twenty years after this, the impious war, in which the animosity of two contending tribes occasioned them to violate the sacred or interdicted months, appeared of consequence sufficient to give rise to a new era. The uncertainty and confusion produced by this fluctuation demanded a reform, and more forcibly in proportion as the interests and concerns of the growing empire extended themselves. A dispute between two individuals, respecting the year in which the term of an obligation for money should be understood to expire (the parties being agreed as to the month), pointed out to the Caliph, to whose tribunal it was referred, the immediate necessity of enjoining the observance of a determinate era, in which the strongest prejudices of the people should be made to * See the authorities at the end, under this and the subsequent letters. concur 416 Mr. MARSDEN on the Era of concur with the sovereign authority. The date of the Hejera was thenceforth expressed in all the public acts and letters. It must be understood, that although the account of the years, collectively considered, was vague, that of the months was certain, and their succession at all times scrupulously attended to. OMAR did not think it expedient to attempt any innovation as to the time of beginning the year, against which the ideas of the people would have revolted; and therefore, although the escape of MAHOMET from the indignation of his fellow-citizens was effected, according to their records, on the first day of the third month, or Rabee prior (on the twelfth day of which he reached Medina), yet the Hejera takes date from a period two months antecedent to this flight, namely, from the first day of Moharram, being the day on which immemorial custom had established the celebration of the festival of the new year (c). The Arabian and Syrian Christians, and the Mahometan astronomers in general, appear to have fixed this day to Thursday the fifteenth of the Syro-Macedonian month Tamooz, answering to our July; but some among the latter, and most of their historical writers, refer it to the next day, Friday the sixteenth, and this latter date has, in modern times, obtained almost universal acceptance (d). A religious preference which Friday claims above the rest of the week, seems to have given effect to the arguments in its favour (e). The difference of opinion on this subject has arisen, in the first place, from the uncertainty unavoidably attending a date, to be ascertained, at a distant period of time, from the phase of the moon, which is retarded or advanced by so complicated a variety of circumstances (f): and the ambiguity appears, in the second place, to have been promoted by the custom of the Arabs the Mahometans, called the Hejera. 417 Arabs beginning their day at sun-set; conformably with which idea, the time when the moon became visible at Mecca, being the evening of Thursday the fifteenth, according to our mode of computation *, was to them the commencement of Friday; which Friday (beginning a few hours later) we term the sixteenth of July. At that period the cycle of the sun was 15; the cycle of the moon, or golden number, 15; the Roman indiction 10; and the dominical letter C. The year of the Mahometans consists of twelve lunar months, and no embolism being employed to adjust it to the solar period (as practised by the Chaldaeans and Hebrews, who were in other particulars their guides, and anciently, it is said, by the Arabs themselves), the commencement of each successive lunar year anticipates the completion of the solar, and revolves through all its seasons, the months respectively preserving no correspondence (g). In order to form a just and accurate idea of the length of this year, and of its component months, it will be necessary to distinguish two modes of estimating their commencement and duration. These, though their difference is not progressive (never amounting to more than two whole days, and rarely to so much as one), may yet, if misunderstood, occasion, in some instances, uncertainty and error: and more especially as the writers on this subject have inadvertently fallen * The new moon happened in July 622, on the 14th day, at 51/2 hours, A.M. Greenwich time, or about 8 hours Mecca time; and at sun-set of the same day, the moon was 51/4 degrees before the sun in longitude, and in 40 minutes south latitude, and therefore about 41/4 degrees above the horizon. On the 15th, at sun-set, it was 18 1/4 before the sun in longitude, in 37~ north latitude, and about 15~1/4 above the horizon, consequently visible with clear weather. The sun sets at Mecca, on the 15th July, at 6 h. 40~, and the twilight is there considerably shorter than in the high latitudes. into 418 Mr. MARSDEN on the Era of into contradictions, from neglecting to explain to their readers a distinction of which they must have been themselves sufficiently aware *. These modes may be denominated the vulgar or practical, and the political or chronological reckoning. The vulgar or practical reckoning is that which estimates the commencement of the year, or first day of the month Moharram, from the appearance of the new moon, on the evening of the first or second day after the conjunction, or from that time at which it might from its age be visible, if not obscured by the circumstances of the weather, which is scarcely ever so soon as twenty-four hours, and seldom later than forty-eight hours, after the actual change. This appearance is announced by persons placed on the pinnacles of the mosques or other elevated situations, to the people below, who welcome it with the sound of instruments, firing of guns, and other demonstrations of respect and zeal ~. The month thus commenced is computed to last till the new moon again becomes visible; and so of the remaining months, till she has completed her twelfth lunation, and, emerging from the sun's rays, marks the practical commencement of another year (h). In the political or chronological mode of reckoning, the return of a new year, or the duration of the months which compose it, is not regulated either by the appearance of the moon, or the calculated period of conjunction, but according to a certain division of a cycle of thirty years, adopted for this * The justice of this remark will appear evident by contrasting the authorities quoted under the letters (h) (i) and (m). ~ These salutations are more solemn or clamourous at the return of some months than of others, and particularly on the appearance which terminates the month of fasting, or Ramadan. purpose. the Mahometans, called the Hejera. 419 purpose *. Particular attention is due to the explanation of this mode, both as being more artificial and complex, and because it serves to regulate the dates in matters of historical record, and indeed of all writings where pretension is made to accuracy (k). Upon this the Turkish, Moorish, and every systematic Mahometan calendar are founded. The lunar month, or mean synodic revolution, according to the computation of the Arabian astronomers, consists of 29 days, 12 hours, and 792 scruples or parts in 1080; and the year of 354 days, 8 hours, and 864 scruples. But, as the purposes of mankind require that the year should contain an integral number of days, it became expedient to collect and dispose of these fractional exceedings in a consistent and practicable manner; and with this view, a cycle or period of thirty lunar years was chosen, as the lowest number that admitted of their being formed into days, without sensible deficiency or remainder. Their sum being 11 days, it was determined that 19 of those thirty years should be composed of 354 days, and 11 of 355 days each. The justness of this proportion will equally appear, if it be observed, that 8 hours and 864 scruples (or 48 minutes) constitute 11 parts in 30 of twenty-four hours, and consequently in thirty years produce an excess of 11 whole days ~. It remained next to be considered * A passage in ALFRAGANUS (who wrote about the year of Christ 950) would lead us to infer, that, beside the two ways of computing time here distinguished, the Astronomers were accustomed to follow a third, whose periods were marked by the conjunction of the luminaries: but, as this learned Mahometan was a professed student of PTOLEMY'S works (which in this place he quotes), we may conclude, that, when he speaks of astronomers, he does not mean to confine the expression to those of his own country or religion (i). ~ The mean synodic revolution being 29 d. 12 h. 44~ and nearly 3~, this cycle V O L. LXXVIII. K k k falls 420 Mr. MARSDEN on the Era of dered in what order and method these additional or intercalary days should be inserted, so as to effect the compensation required with as much equability as possible, and maintain a correspondence, as near as circumstances would admit, with the periods marked by the phases of the moon. The following are the years to which, for reasons that shall be afterwards assigned, it was judged proper to annex an extraordinary day, and which (in contradistinction to those 19 that have only 354 days) are termed years of excess, viz. the 2d, 5th, 7th, 10th, 13th, 16th, 18th, 21st, 24th, 26th, and 29th, of the cycle of thirty years. Their months, conformably with those of the Hebrew calendar, it was determined should consist alternately of 30 and 29 days; and therefore, in an ordinary or simple year of 354 days, the twelfth and last month, Dulhajee, would have only 29; but, in the years of excess, the intercalary day is added to this month, which is then made to consist of 30 days, and the year, consequently, of 355 days (m). Thus, for example, in the year of Christ 622, the Hejera commenced on the 16th of July, with the Arabian month Days. Days. Moharram, which had 30 Moharram, in the 2d year, had 30 Safar 29 Safar 29 Rabee prior 30 Rabee prior 30 Carried over 89 Carried over 89 falls short of thirty complete lunar years, by something more than 17, and consequently advances one day in about 2500 years. The Chaldaeans, who made the time of the revolution to consist of one scruple, or 1080th part of an hour, more than the Arabs thought fit to allow, were wonderfully near to the truth (l). If, instead of thirty years, a cycle of nineteen had been chosen, and seven days intercalated, there would have been an excess of a thirtieth part of a day, which would have caused the reckoning to retrograde one day in 570 years. Rabee the Mahometans, called the Hejera. 421 Days. Days.

Ended 25 June 624. It may not be uninteresting to examine the rule by which the Arabians appear to have been guided, in placing the intercalary day at the end of those particular years which have been specified. It was observed, that the annual excess is calculated to be 11 parts in 30 of a day. At the commencement of the first year of their first cycle, they appear to have assumed the fact (somewhat capriciously) that there was then an excess of 11 parts, belonging to the preceding year, to be accounted for, or brought on. At the end of the first year there would consequently be 22 such parts; and at the end of the second year 33 parts. Here then the first intercalary day was applied; that second year was made to consist of 355 days, and there remained 3 parts, over and above, to be carried on to the next. K k k 2 At 422 Mr. MARSDEN on the Era of At the expiration of the third year, the parts amounted to 14; of the fourth year, to 25; and of the fifth, to 36; when the intercalation was again applied, and a balance of 6 parts carried on. From this it will be understood in what manner the fractional exceedings of each year were combined and disposed of through the succeeding years of the cycle; and it will be necessary only further to remark, that, when the aggregate of the fractions falls short no more than 2 or 3 parts of the number of 30, they still add the intercalary day, and deduct the deficiency from the excess of the following year, which, in the course of one cycle, takes place only three times. At the end of the 29th year, the accumulated fractions, amounting exactly to 30, are commensurate with the intercalation then applied; and the excess of the 30th, or last year, is accounted for in the first intercalation of the succeeding period. The operation would doubtless have appeared more methodical, if the first intercalary day were not to have been added till the end of the third year, and the eleventh, or last, till the end of the 30th year or termination of the cycle. From this consideration some commentators have been led to dissent from the more general idea, as above given, and to suggest, that the embolism is in fact applied so soon after the commencement of the cycle, as the yearly accumulation of the fractional parts exceeds the sum of half a day, or twelve hours, and that it accordingly is made to take place at the end of the second year, because the fractions then amount to 17 h. 36~, or 22 parts in 30; at the end of the fifth year, because they then amount to 25; and at the end of the seventh year, to 17 parts; keeping thus as near as possible to the mean division of time, by applying the compensation before it is fully wanted. The effect, however, is in both cases the same, and the Mahometans, called the Hejera. 423 and it is of but little moment to determine which theory is right *. This cycle of thirty Mahometan years, contains 10,631 days, and is equal to 29 years and 39 days of our computation. The annual mean difference is 10 days and 21 hours nearly; which in common calculations, for short periods of time, may be reckoned at 11 days, by which number the lunar year anticipates the solar. Annexed hereto is a table exhibiting the correspondence of the years of the Hejera, from the establishment of that epoch, with those of the Christian era, to the year of our Lord 2000. Until the beginning of the present century, it appears sufficient to distinguish every tenth year; the intervals between which may be calculated with ease and precision, by attending to what has been said respecting the cycle. From the year 1700 to the conclusion of the twentieth century, for the convenience of historians yet unborn, the commencement of each year of the Hejera is ascertained. These tables are founded upon those of GRAVIUS (J. GREAVES), in his Epochae celebriores ULUG BEIGI, published in 1650; but as he, in conformity with the principles of this celebrated Tartarian astronomer ~, has fixed the epoch of the Hejera to the 15th July, * The former hypothesis is supported by CHRISTMANNUS (Commentarius ad caput primum ALFRAGANI, 1590), who quotes many ancient authorites. PETAVIUS (PETEAU) (de Doctrina Temporum, 1627) is inclined to give the preference to the latter, on the authority of PAULUS FOROSEMPRONIUS, and the probability of the matter (n). It does not appear at what time the use of this cycle was introduced, but probably subseqnent to the establishment of the era by OMAR, though he is said to have been assisted on that occasion by a learned Persian. ~ ULUG BEIG was the grandson of TIMUR the Great (TAMERLANE), to whose empire he succeeded on the death of his father SHAH RUKH. He was born in 1393, and died in 1449. instead 424 Mr. MARSDEN on the Era of instead of the 16th, or historical period, it was judged requisite to add one day, throughout, to his calculations. The propriety of this alteration is strengthened by the authority of other chronologists *, and by the practice of the modern almanacs ~. It is also to be observed, that the tables of GRAVIUS, having been composed in the seventeenth century, are calculated both for past and future time, according to the old style; and as the change took place, in England, in September of the year 1752, it was necessary to adjust all the succeeding years to the new calendar. In order that a judgment may be formed of the correspondence of the annual periods shewn by these tables, founded on the cycle of thirty years, which is adjusted to the mean motion of the moon, with those marked by the appearance of that planet, a short table is subjoined, containing a comparison of the results of the two modes of reckoning, during one cycle, commencing with the year of the Hejera 1171 (p). * See Tables of the Hejera in RICCIOLI, Chronologia Reformata, 1659. Ephemerides MAT. FRED. BECKII, 1695 (o). ~ According to the original tables of GREAVES, the first day of Moharram, in the year of CHRIST 1783, falls on the 14th November, O.S., or 25th November, N.S.; and in 1784, on the 2d November, O.S., or 13th November, N.S.; whereas, by two almanacs, printed at Calcutta in Bengal, it appears, that the days should be the 26th and 14th November. Of these almanacs, the one was compiled in the `` Office of the Mission;'' and the other by an ingenious astronomer from England; and both founded on the usage of the Mahometans of India.
