C 164 J XIII. Hydwaulic Investigations, subservient to an intended Croon7an Lecture on the Afotion of the Blood. By Thomas Young, M4 D. For. Sec. R. S. Read May 5, i808. I. Of the Friction and Discharge of Fluids running in Pipes, and of the Velocity of Rivers. HAVING lately fixed on the discussion of the nature of inflammation, for the subject of an academical exercise, I found it necessary to examine attentively the mechanical principles of the circulation of the blood, and to investigate minutely and comprehensively the motion of fluids in pipes, as affected by friction, the resistance occasioned by flexure, the laws of the propagation of an impulse through the fluid contained in an elastic tube, the magnitude of a pulsation in different parts of a conical vessel, and the effect of a contraction advancing progressively through the length of a given canal. The physiological application of the results of these inquiries I shall have the honour of laying before the Royal Society at a future time ; but I have thought it advisable to communicate, in a separate paper, such conclusions, as may be interesting to some persons, who do not concern themselves with disqui. sitions of a physiological nature; and I imagine it may be as agreeable to the Society that they should be submitted at present to their consideration, as that they should be withheld until the time appointed for the delivery of the Croonian Lecture. It has been observed by the late Professor ROBISON, that the comparison of the Chevalier DUBUAT'S calculations with Dr. YOUNG'S Hydraulic Investigattions. 65 his experiments is in all respects extremnely satisfactory that it exhibits a beautiful specimen of the means of expressing the genteral result of an -extensive series of observations in ananalytical formula, and that it does honour ,to the penetration, skill, and address of Mr. DUBUAT, and 'of Mr. DE ST. HONORE', who assisted him in the construction of his expressions. I am by no means disposed to dissent from this encomium; and I agree with Professor RoBISON, and with all other late authors on hydraulics, in: applauding uhe unusually accurate coincidence between these theorems and the experiments "from which they were deduced. But I have already taken lthe liberty of remarking, in my lecture on the history ofhydraulics, that theformofthese expressions is by no means sot convenient,-for practice as it might have been rendered; and they are also liable. to. still greater objections in particular cases-, -sinee, when the--pipe: is, either extremely narrow, or, Wextremely -lonlg,;they::become completely erroneous: for notwithstanding Mr. D UBUAT seems to be of opinion, that', a canal -may have a. finite inclination, and yet thewater contaned' in' it may remain perfectly at rest, and that no force can, be sufficient to,.make water flow in anv finite, quantity through a' tube less than one twenty-fifth of an inch in diameter, it can scarcely require an argument to show that he is-mmistaken, in both these respects. It was therefore necess-ary for ny purpose to substitute, for the formulw of Mr. DUBUAT, others of.:aitotally different nature.;, and I could follow DuBUAT, in nothing but in his general mode of considierfig a part of thlle pressure, or. of the height of a given reservoir, as employed in overcoming the friction. of. the pipe through which the water flows. out of it; a principle, hich, if not of lhis o-riginzal-in-vention, was certainly firsto reduced by.. him into a. 166 Dr. YOUNG'S Hydraulic Investigations. practical form. By comparing the experiments, which he has collected, with some of GERSTNER, and some of my own, I have ultimately discovered a formula, which appears to agree fully as well as DUBUAT'S, with the experiments fronm which his rules were deduced, which accords better with GERSTNER'S experiments,which extends to all the extreme cases with equal accuracy, which seems to represent more simply the actual operation of the forces concerned, and which is direct in its application to practice, without the necessity of any successive approximations. I began by examining the velocities of the water,discharged, through pipes of a given diameter, with different degrees of pressure; and I found that the friction could not be represented by any single power of the velocity, although it frequently approached to the proportion of that power, of which the exponent is 1.8; but that it appeared to consist of two parts, the one varying simply as the velocity, the other as its square. The proportion of these parts to each other must however be considered as different, in pipes of different diameters, the first part being less perceptible in very large pipes, or in rivers, but becoming greater than the second in very minute tubes, while the second also becomes greater, for each given portion of the internal surface of the pipe, as the diameter is diminished. If we express, in the first place, all the measures in French inches, calling the height employed in overcoming the friction f, the velocity in a second v, the diameter of the pipe d, and its length 1, we may make f = a v + 2 C v; for it is obvious that the friction must be directly as the length of the pipe; and since the pressure is proportional to the area of the section, and the surface producing the friction to its circumfeDr. YOUN G'S HydraulAc Investzgations. 167 rence or diameter, the relative magnitude of the friction must also be inversely as the diameter, or nearly so, as DUBUAT has justly observed. We shall then find that a must be .oooooi 3 + 1440 ISO I 9Z0gId I 4f30 + and c .00ooooo |dd 1000 + ( (1 o5o + Id + j)9). Hence it is easy to calculate the velocity for any given pipe or river, and with any given head of water. For the height required for producing the velocity, independently of friction, is, according to DUBUAT, Tor rather, as it appears from almost all the experiments which I have comnpared, 2; and the whole height h is therefore equal tof + 2 550 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~5505 or h= al +Ijv2, + 2C ;ad aigband Ad 550ffi 7 v--cvalmkn at: d+ .001 82 e = -i-d X + 2eV =bh, whence v = (bh + e') e. In order to adapt this formula to the case of rivers, we must make I infinite; then b becomes d and bh d ds being the sine of the inclination, and d four times the hydraulic c V (a(s + cc) c mean depth ; and since e is here -= v = a -C and in most rivers, v becomes nearly V( 2oooo ds). In order to show the acremnient of these formula wvith ahe result of observation, I have extracted, as indiscrirninately and impartially as possible, forty of the experiments made and collected by DUBUAT; I have added to these some of GERSTNER'S, with a few of My own; and I have compared the re.sults of these experiments with DUBUAT'S calculations, and with my own formulw, in separate columns. There are six of DUBUAT'S experiments which he has rejected as irregular, apparently without any very sufficient reason, since he has accide1tlv nmentioned that some of them were made With great calre: I have therefore calculated the velocities for these exnerilnents in both welays, and compared the results in a separate table. -168 IDr. YOUNG'S Hydraulic Invesmigr zons.

I.z) It appears from this comparison, that i n the forty experiments extracted from the collection, which served a' a basis for DUBUAT'S calculations, the mean error of his formula is r of the whole velocity, and that of mine l yny,; but if we omit the four experiments, in which the superficial velocity only of a river was observed, and in which I have calculated the mnean velocity by DUBIYAT'S rules, the mean MIDCCcVIlI Z 170 dDr. YOUNG'S Hydraulic Investigations. error of the remaining 36 is 3 according to my mode of calculation, and -jaccording to Mr. DUBUAT'S; So that on the whole, the accuracy of the two formulae may be considered as precisely equal with respect to these experiments. In the six experiments which DUBUAT has wholly rejected, the mean error of his formula is about 2-, and that of mine 4 In fifteen of GERSTNER'S experiments, the mean error of DUBUAT'S rule is one third, that of mine one fourth; and in the three experiments which I made with very fine tubes, the error of my own rules is one fifteenth of the whole, while in such cases DUBUAT'S formule completely fail. I have determined the mean error by adding together the logarithmic ratios of all the results, and dividing the sum by the number of experiments. It would be useless to seek for a much greater degree of accuracy, unless it were probable that the errors of the experiments themselves were less than those of the calculations; but if a sufficient number of extremely accurate and frequently repeated experiments could be obtained, it would be very possible to adapt my formula still more correctly to their results. In order to facilitate the computation, I have made a table of the coefficients a and c for the different values of d, all the measures being still expressed in French inches.

I had at first employed for a the formula 430 + 5 + but I found that the value, thus determined, became too great when d was about 20, and too small in some other cases. COULOMB's experiments on the friction of fluids, made by means of the torsion of wires, give about .00014 for the value of c, which agrees as nearly with this table, as any constant number could be expected to do. I have however reason to think, from some experiments communicated to me by Mr. ROBERTSON BUCHANAN, that the value of a, for pipes about half an inch in diameter, is somewhat too small; my mode of calculation, as well as DUBUAT'S, giving too great a velocity in such cases. If any person should be desirous of making use of DiTBUAT'S formula, it would still be a great convenience to begin Z sp Dr. YOUNG'S Hydraulic Investigations. by determining v according to this method; then, taking b-Jv +78, or rather, as LANGSDOBF makes it, b = vzl ldv2:47 8' .V"48 to proceed in calculating v by the formula v = 148.5 ( Vd ~). K ( s H.-L.Vab + i.6) -. oo), since this determination of b will, in general, be far more accurate than the simple expression b = ' + 45d, and the continued repetition of bI, the calculation, with approximate values of v, may thus be avoided. Sometimes, indeed, the values of v found by this repetition, will constitute a diverging instead of a converging series, and in such cases, we can only employ a conjectural value of v, intermediate between the two preceding ones. Having sufficiently examined the accuracy of my formula, I shall now reduce it into English inches, and shall add a second table of the coefficients, for assisting the calculation. In this case, a becomes .0000001 (413 + 75 -d 1440 I8s d d+ iz,8 d+.3551 c = .ooo??lg(odd+l + Ie' ( 1082) + an b d =.0000001 9ood d(~ 3I 1.056 e bein b l and v = V(bh+ e2) -e, or ,RI: d + .00171' in d v( + cc +,as before; and in either case the superficial velocity of a river may be found, very nearly, by adding to the mean velocity v its square root, and the velocity at the bottom by subtracting it.

Of the Resistance occasioned by Flexure in Pipes or Rivers. Mr. DUBUAT has made some experiments on the effect of the flexure of a pipe in retarding the motion of the water flowing through it ; but they do not appear to be by any means sufficient to authorise the conclusions which he has drawn from them. He directs the squares of the sines of the angles of flexure to be collected into one sum, which, being multiplied by a certain constant coefficient, and by the square of the velocity, is to show the height required for overcoming the resistance. It is, however, easy to see that such a rule must be fundamentally erroneous, and its coincidence with some experiments merely accidental, since the results afforded by it must vary according to the method of stating the problem, which is entirely arbitrary. Thus it depended only on Mr. DUBUAT to consider a pipe bent to an angle of 140o as C011sisting of a single flexure, as composed of two flexures of 720 each, or of a much greater number of smaller flexures, although the result of the experiment would only agree with 174 Dr. YOUNG'S Hydraulic Investigations. the arbitrary division into two parts, which he has adopted. This difficulty is attached to every mode of computing the effect either from the squares of the sines or from the sines themselves; and the only way of avoiding it is to attend merely to the angle of flexure as expressed in degrees. It is natural to suppose that the effect of the curvature must increase, as the curvature itself increases, and that the retardation must be inversely proportional to the radius of curvature, or very nearly so; and this supposition is sufficiently confirmed, by the experiments, which Mr. DUBUAT has employed in support of a theory so diflerent. It might be expected that an equal curvature would create a greater resistance in a larger pipe than in a smaller, since the inequality in the motions of the different parts of the fluid is greaterbut this circumstance does not seem to have influenced the results of the experiments made with pipes of an inch and of two inches diameter: there must also be some deviation from the general law, in cases of very small pipes having a great curvature, but this deviation cannot be determined without further experiments. Of the i which DUBUAT has made, he has rejected 10 as irregular, because they do not agree with his theory: indeed 4 of them, which were made with a much shorter pipe than the rest, differ so manifestly from them that they cannot be reconciled: but S others agree sufficiently, as well as all the rest, with the theory which I have here proposed, supposing the resistance to be as the angular flexure, and to increase besides almost in the same proportion as the radius of curvature diminishes, but more nearly as that power of the radius of which the index is -i. Thus if p be the number of degrees subtended at the centre of Dr. YouNG's Hydraulic Investigations. 175 flexure, and q the radius of curvature of the axis of the pipe in French inches, we shall have r pv nearly, or, more i2OOooq .000004Spvt8 accurately, r = These calculations are comparq ed with the whole of DUBUAT's experiments in the following table.

Of the Propagation of an Impulse through an elastic Tube. The same reasoning, that is employed for determining the velocity of an impulse, transmitted through an elastic solid or fluid body, is also applicable to the case of an incompressible fluid contained in an elastic pipe; the magnitude of the modulus being properly determined, according to the excess of pressure which any additional tension of the pipe is capable of producing; its height being such, as to produce a tension, which is to any small increase of tension produced by the approach of twvo sections of the fluid in the pipe, as their distance to its decrement: for in this case the forces concerned are precisely similar to those which are employed in the transmission of an impulse through a column of air enclosed in a tube, or through an elastic solid. If the nature of the pipe be such, that its elastic force varies as the excess of its circumference or diameter above the natural extent, which is nearly the usual constitution of elastic bodies, it may be shown that there is a certain finite height which will cause an infinite extension, and that the height of the modulus of elasticity, fob each point, is equal to half its height above the base of this imaginary column; which may therefore be called with propriety the modular column of the pipe: consequently the velocity of an impulse will be at every point equal to half of that which is due to the height of the point above the base; and the velocity of an impulse ascending through the pipe being every where half as great as that of a body falling through the corresponding point in the modular column, the whole time of ascent will be precisely twice as great as that of the descent of the Dr. YOUNG'S Hydraulic Investigations. 177 falling body ; and in the same manner if the pipe be inclined, the motion of the impulse may be compared with that of a body descending or ascending freely along an inclined plane. These propositions may be thus demonstrated: let a be the diameter of the pipe in its most natural state, and let this diameter be increased to b by the pressure of the column c, the tube being so constituted that the tension may vary as the force. Then the relative force of the column c is represented by bc, since its efficacy increases, according to the laws of hydrostatics, in the ratio of the diameter of the tube ; and this force must be equal, in a state of equilibrium, to the tension arising fromr the change from a to b, that is, to b _ a; consequently the height c varies as b-a; and if the tube be enlarged to any diameter x, the corresponding pressure required to distend it will be expressed by a height of the column equal a bc ~b-a X-aa b to (I _. b-a, since -: C :: X : (I a} b Now if the diameter be enlarged in such a degree, that the length of a certain portion of its contents may be contracted in the ratio 1 : 1 -r, r being very small, then the enlargement will be in the ratioi:1+ jthat is, x will be ; but the increisax' be ment of the force, or of the height, is a. i-, which will become ar bc Now in a tube filled with an elastic fluid, 2Xb-d the height being b, the force in similar circumstances would be rb, and if we make hIi a bc the velocity of the prozx b-a' pagation of an impulse will be the same in bothcases, and MDCCCVIII.

The demonstrations of EULER, LAGRANGE, and BERNOULLI, respecting the propagation of sound, have determined that the ve-locity of the actual motion of the individual particles of an elastic fluid, when an impulse is transmitted through a Dr.-YOUNG'S Hydraulic Investigations. 179 conical pipe, or diverges spherically from a centre, varies in the simple inverse ratio of the distance from the vertex or centre, or in the inverse subduplicate ratio of the number of particles affected, as might naturally be inferred from the general law of the preservation of the ascending force or impetus, in all cases of the communication of motion between elastic bodies, or the particles of fluids of any kind. There is also another way of considering the subject, by which a similar conclusion may be formed respecting waves diverging from or converging to a centre. Suppose a straight wave to bereflected backwards and forwards in succession, by two vertical surfaces, perpendicular to the direction of its motion it is evident that in this and every other case of such reflections, the pressure against the opposite surfaces must be equ3al, otherwise the centre of inertia of the' whole system of bodies concerned would be displaced by their mutual actions, which is contrary to the general laws of the properties of the centre of inertia. Now if, instead of one of the surfaces, we substitute two others, converging in a very acute angle, the wave will be elevated higher and higher as it approaches the angle: and if its height be supposed to be every where in the inverse subduplicate ratio of the distance of the converging surfaces, the magnitude of the pressure, reduced to the direction of the motion, will be precisely equal to that of the pressure on the single opposite surface, which will not happen if the elevation vary inversely in the simple ratio of the distance, or in that of any other powver than its square root. This mode of considering the subject affords us therefore an additional reason for asserting, that in all Aa 2 18O Dr. YOUNG'S Hydraulic Investigations. transmissions of impulses through elastic bodies, or through gravitating fluids, the intensity of the impulse varies inversely in the subduplicate ratio of the extent of the parts affected at the same time; and the same reasoning may without doubt be applied to the case of an elastic tube. There is however a very singular exception, in the case of waves crossing each other, to the general law of the preservation of ascending force, which appears to be almost sufficient to set aside the universal application of this law to the motions of fluids. It is confessedly demonstrable that each of two waves, crossing each other in any direction, will preserve its motion and its elevation with respect to the surface of the fluid affected by the other wave, in the same manner as if that surface were plane: and, when the waves cross each other nearly in the same direction, both the height and the actual velocity of the particles being doubled, it is obvious that the ascending force or impetus is also doubled, since the bulk of the matter concerned is only halved, while the square of the velocity is quadrupled; and supposing the double wave to be stopped by an obstacle, its magnitude, at the moment of the greatest elevation, will be twice as great as that of a single. wave in similar circumstances, and the height, as well as the quantity of matter, will be doubled, so that either the actual or the potential height of the centre of gravity of the fluid seems to be essentially altered, whenever such an interference of waves takes place. This difficulty deserves the attentive consideration of those who shall attempt to investigate either the most refined parts of hydraulics, or the metaphysical principles of the laws of motion. % Dr. YOUNG'S Hydraulic Investigations. 18i V. Of the Effect of a Contraction, advancing through a Canal. IF we suppose the end of a rectangular horizontal canal, partly filled with water-, to advance with a given velocity, less than that with which a wave naturally moves on the surface of the water, it may be shown that a certain portion of the water will be carried forwards, witha surface nearly horizontal, and that the extent of this portion will be determined, very nearly, by the difference of the spaces described, in any given time, by a wave, moving on the surface thus elevated, and by the moveable end of the canal. The form of the anterior terminationr of this elevated portion, orwave, may vary, according to the degrees by which the motion may be supposed to have commenced; but whatever this form may be, it will cause an accelerative force, which is sufficient to impart suc-cessively to the portions of the fluid, along which it passes, a velocity equal to that of the moveable end, so that the elevated surface of the parts in motion may remain nearly horizontal: and this proposition will be the more accurately true, the smaller the velocity of the moveable end may be. For, calling this velocity v, the original depth a, the increased depth x, and the velocity of the anterior part of the wave y, we have, on the supposition that the extent of the wave is already become considerable, x = L , taking the negative or positive sign according to the direction of the motion, of the end; since the quantity of fluid, which before occupied. a length expressed by y, now occupies the length, + va and putting a _ x = As z _y av . The direction: y~v and pttin 182 Dr. YOUNG'S Hydraulic Investigations. of the surface of the margin of the wave is indifferent to the-calculation, and it is moSt convenient to suppose its inclination equal to half a right angle, so that the accelerating force, acting on any thin transverse vertical lamina, may be equal to its weight: then the velocity y must be such, that while the inclined margin of the wave passes by each lamina, the lamina may acquire the velocity v by a force equal to its own weight; consequently the time of its passage must be equal to that in which a body acquires the velocity v, in falling through a height b, corresponding to that velocity: and this time is expressed by T2b ; but the space described by the margin of the wave is not exactly z, because the lamina in question has moved horizontally during its acceleration, through a space which must be equal to b; the distance actually described will therefore be z + b, and we have Z + b ~z~b~av~y b~k21Tbys#v v -z + b av + by -2bv + by, y + y -t2 s (y + ) 2 + but, m being the proper coeffi-cient, v -m t/ b, and vy = m(,b am + 1 Y m'b, + im6 k i6 mi/ (a+ +) v andyTv=m1 2 + L6) + 4zX. BUtwhen v is small, we may takey + v nearly m a m a) = / j(ab), and x = a + V/ (2ab), while the height of a fluid, in which the velocity would be y, is nearly a + 3/ (2ab): consequently, when the velocity v is at all considerable,y must. be somewhat greater than the velocity of a wave moving on the surface of the elevated fluid; and probably the surface of the elevated portion will not in this case be perfectly horiDr. YOUNG'S Hydraulic Investigations. I 83 zontal; but where v is small, y may be taken, without material error, m v .r, or even m a/ V', which is the velocity of every small wave. The coefficient m is here assumed the same for the motion of a wave, as for the discharge through an aperture, and I have reason from observation to think this estimation sufficiently correct. Supposing now the moveable end of the canal to remain open at the lower part as far as the height c, then the excess of pressure, occasioned by the elevation before it, and the de-' pression behind, will cause the fluid, immediately below the moveable plane, to flow backwards, with the velocity determined by the height, which is the difference between the le-' vels; and the quantity thus flowing back, together with that which is contained in the moveable elevation, must be equal to the whole quantity displaced. But the depression, behind the moveable body, must vary according to the circumstances of the canal, whether it be supposed to end abruptly at the part from which the motion begins, or to be continued backwards without limit: in the first case, the elevation z will be to the depression as v to y v, the length of the same portion of the fluid being varied inversely in that ratio; in the second case, the proportion will be as y + v to y v: and the difference of the levels will be z + z = -, or secondly z+z Y -~-+-;and first, m a/ ZY c + (y -v) z = (a-c) Y?+V Yi-jV V v; but, since y is here considered as equal to mn v a, putting V i 2At/ b d,' y vJ d, and, calling a _ c, e, m, j/_ ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ c + mdz = me i/ b, ^/ L4' c + dzA e j/ b, cA -L b + d'z V V !z-dze V b, z' -" 2e V1)\ e2b +nclln ~ 184 Dr. YOUNG'S Hydraulic Investigations. zf, z =f _ (f 2) and in the same mannerf is found, for the second case, equal to d' cY + e V/ b For example, d~Y + v) d suppose the height a 2 feet, b , C -1, and consequently e = 1, then d becomes a, v = 4, and y = 8 ; and in the first case z .1, and in the second z =.14 If v, the velocity of the obstacle, were great in comparison withmVa, the velocity of a wave, and the space c below the obstacle were small, the anterior part of the elevation would advance with a velocity considerably greater than thie natural velocity of the wave: but if the space below the obstacle bore a considerable proportion to the whole height, the elevation z would be very small, since a moderate pressure would cause the fluid to flow back, with a sufficient velocity, to exhaust the greatest part of the accumulation, which would otherwise take place. Hence the elevation must always be less than that which is determined by the equation m V/ zc e, and z is at most equal to (ee) / = _ b; butsince the velocity of the anterior margin of the wave can never materially exceed v X especially when z is small, and v 2 being in this case nearly V1 + 1C bXmV . 2-mVb 2 (2V(a)cz 2 m ( av + b _ i/ b) which, multiplied by z, shows the utmost quantity of the fluid that can be supposed to be carried before the obstacle, Supposing b = 2 a, this quana e4 a i tity becomes m V a .e . ; and if be, for example, C4 4 ~~~C At x it will be expressed by av, while the whole quantity of the fluid left behind. Dr. YOUNG'S Hydraulic Investigations. 1 S5 A similar mode of reasoning may be applied to other cases of the propagation of impulses, in particular to that of a contraction moving along an elastic pipe. In this case, an increase of the diameter does not increase the velocity of the transmission of an impulse; and when the velocity of the contraction approaches to the natural velocity of an impulse, the quantity of fluid protruded must, if possible, be still smaller than in an open canal; that is, it must be absolutely inconsiderable, unless the contraction be very great in comparison with the diameter of the pipe, even if its extent be such as to occasion a friction which may materially impede the retrograde motion of the fluid. The application of this theory to the motion of the blood in the arteries is very obvious, and I shall enlarge more on the subject when I have the honour of laying before the Society the Croonian Lecture for the present year. The resistance, opposed to the motion of a floating body, might in some cases be calculated in a similar manner: but the principal part of this resistance appears to be usually derived from, a cause which is here neglected; that is, the force required to produce the ascending, descending, or lateral motions of the particles, which are turned aside to make way for the moving body; while in this calculation their direct and retrograde motions only are considered. The same mode of considering the motion of a vertical lamina may also be employed for determining the velocity of a wave of finite magnitude. Let the depth of *the fluid be a, and suppose the section of the wave to be an isosceles triangle, of which the height is b, and half the breadth c : then the force urging any thin vertical lamina MDCCCVIII.
