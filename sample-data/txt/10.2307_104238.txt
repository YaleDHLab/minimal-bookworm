VII. Extract of a Letter from John Rutty, M. D. to Dr. Mortimer, Secr. R. S. concerning the Poison of Laurel-Water. Dear Doctor, Dublin, May 17. 1732. I Received thine of Feb. 15. with the Transactions No 418 and 420. giving an Account of the Experiments upon Laurel-Water. I wish your Experiments [64] ments with the Milk, had more fully determin'd and ascertain'd it to be an Antidote, than they have yet done. I am informed by Dr. that <inferred>some</inferred> Apothecaries in England, being used to <inferred>sophisticate</inferred> BlackCherry-Water with Laurel-Leaves, will not be persuaded, that this is a Poison on human Bodies, notwithstanding our few Instances. I can now confirm that it really is so by this Story, which thou mayst be assured of the Truth of. At Lisminy in Westmeath, a Girl of 18 Years old, very well and healthy, took a Quantity, less than two Spoonfuls, of the first Runnings of the Simple Water of Laurel-Leaves; whereupon within half a Minute she fell down, was convulsed, foamed at the Mouth, and died in a short time, nor was there any Swelling on her Body. Printed for T. W O O D W A R D, at the Half-Moon, between the Two Temple-Gates in Fleetstreet; and C. DAVIS, the Corner of Pater noster-row, next Warwick-lane; P R I N T E R S to the R O Y A L S O C I E T Y. M. DCC. XLII. N. B. The Philosophical Transactions being three Years behindhand in regard of Time, we shall skip over 10 Numbers, and commence the Transactions for the current Year 1742. and the XLIId Volume with No 462. and so continue to publish the Papers for the future in the precise Order of the Times of their being read before the Royal Society; in the mean time this XLIst Volume, or the Transactions from No 452. to 462. shall be filled up with all possible Speed.
