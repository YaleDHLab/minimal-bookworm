C 319 ] XVIII. On the Pormuiw investigated by -Dr. BRINKLEY for the general Term in the Development of LAGRANGE'S ExPression for the Summation of Series and for successive Integrations. By Sir J. F. W. HERSCHEL, Bart., F.B.S. &c. Received April 26,-Read June 14, 1860. IN the Transactions of the Royal Society for 1807, Dr. BRINKLEY has investigated the general value of the coefficient of any term in the development of the function e and his result is remarkable for the mode of its expression in terms of the successive differences of the powers of zero, or of the numbers comprised in the general expression Amon. Since that time, in my paper published in the Transactions of the Society for 1815, " On the Development of Exponential Functions," I have exhibited other, and much more simple as well as more easily calculable expressions for the same coefficient, by means of the same useful and valuable differences, and in that and other subsequent memoirs, have extended their application to a variety of interesting inquiries in the theory of differences and series. It is singular, however, that up to the present time it has never been shown that the formulae of Dr. BRINKLEY, and my own, though affording in all cases coincident numerical results, are analytically reconcileable with each other; nor indeed is it at all easy to see either from the course of his investigation, which turns upon an intricate application of the combinatory analysis, or from the nature of the formula itself, how it is possible to pass from the one form of expression to the other so as to show their identity. This is what I now propose. Referring to my "' Collection of Examples in the Calculus of Finite Differences*," will be found the following relation, which enables us to pass from the differences of any one power of zero, as 0, to those of any other, as 0 x+n, viz.log (I + )}I.(A0x(1) .... (x-n+ 1).f (A)O-8 or changing x into x+n, {log (I + A:)}2.f(A)Ox+n=(xc+l)(x+2).... (x+n) .f (Z)O.

Now we have x(n (x+n)(x+n-1) (j_,)X~~jI 1 1.2 )V 2, &C.; and therefore, putting Sn for the sum of the n first terms of this series, F[ + n] 1 [x +n] 1 (1 i)v), Sn+1= I)n i[ 13 Vnn1 --ma Vg nn2 +2 +&c.} and consequently d )'(i _-v)x+_n-s+ _ }_ _ [+n] 2.3..._v,_ &c. whence it appears that [n-l]= IY [ dV)' { VIS } Dr. BRINKLEY'S expression is therefore now divested of its form in which successive different powers of Ox occur, and reduced to one in which, according to the spirit of the algorithm adopted in my system, successive powers of A, or of some functions of A* Philosophical Transactions, 1807, p. 125.

Now as regards the term (i-v), it is obvious that it will take when developed the form i~t .{oc+PA+rA2+ &c. }, and therefore, that when differentiated n -I times successively with respect to A, it will have the form Acl{P+3A+y'A2+ &c.}, so that, when applied as an operative symbol to Ox, the result will be =0.

CAYLEY'S NOTE ON THiE FOREGOING PAPER. Now V-0x, or (log 0 + A)) 0, is equal to [x] X coef. tf in () , and so V or ( 1og~i+L~))0 0is equal to [x] Xcoef. tin e Vlog (1e+1A) Hence, putting IR= t, the last-mentioned formula will be true if, as regards the term which contains to, we have __a7{ 1 1 R o_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ [n1] | 0] [x]n [1] [ -1] ( + 1) 11+[2] [x-2] (n 42) em ?. the series on the right-hand side being continued up to the term in Rx. This formula is, in fact, true if R, instead of being restricted to denotet denotes any function whatever of the form 1+6t+ct2+&8c., and it is true not only for the term in t', but for all the powers of t not higher than tx. And, moreover, R`n may denote any positive or negative integral or fractional power of R. In fact, the formula (assuming for a moment the truth of it) shows that the expansion of any power whatever of a series of the form in question, can be obtained by means of the expansions of the successive positive integer powers of the same series: the existence of such a formula (at least for negative powers) was indicated by EISENSTEIN, Crelle, t. xxxix. p. 181 (1850), and the formula itself, in a slightly different form, was obtained in a very simple manner by Professor SYLVESTER in his paper, " Development of an idea of EISENSTEIN," Quart. Math. Journ. t. i. p. 199 (1855); the demonstration was in fact as follows, viz. writing ]Et 1R-)'&l (-) l (R1)2 +&C.. if we attend only to the terms involving powers of t not higher than tV, the series on the right-hand side need only be continued up to the term involving (R1)X and the right side being thus converted into a rational and integral function of R, it may be developed in a series of powers of R (the highest power being of course WR), and the coefficients of the several powers are finite series which admit of summation; this gives the required formula. But there is an easier method; the process shows that the series on the righthand side, continued as above up to the term involving tx, is, as regards n, a rational and integral function of the degree x; and by LAGRANGE'S interpolation formula, any rational and integral function of n of the degree x, can be at once expressed in terms of the values corresponding to ( + 1) particular values of n. The investigation will be as follows :-Let R denote a series of the form 1 + bt+et2+&c. and let R' denote the development of the nth power of R, continued up to the term containing A, the terms involving higher powers of t being rejected. R2, R', P2, &c., and generally RW, will in like manner denote the developments of these powers up to the term involving tX, or what is the same thing, they will be the values of RE, corresponding to n=0, 1, 2,..s. By what precedes RX is a rational and integral function of in of the degree x, and it can therefore be expressed in terms of the values M, li' l2, . .. 1W, which correspond to n=, 1, 2,-. MR.
