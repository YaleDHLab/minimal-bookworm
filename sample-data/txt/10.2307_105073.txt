[360] LIX. [361] The Portraiture of an uncommon Child, born January 1752, of the Wife of Richard Tong, of Hebus near Middleton, 5 Miles from Manchester in the County of Lancaster. The child, or children, if they may be so called, are both females. The one is a perfect healthylooked fine girl. The imperfect one adheres to the perfect one by the cartilago ensiformis, by a cartilaginous substance 4 inches in circumference. The body seems to be of a soft fleshy substance of very little regularity: it has no head, nor neck, nor any respiration: out of the upper parts of its body come out two short arms. On the right, which is the longer, are 4 fingers, but no thumb on the left, which is very short, its hand is very deficient, and upon it only two fingers. The thighs, legs, and feet, are the most perfect, tho' the legs have only one bone in them. It has no vertebrae of the back or Z z loins [362] loins. The os sacrum, as well as the os pubis, imperfectly ossified. All its joints are very rigid and stiff. It has no anus, but passes off its water in the natural way. Its sternum is very imperfect; and it has no clavicula. It seems insensible of pain, not removing its arms or legs, if laid in an uneasy posture.
