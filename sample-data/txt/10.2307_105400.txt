A new Method of computing the Sums of certain Series; by Mr. John Landen: Communicated by Mr. Thomas Simpson, F. R. S. A S the improving the analytic art, especially any branch of it that relates to the summation of series, may, by facilitating computations, conduce to the improvement of several branches of science; it is presumed, that this paper, which exhibits a new and easy method of computing the sums of a great number of infinite series, may be acceptable to the mathematical world, and deemed worthy to be inserted in the British Philosophical Transactions. 1. Supposing x to be the sine of the circular arc z, whose radius is 1, x/~ 1 x2 will be = z; and, consequently, x/~ x2 1 = z/~ 1. From whence, by taking the correct fluents, we have hyp. log. x + ~ x2 1/~ 1 = z/~ 1. Hence, Read Feb. 28, 1760. [554] Hence, writing a for one fourth of the periphery of the circle whose radius is 1, and taking x equal to the said radius, we find hyp. log. 1/~ 1 = a/~ 1; and, consequently, hyp. log. ~ 1 = a/~ 1, and hyp. log. 1 = ~ 2 a/~ 1. 2. The hyp. log. of 1/1 x being = x + x2/2 + x3/3 + x4/4, &c. FI = fluent of x/x hyp. log. 1/1 x, is = x + x2/22 + x~/3~ + x4/42, &c. FII = fluent of x/x FI = x + x2/23 + x3/33 + x4/43, &c. FIII = fluent of x/x FII = x + x2/24 + x3/34 + x4/44, &c. FIV = fluent of x/x FIII = x + x2/25 + x3/35 + x4/45, &c. &c. &c. &c. 3. By writing, in the first equation in the preceding article, 1/x instead of x, we have Hyp. log. 1/1 1/x = x 1 + x-2/2 + x-3/3, &c. But the hyp. log. of 1/1 1/x is = hyp. log. x/x 1 = hyp. [555] hyp. log. 1/1 x + hyp. log. x + hyp. log. 1 = ~ 2 b + X + hyp. log. 1/1 x, b being put for a/~ 1, and X for the hyp. log. of x. It is evident, therefore, that Hyp. log. 1/1 x is = ~ 2 b X + x 1 + x 2/2 + x 3/3, &c. where, of the two signs prefixed to 2 b, the upper one takes place, when the hyp. log. of 1 is taken equal to 2 a/~ 1, likewise when x is taken equal to ~ 1; and the lower one takes place, when the hyp. log. of 1 is taken equal to 2 a/~ 1, also when x is taken equal to 1/~ 1: wherefore, if we observe to take the value of hyp. log. of 1, as last mentioned, and x equal to 1/~ 1, instead of ~ 1, we need retain only the lower of the said signs. 4. For brevity sake, we shall, in what follows, put the series 1 + 1/22 + 1/32 + 1/42, &c. = PII, 1 + 1/24 + 1/34 + 1/44, &c. = PIV, 1 + 1/26 + 1/36 + 1/46, &c. = PVI, &c. &c. 1 + 1/32 + 1/52 + 1/72, &c. = QII V O L. LI. 4 C 1 [556] 1 1/3~ + 1/53 1/73 +, &c. = ~, 1 + 1/34 + 1/54 + 1/74, &c. = QIV 1 1/35 + 1/55 1/75 +, &c. = qV, &c. &c. 5. Multiplying the last equation in art. 3. by x/x, and taking the correct fluents, we have FI = 2 PII + 2 b X X2/2 x 1 x-2/22 x-3/32, &c. From whence, by multiplying by x/x, and taking the fluents, we get FII = 2 PII X + b X2 X3/2.3 + x-1 + x-2/23 + x-3/33, &c. Again, multiplying the last equation by x/x, and taking the correct fluents, we find FIII = 2 PIV + PII X2 + b X3/3 X4/2.3.4 x-1 x-2/24 x-3/34, &c. And, by proceeding in the same manner, we find FIV = 2 PIV X + PII X3/3 + b X4/3.4 X5/2.3.4.5 + x-1 + x-2/25 + x-3/35, &c. &c. &c. 6. Now, it is obvious, that x + x2/22 + x3/32, &c. the value of FI in art. 2. must be equal to 2 PII + 2 b X [557] X2/2 x-1 x-2/22 x-3/32, &c. the value of F in art. 5. when both series converge. Therefore, x + x-1/12 + x2 + x-2/22 + x3 + x-3/32, &c. is then = 2 PII + 2 b X X~/2. From which equation, by taking x equal to 1, we have 1/12 + 1/22 1/32 + 1/42 -, &c. = PII + b2 = PII a2; and, by taking x equal to 1/~ 1, we have 1/12 + 1/22 1/32 + 1/4~ -, &c. = 4 PII + 3 b2 = 4 PII 3 a2. Therefore 4 PII 3 a2 is = PII a2: Hence PII is found = 2 a2/3. Moreover 1/12 + 1/22 + 1/32 + 1/42, &c. being = PII, by supposition; and 1/12 + 1/22 1/32 + 1/42 -, &c. = PII a2, as found above; we, by subtraction, get 2/12 + 2/32 + 2/52, &c. (= 2 QII) = a2, and, consequently QII = a2/2. S C H O L I U M. The hyp. log. of 1/1 x being = x + x2/2 + x3/3, &c. we, by writing 1 x instead of x, have 4 C 2 Hyp. [558] Hyp. log. of 1/x = 1 x + 1 x~2/2 + 1 x~3/3, &c. and consequently X = 1 x 1 x~2/2 1 x~3/3, &c. Moreover the fluent of x/x ~ hyp. log. of 1/1 x is = x + x2/2x + x3/3~, &c. which vanishes when x vanishes; and the fluent of x/1 x ~ X is = 1 x~ + 1 x~2/22 + 1 x~3/32, &c. PII, being corrected so as to vanish when x vanishes. But the fluent of x/x ~ hyp. log. of 1/1 x + fluent of x/1 x ~ X is = X ~ hyp. log. of 1/1 x, which also vanishes when x vanishes. Therefore X ~ hyp. log. of 1/1 x is = x + x2 22 + x3/32, &c. + 1 x + 1 x~2/22 + 1 x~3/32, &c. PII. From whence, by taking x equal to 1/2, we find square of hyp. log. of 2 = 2 ~ 1/12.2~ + 1/22.22 + 1/32.23, &c. ~: hence, PII being before found = 2 a2/3, it appears that, when x is = 1/2, the series x + x2/22 + x3/32, &c. is = a2/3 1/2 ~ hyp. log. of 2~2. 7. Furthermore, x + x2/23 + x3/33, &c. the value of FII in art. 2. must be equal to 2 PII X + b X2 X3/2.3 + x-~ + [559] + x-2/23 + x-3/33, &c. the value of FII in art. 5. when both series converge. Therefore x x-1/13 + x2 x-2/23 + x3 x-3/33, &c. is then = 2 PII X + b X2 X3/2.3~ From whence, by taking x equal to 1, we have 4 b PII + 4 b3 8 b3/2.3 = 0; and, consequently, PII = 2 a~/3, as before found. And, by taking x equal to 1/~ 1, we find 2/~ 1 ~ qIII = 2 b PII + b3 b3/2.3 = 4 a3/3 ~ 1 a3/~ 1 + a3/2.3 ~ 1 = a3/2 ~ 1. Therefore qIII is = a3/4. 8. From what is done above, it evidently follows, that PIV is = 2 b2 PII/3 + 2.8 b4/3.4.5, PVI = 2 b2 PIV/3 + 8 b4 PII/3.4.5 + 3.32 b5/3.4.5.6.7, &c. &c. QIV = b2 PII + 3.2 b4/3.4, QVI = b2 PIV + 4 b4 PII/3.4 + 5.8 b~/3.4.5.67 &c. &c. [560] qV/~ 1 is = b PIV + b3 PII/2.3 + 9 b5/2.2.3.4.5, qVII/~ 1 = b PVI + b3 PIV/2.3 + b5 PII/2.3.4.5 + 13 b7/2.2.3.4.5.6.7, &c. &c. From whence the values of PIV, PVI, &c. QIV, QVI, &c. qV, qVII, &c. may be easily obtained, in terms of a. 9. Hyp. log. 1 + x/1 x~1/2 being = x + x3/3 + x5/5, &c. GI = fluent of x/x hyp. log. 1 + x/1 x~1/2 is = x + x3/32 + x5/52, &c. GII = fluent of x/x GI = x + x3/33 + x5/53, &c. GIII = fluent of x/x GII = x + x3/34 + x5/54, &c. &c. &c. &c. 10. By writing, in the first equation in the preceding article, 1/x instead of x, we have Hyp. log. 1 + 1/x/1 1/x~1/2 = x-1 + x-3/3 + x-5/5, &c. But the hyp. log. of 1 + 1/x/1 1/x~1/2 is = hyp. log. x + 1/x 1~1/2 = hyp. log. 1 + x/1 x~1/2 ~ hyp. log. ~ = ~ b x~ hyp. log. 1 + x/1 x~1/2. It [561] It is manifest, therefore, that Hyp. log. 1 + x/1 x~1/2 is = ~ b + x-1 + x-1/3 + x-1/5, &c. where, with respect to the two signs prefixed to b, the same observation may be made as in art. 3. 11. Multiplying the last equation by x/x, and taking the correct fluents, we have GI = 2 QII + b X x-1 x-3/32 x-5/52, &c. From whence, by multiplying by x/x, and taking the fluents, we get GII = 2 QIIX + b X2/2 + x-1 + x-3/33 + x-5/53, &c. Again, multiplying the last equation by x/x, and taking the correct fluents, we find GIII = 2 QIV + QIIX2 + b X3/2.3 x-1 x-3/34 x-5/54, &c. And, by proceeding in the same manner, we find GIV = 2 QIVX + QIIX3/3 + b X4/2.3.4 + x-1 + x-3/35 + x-5/55, &c. &c. &c. 12. Now, it is obvious, that x + x3/32 + x5/52, &c. the value of GI in art. 9. must be equal to 2 QII + b X x-1 x-3/32 x-5/52, &c. the value of GI in art. 11. when both series converge There4 [562] Therefore x + x-1/12 + x3 + x-3/32 + x5 + x-5/52, &c. is then = 2 QII + b X. From whence, by taking x equal to 1/~-1, we have 2 QII + b2 = 0; and, consequently, QII = a~/2, as in art. 6. 13. Likewise x + x3/33 + x5/53, &c. the value of GII in art. 9. must be equal to 2 QII X + b X2/2 + x-1 + x-3/33. + x-5/53, &c. the value of GII in art. 11. when both series converge. Therefore x-x-1/13 + x3 x-3/33 + x5-x-5/53, &c. is then = 2 QII X + b X2/2. Hence, by taking x = 1/~-1, we find 2/~-1 x q~ = 2 b QII + b3/2 = a3/2 ~-1; and, consequently, qIII = a3/4, as in art. 7. 14. From what is done in the last five articles, it evidently follows, that QIV is = b2 QII/2 + b4/2.2.3, qV/~-1 = b QIV + b3 QII/2.3 + b3/2.2.3.4, ~ [563] QVI is = b2 QIV/2 + b4 QII/2.3.4 + b6/2.~.3.4.5, qVII/~-1 = b QVI + b3 QIV/2.3 + b5 QII/2.3.4.5 + b7/2.2.3.4.5.6, &c. From whence (as well as from the theorems in art. 8.) may the values of QIV, qV, QVI, qVII, &c. be readily found, in terms of a. 15. GI being = x + x3/32 + x5/52, &c. by art. 9. HI = fluent of x ~x GI is = x~/12.3 + x5/32.5 + x7/52.7, &c. HII = fluent of ~x/x HI = x3/12.32 + x5/32.52 + x7/52.72, &c. HIII = fluent of x ~x HII = x5/12.32.5 + x7/32.52.7 + x9/52.72.9, &c. HIV = fluent of ~x/x HIII = x5/12.32.52 + x7/32.52.72 + x9/52.72.92, &c. &c. &c. &c. 16. Moreover, GI being = 2 QII + b X x-1 x-~/32 x-5/52, &c. by art. 11. we, by multiplying by x ~x, and taking the correct fluents, get HI = x2 QII QII + b x2 X/2 b x2/4 + b/4 x + 1 + 2 SII + x-1/1.32 + x-3/3.52 + x-5/5.72, &c. SII being put for the series 1/12.32 + 1/32.52 + 1/52.72, &c. V O L. LI. 4 D Now, [564] Now, it is obvious, that this value of HI must be equal to the value of HI in the preceding article, when both series converge. Therefore 3 x3 x-1/12.32 + 5 x5 3 x-3/32.52 + 7 x7 5 x-5/52.72, &c. is then = x2 QII QII + b x2 X/2 b x2/4 + b/4 x + 1 + 2 SII. Hence, by taking x equal to 1, we find 2 SII = b2 + 2 + 2 SII; and, consequently, SII = a2/4 1/2. And, by taking x equal to 1/~-1, we find 2/~-1 ~ 1/12.32 1/32.52 + 1/52.72 -, &c. = 2 QII b2/2 + b/2 1/~-1 + 1 + 2 SII = a/2~-1 1/~-1; and, consequently, 1/12.32 1/32.52 + 1/52.72 -, &c. = 1/~ a/4. 17. Seeing that QII is = a2/2, and SII = a2/4 1/2, it follows, from the last article, that HI is = x2 QII + b x2 X/2 b X2/4 + b/4 x + x-1/1.32 + x-3/3.52 + x-5/5.72, &c. From whence, by multiplying by ~x/x, and taking the correct fluent, we get HII [565] HII = x2 QII/2 + b x2 X/4 b x2/4 + b/4 + b X/4 x + a2/4 x-1/12.32 x-3/32.52 x-5/52.72, &c. And hence, by multiplying by x ~x, and taking the correct fluents, we have HIII = x4 QII/8 + b x4 X/16 5 b x4/64 + b x2/16 + b x2 X/8 + b/64 x3/3 x/9 + 4/9 + a2 x2/8 3 a2/16 + 4 SIII + x-1/1.32.52 + x-3/3.52.72 + x-5/5.72.92, &c. SIII being put for the series 1/12.32.52 + 1/32.52.72 + 1/52.72.92, &c. Now, this value of HIII being equal to the value of HIII in art. 15. when both series converge, it follows, that 5 x5 x-1/12.32.52 + 7 x7 3 x-3/32.52.72 + 9 x9 5 x-5/52.72.92, &c. is then = x4 QII/8 + b x4 X/16 5 b x4/64 + b x2/16 + b x2 X/8 + b/64 x3/3 x/9 + 4/9 + a2 x2/8 + 3 a2/16 4 SIII. Hence, by taking x equal to -1, we find 4 SIII = 3 b2/8 + 8/9 + 4 SIII; and, consequently, SIII = 3 a2/64 1/9. Many other instances of the use of this method might be given; but these may suffice to enable the intelligent reader to pursue the speculation farther, at his pleasure. 4 D 2 LV. Con
