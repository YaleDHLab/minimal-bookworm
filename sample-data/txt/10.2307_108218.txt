L 193 3 X. Researches in Physical Geology .-Second Series. By W. HoPKINs, Esq. MA. F.R.S., Fellow of the Royal Astronomical Society, of the Geological Society, ad of the Cambridge Philosophical Society. Received February 17,-Read March 7, 1839. On Precession and NNutation, assumi g the Interior of the Earth to be fluid and heterogeneous. HAVING in my last memoir completed the investigation of the amount of Precession and Nutation on the hypothesis of the earth's consisting of a homogeneous fluid mass contained in a homogeneous solid shell, I shall now extend the investigation to thre case in which both the interior fluid and exterior shell are considered heterogen'eous. 1. W1hen accelerating forces X, Y, Z act on any point x, y, z of a heterogeneous fluid mass, of which no part of the surface is free, and of which the density at the point x, y, z is , we have for the conditions of equilibrium {dY d&Z fdZ dXX dX d{Y (Is)~~ Sdwz+ Y Vd dzJ + Z~d 0. ? (II.) S constant throughout each surface of equal pressure. Now the forces which act on the internal fluid of the earth are (L.) The mutual attraction of the different particles of the fluid mass: (2.) The attraction of the solid shell on the fluid mass:@ (3.) The disturbing force of the sun: (4.) The disturbing force of the moon: TIe centrifugal force, the planes of rotation being parallel to the tangent plane at B' (fig. 2. First Series, Art. S.): This may be separated into two parts, viz. (5.) The resolved part on any point acting in a direction perpendicular to the axis of rotation; and (6.) T1he resolved part parallel to the axis of rotation. The forces (1.) and (2.) satisfy condition (I.), as is well known as do likewise (3.), (4.) and (5.), (lFirst Series, Arts. 8, 9, 10.). The force (6.), as has been shown (First Series, Art. 10.), gives Z = 2 w . x, which does not really satisfy the condition expressed by equation (.), since it does not satisfy the well-known equations from which it is derived* If, thcrefore, the forces (1.) (2.) (3.) (4.) and (5.) only acted on * It is hardly necessary to remark that equation (I.) is satisfied by Z = 2 w e /3 . x, only in consequence of the introduction of the extraneous factor Y (which here = 0) in the elimination of p from the three equations irom which (I.) is denyed. Mzcc XL. 2 C 194 MR. HOPKINS'S RESEARCHES IN PHYSICAL GEOLOGY. the fluid mass it would be in equilibrium, provided condition (II.) were satisfied; and if in addition to these the force (6.) should also act, it would be the only force producing motion in the fluid, provided the instantaneous surface of equal density should always be identical with that which would be the surface of equal pressure if the force (6.) did not act, since such an arrangement of the fluid would be necessary in order that the forces (l.) (2.) (3.) (4.) (5.) should produce no motion in the fluid. It has been shown (First Series, Art. 12.) that the force Z (= 2 x2 S P. x) on any particle (x y z) may be replaced by a force W2 S P . r, acting perpendicularly to the radius vector, and producing motion in the fluid, and another force which would be consistent with the equilibrium of the fluid. The latter of these may therefore be associated with the above forces, which would produce equilibrium, and the former (W2 s P . r) will be the only force producing motion, always supposing condition (IL.) to be satisfied with reference to all those forces which satisfy condition (I.). Consequently if these forces were such that the surfaces of equal density should be spherical, and if the inner surface of the shell were also accurately spherical, the angular velocity generated in the fluid about the axis of y in a unit of time would =-C02 s P, and would be entirely independent of the law according to which the density should vary in passing from one spherical surface of equal density to another. It would be the same for the heterogeneous as for the homogeneous fluid. The action of the force w2 & P . r, and therefore the above result will be modified in the case of the earth by the circumstances of the inner surface of the shell and the surfaces of equal density being spheroidal, instead of being spherical. It is manifest, however, that this modification will be of an order higher than W2 . P3, and may therefore be neglected, as before stated with reference to the homogeneous spheroid (First Series, Art. 14.). Again, in consequence of the fluid motion produced by the force w2 s r, the condition (II.) will not be accurately satisfied with reference to the forces which satisfy (I.), and these forces will therefore produce motion in the fluid. To estimate this motion, let us suppose no forces to act on the fluid except those which satisfy (I.), and let us suppose the surfaces of equal density to be displaced through indefinitely small spaces from those positions in which there wvould be perfect equilibrium. The tendency of the forces would be to bring back the instantaneous surfaces of equal density to their latter positions, and thus an oscillatory motion would arise; but it is manifest that no continuous angular motion of the whole mass could thus be produced, at least of the same order of magnitude as the whole oscillatory motion. Now, in our actual case, this motion could not be greater than quantities of the order s P, since the angular motion from which the perturbation we are considering arises, is of that order. Consequently the modification of our first result due to this cause may be neglected. Again, the disturbing forces of the sun and moon will produce an oscillation in the surfaces of equal density of the fluid mass, or an internal tide; but it is manaifest that MR. HOPKINS'S RESEARCHES IN PHYSICAL GEOLOGY. 195 no continuous angular motion of the whole fluid mass can arise from this oscillatory motion, which may here, therefore be also neglected. Hence, then, the angular motion of the fluid about the axis ofi y will be the same, to the required degree of approximation, whether the earth be heterogeneous or homuogeneous;S i. e. if, for the heterogeneous spheroid, we denote by (72) the quantity analogous to that in the homogeneous one denoted by 72 (First Series, Art. 16.), we shall have (72) = tY2 ?. Motion of the Shell. I shall now proceed to determine the motion of the heterogeneous shell; for which purpose we must find the values which the quantities A1 B1 D1 A2 B2 D2, &c. (First Series, Art. 5.) assume when the spheroid is heterogeneous ; or, adopting the notation of the last paragraph, we must find the values of (A1) (A2) (A3) (A4) (B1) (B2) (B3) (B4) (D1) (D2) (D3) (D4), and (Vi). 2.

The angular motion denoted by ma (First Series, Art. 15.) may be neglected in determining the value of p, as shown in Art. 23. (First Series). The motion to be taken account of is the internal tidal oscillation. The direction of each particle's tidalmotion will be approximately in a line through the earth's centre; and therefore, if we suppose a portion of the fluid to be contained in a rectilinear and rigid canal of small diameter, passing through the centre of the earth, the motion of the fluid and the fluid pressure at any point within the canal will not be affected. Let r be the distance of an element of the fluid contained in this canal from the centre of the earth; R the sum of the impressed forces acting on this element resolved in the direction of the canal; then, instead of the general equation above, we shall have dip= (R dt2) r d and II being the pressure at the centre, r the value of r at the interior surface of the shell, and p the pressure there; and we shall have the moment of p round the axis of y (First Series, Art. 21.) =~S 2x8cos C(LI + ? (R-Ot dr) The value of R is given by the equation R =X cos O" + Y cos d' + Z cos 4, 4, 0', 0" being the angles which the direction of the canal makes with the axes of -, y, and x respectively. We many consider separately the effects of the different forces above mentioned which combined produce the force R. 4. Let us first take that part of R which depends on the mutual attractions of the particles constituting both the fluid and solid portions of the mass. If we examine the part of the expression under the sign Nfor the moment about the axis of y, given in article 23 of my first memoir, we observe that it consists partly of terms involving 3 as a factor, and partly of terms independent of f3, but that all the latter disappear when the integration is performed between the proper limits, leaving a result containing f as a factor. It was easy to foresee that this mnust be the case: 198 MR. HOPKINS'S RESEARCHES IN PHYSICAL GEOLOGY. because the moment considered in the article referred to was that of the centrifugal force, and would manifestly vanish with 3 In like manner it is manifest that the moment about the axis of y, produced by that part of R which depends on the mutual attractions of the particles of the whole mass, must vanish with (, i. e. when the instantaneous axis of rotation of the fluid coincides with the spheroidal axis of the shell. Consequently all the terms which need be retained in R, in the above expression, must involve P as a factor, and, therefore, all terms in R involving ? may be neglected, for since the terms retained must involve (3, those involving s would be of the order A ( under the integral sign ; and since the whole integral is multiplied by s, the corresponding terms in the result would be of the order S2 P, terms which have always been rejected. With this restriction the attraction on a point at the distance r from the centre in the direction of r, or the value of R, will 4 7r g I H d rf 4 7r <p (r) r and the corresponding moment about the axis of y =2sEx~cos4(H +4z ,fr f(ipdr) Again, in the expression for e we may reject all terms involving A, for the same reason as they have been rejected in the expression for R, which will reduce the expression for e to the same form as if the surface of equal pressure were a sphere, i. e. e will become a function of r. Hence, since the quantity under the signf will now be a function of r, and all terms in the definite integral which do not involve the factor 3 must disappear, the above expression for the moment about the axis of y mnay bie written 2 sE x S cos 4 (IT + PT (0)). Also (a being, as heretofore, the axis of the interior surface of the shell) r = a + terms involving a, and therefore for T (r) we may substitute J (a); and the moment becomes = 2s(IIH+?P3 (a)) NxScosC =0 when integrated between the proper limits. 5. Let us now consider that part of R which depends on the centrifugal force on the fluid. Taking those terms in the expression for the resolved parts of this force which are independent of the factor s ( (First Series, Art. 23.), we have for these parts w2 xi and W ~ye, parallel to the axes of x! and y' respectively, the axis of rotation MR. HOPKINS'S RESEARCHES IN PHYSICAL GEOLOGY. 199 of the fluid being the axis of 2>'. Making the spheroidal axis of the shell the axis of z, and the plane of x z the same as that of 'z', we have xi = cos (3 + z sin ( = + z sin3, .y _y. Therefore X XI2x'cos3 = W2 {XcCOS2p + z sin P cos P}, y W,2y I -v Z = w2X'Sin3 c2 {XCOS[3sinf3 + XZsin2p}l. Also z = r cos 4, y = r sin 4 sin , = r sin 4 cos and therefore COs 4" r sin 4 cos P, r cos 4' = sin 4 sin 0. Hence R X cos 4" + Y cos 4' + Z cos 4, = w2{ (x cos23 + T sin2f3) sin d cos P + W2ysindsinp + sin 2 ( + z sin2 ) cos } In this expression all the term-s may be omitted except those which involve P as a factor, for the reasons assigned above (Art. 4.), and thus (omitting also termis of the order 32) the above expression becomes 2 ,sin 2! 0 (z sin d (>1os p + x cos ) -2sin 213 sin 4 cos 4 cos p r. And fri sa R d. = g,2sin 2 3 sin d cos 0 cos r dr. Or putting r a, we have the moment about the axis of y =2 s$xScos (]nI+ 2sin2 (3sinocosacos J) agrdr). But xS.cost=a3sin2 6 cos 4 cos p 4 (First Series, Art. 23.) and therefore, putting /fr dr =-f (a), and omitting the first term in the above expression (since it vanishes between the 200 MR.

We have now to consider that part of R which depends on the sun's action, Let X', ', Z' he the disturbing forces of the sun parallel to the axes of , y, z respectively, the plane of x z being now so taken as to pass through the sun's centre. Then if A be as heretofore the N. P. D. of the sun, we have (First Series, Art. 21.) X'=-x sin A + c Z CosA, r3 r Z= cs3yo r2 Pf -r PO F 2 i MR.

In the formula R = X cos 0" 4Y cos 0' + Z cos 0, putting for X, Y, Z the above values of X', Y', ZX, we find R = sin 2 A cos 0 sin 0 cos p r + terms which involve even powers of cos p, and r3 which, therefore, when multiplied by x b S cos G (= a3 sin2 d cos d cos P d P d 0), will contain odd powers of cos p, and will therefore disappear after the final integration.

If g be constant and unity, 2 f (a) = a2, and the expression becomes the same as that for the homogeneous spheroid.

MDCCCXL. 2DV 202 MR. HOPKINS'S RESEARCHES IN PHYSICAL GEOLOGY. By a precisely similar investigation applied to the moon's action we obtain (A4) h A4, (B4) = h B4, (D4) = hD4. 7. It remains for us to determine the approximate value of dt2 Since the exact position and form of any surface of equal pressure and density in the internal fluid will depend on the disturbing forces of the sun and moon, as well as on the mutual attractions of the different particles of the whole mass, it will be constantly varying with the positions of those luminaries. The hypothesis I shall d2r r make for the purpose of determining an approximate value of dt2 is this-that the instantaneous position and form of any surface of equal pressure and density are the same as those it would have in its position of equilibrium under the action of the forces at the proposed instant, and supposing the whole mass fluid. Each fluid particle would then move with the surface to which it belongs, and in a direction at least very ape proximately normal to it, and therefore passing very nearly through the centre of the earth, as previously stated (Art. 3.). The extreme slowness of the absolute motion of each particle will render this hypothesis quite approximate enough for our purpose. We must first determine the surface of equal pressure, supposing it one of equilibrium; and in doing this we may restrict the investigation to the case of the sun's action. From the results thus obtained those depending on the moon's action will be immediately deducible. Let X, Y. Z be the whole of the forces on the fluid particle (x, y, z) parallel to the coordinate axes, arising from the attractions of the other particles of the mass, thea centrifugal force, and the disturbing force of the sun.

Or transposing the constant term, and putting a2 F (d p) for the sum of the other small terms, Const. = V + a2 F (d) Putting r _ a (1 + ay), where a is a small coefficient, and y here denotes a function of P and p, we have V 4 7r aQ a/ +C d /ao + + '+ 3 --Y,+ C T __(I _ a y)J g/P i.a2Fcd / +sY'+.. aX' +& a a, d (a atY +? + 4 + at ( y+. + (2 i +) a1) AY + &C , a being so taken that YO = 0, and a, = value of a at the earth's external surface.

To find the value of the second term of the denominator in the above value of r, I shall take the well-known expression for the density, viz. where q' a, = 1500.

Hence we have r { +9 g' ) and if g be the value of g' at the earth's surface where a =a g, _ approximately; and therefore r = a { 1 + -p * F (0 A) the equation to any instantaneous surface of equal pressure, supposing its actual instantaneous and statical forms and positions to be the same. It is a prolate spheroid, of which the axis is in the line joining the centres of the earth and sun. Tilis surface may be considered as fixed while the earth revolves in its diurnal motion, during which each fluid particle (according to our approximate hypothesis of its motion) will always remain in the same surface of equal pressure; and if r, 0 and p be taken as the coordinates of any one particle during its diurnal motion, o (its angular dt distance from the pole of the earth) will remain constant, and dowill equal the angular velocity of rotation.

The numerical value, however, -of the factor 407r,2 a, so sml htte i d2 r .1 9 s *is so small that the tern 'in d-t2 is about 2,-,th of the term in R. An exactly similar investigation is manifestly applicable to the case of the noon's d r action, from which it follows that the term in d depending on this cause will be about 7-0th of the corresponding term in R. The correction to be applied to the value of R obtained in article 6 is additive (since d-t2 is negative), and, instead of the results given in that article, we shall have (A) =IAA3(1 +h A) (A4)=It AS (] + -k0) nearly with similar modifications of the quantities B3 B4, &c. 8. If the interior fluid were homogeneous, it is manifest that the attraction of its different partices on those olf the shell could have no tendency to turn the shell about the axis of y, whatever might be the position of the spheroidal axis with respect to the axis of rotation of the fluid. This will not be accurately true when the fluid is heterogeneous; but it may easily be shown that this effect mnay be neglected in our results. For, in the first place, the attraction between the whole shell and any fluid particle would vra~nish if the surfaces of equal density were all spheroidal weith the same ellipticityand can therefore only be jof an order of quantities depending on the 2X 0 6 eMR. HOPKINS'S RESEARCHES IN PHYSICAL GEOLOGY. difference of ellipticities of these surfaces. It must therefore involve a factor of the order a. Secondly, the direction of the attraction of the whole shell on the fluid particle (or of the fluid particle on the shell) will pass at a distance from the axis of y not exceeding a quantity of the order E a. Consequently, the moment of this attraction will involve the factor s2; and such being the case for every fluid particle, the moment of the whole attraction of the fluid on the shell will contain the factor S2. Thirdly, this moment must vanish with P, and must therefore contain 3 as a factor. It will consequently be not greater than quantities of the order 2 A, and may be neglected. 9. From the preceding results we obtain (A) = (A1) + (A2) + (A3) + (A4) (First Series, Art. 6.), -(I + s) (Al + A2)+ h (A3+ A4) (1 + ? ) When the solid shell is very thin, A3 and A4 are respectively much larger than Al and A2, since A3 A , and A4 -= . (First Series, Arts. 21, 22.). In that case, therefore, the precession will depend almost entirely on AS and A4, and the introduce tion of the factor I + c50 instead of unity will give a correction amounting to nearly ,5th of the whole precession, or something less than 'th of a second. For any but the most; inconsiderable thickness of the solid shell, the correction will be much less. It may, therefore, be altogether neglected, as a quantity of the same order as the terms involving 52 P. We shall then have (A)( + s) (Al + A2) + h (A3 + A4), (1 + s) (Al + A2) + q5 _ (Al + A2) (First Series, Arts. 21, 22.), (i + S ? q5 A 1) q A (First Series, Arts. 6, 21, 22.).

HOPKINS'S RESEARCHES IN PHYSICAL GEOLOGY. The coefficients in the terms which give the nutation are altered by the hypothesis of the earth's heterogeneity in the same ratio as the coefficient of precession. If we take the ellipticity of the earth = I ' the calculated value of PI is nearly 57", while the observed value of P' is only 50" 1. Consequently the value of the multiplier of P1 in the above expression for P1 Pr ought to equal nearly 8 If, then, the value of a, the ellipticity of the inner surface of the solid shell, be so much less than 6, as to satisfy this condition, precession and nutation may be as well accounted for on the hypothesis of the earth's internal fluidity, as on that of its entire solidity. The required difference, however, between s and el is such as to indicate that the least thickness of the earth's crust, compatible with the observed amount of precession, is considerable. The discussion of the evidence which the results of the preceding investigations afford on this point, combined with other considerations, must be reserved as the subject of a future communication to the Society.
