(302) V. A Letter from Dr. Hans Sloane, R. S. Secr. to the Right Honourable the Earl of Cromertie, in Answer to the foregoing Letter, &c. My Lord, I Had the Honour to receive your Lordship's very obliging and instructing Letter, relating to ~ ~, or Mosses in Scotland, and the Wood found in them; which I have communicated to the Royal Society, who commanded me to return your Lordship their most humble Thanks. I have seen many such in the North of Ireland, and know your Lordship's Account of them to be very exact and true. I have likewise been an Eye-witness there, that when the Turf diggers have come to the bottom, or firm Ground, by having dug out all the Earth proper to make Turf or Peat, and come to the Clay or other Soil, by draining off the Water, that then there have appeared Roots of ~ Trees, with their Stumps standing a Foot or two strait upright, and their Branches spread out on every side horizontally on that firm Surface; as if that had been formerly the outward Face of the Ground, and place of their Growth. And I remember to have observ'd these Roots to be sometimes so near one another, as that their Branches were, as it were, matted, grew over, and gave place to one another, as we every Day see in Roots of Trees where they grow too close. I saw once the body of a ~ Tree dug up so big, as to be judg'd fit for the main Post of a Wind-Mill; which was discover'd, as many of them, which are not found in digging Turf, are, by the (303) the Grass, which grew over it being, in a very dry Summer, of a yellowish colour. The Reverend Mr. de la Pryme sent me some of the Cones found with this Timber in the great Fenns of Lincolnshire, which differed in nothing from those of the Scotch Firr, which your Lordship has so plentifully growing in Scotland at this Day, and which some Years since were judged so proper by some to afford ~ for the Navy Royal, that I think some Persons were sent thither for that purpose. But they were not able to bring about what they intended, by reason of the Difficulties in the Roads by which they were to be conveyed to the Sea; which in Norway I have heard is in a great measure effected by the Rivers. Caesar, indeed, in his Commentaries says, that the sorts of Timber in this Island are the same as in France, praeter fagum & abietem, except Beach and Firr. Your Lordship is a sufficient Witness of his mistake as to one sort of these Trees, and the Beaches in the Chiltern Countries near London, prove the same as to the other. For the uses of this under-ground Timber, besides those of other Wood, it is split into pieces; and being lighted, supplies the use of Candles. It is also made into Ropes; as may be seen in the Musaeum of the Royal Society, by a long piece of such Rope, bought by the Honourable Edward Southwell Esq; in Newry Market in Ireland, and presented by him to the Royal Society; the long soaking in Water having render'd the Wood of those Trees fit to be made into Ropes. This seems to prove, that as the soaking of Hemp, Flax, Aloe Leaves, &c. in Water, dissolves the pulpy part, and leaves the fibrous fit for making into Threads and Ropes, so the long soaking of Trees may make in length of Time the same, or an analogous change in those of Wood and Timber. There are some things remarkable which I will beg leave to acquaint Y y 2 your (304) your Lordship with, relating to this Subject, and which, I think, are worth your Lordship's knowledge. One is, that I have seen what I thought had been pieces of Wood, not only in Clay Pits, but even in Quaries or Stone Pits, in the Blocks of Stone raised out of their Strata, or Layers; and have been assured by Mr.Bellers, he hath seen large pieces of Wood in the Stone Pits in Gloucestershire; and also that in Lancashire there is a Moss, or Turf Bogg, where the black spungy Mould, made use of for Peats, smells very strong of Bitumen, or Petroleum; of the Oil of which it yields a very great quantity by Distillation. And likewise, what the late Sir Edward Hannes told me, namely, that near the Lord Blessington's House at Blessington in Ireland, there appeared a Light where the Horses trampled with their Feet on a certain space of soft Ground. On my desire he procured me some of this Mould, which I have yet by me, and which agrees exactly in its dark colour, lightness, &c~ with Peat Earth. And on Examination of this by a Microscope, I found the light proceeded from many small half transparent whitish live Worms, which lay in it. The Blackness of the Oak, which your Lordship mentions, comes, in my Opinion, from the Vitriolic Juices of the Earth soak'd into the Oak, which being astringent is turn'd black by them. Your Lordship knows that Ink is made of Galls, an astringent Excrescence of a sort of Oak in Turkey, made by an Insect there; and of green ~, which is made of the Pyrites dissolv'd by Rain Water, and Iron. Earth of all sorts, and even Human Calculi, and the Ashes of Vegetables, have in them Particles of Iron, in greater or lesser quantities. The Pyrites is also very common. The Particles of Iron coming to be dissolv'd by this Pyrites, Subacid, or other Salts dissolv'd by Water, ~ perhaps by Water itself, and carried into these Boggs, there fastens to the Tree, soaks into it, and turns it black. These (305) These Particles in some River Water, fastening to the Oak Timber floated in it, give the same a darkish colour; taken notice of by Mr. Pepys in his Naval Memoirs of England, p. 71. where we are told by the most famous Ship-Builders of England, `` That the `` best Foreign Plank for the Royal Navy was brought `` either from Dantzick, Quinborow, (that is Koningsberg,) `` or Riga, of the Growth of Poland and Prussia, or from `` Hamburgh; namely, that sort thereof which is Shipp'd `` from thence of the Growth of Bohemia, distinguish'd `` by its Colour, as being much more black than the `` other, and rendred so (as is said) by its long sobbing `` in the Water during its Passage thither. In the Turf Boggs of Ireland 14 Foot deep, are found not only the Mouse-Deers Horns, mentioned in one of these Transactions, but likewise their whole Sceletons, wherein the Bones bear the same proportion to the like Bones of other Deer, as the Horns bear to their Horns, There are also found thereinGold Chains, Pieces of Money, and Roots of Heath, several musci, and Branches of Trees so soft, as to give no resistance to the Turf Spade: And I was told, that in cutting Turf in one, they at several ~ deep cut thro' what the Irish call a Ruskin of Butter (which was a ~, or Vessel,made of theBarks of Trees, used by the Old Irish for putting up their Butter.) And I remember, that in digging the wet Dock at ~, there were found at the bottom, about Nine Foot deep, Grass Leaves, Hazle Nuts, and Roots of Trees: And there also was found a Piece of Money, as they call'd it; which esteeming a Rarity, they sent to Sir Josiah Child. I had the Favour to have it sent me by Mrs. Willoughby, and it prov'd to be a Leaden Seal to some Bull of Pope Gregory the IX. who continued Pope from the Year of our Lord 1227 to 1241. I have nothing farther to trouble your Lordship with, but some few Passages I took notice ~ ~ ~ Itine(306) Itinerary, Vol. V. which have a near relation to these Matters, and shew the common Opinion in his Days of the cause of the destruction of Woods, the growing of Mosses and Pools; and that, at that time, in Wales, the sence of the Inhabitants was, that the under-ground Trees found there had formerly grown there; which, because they were writ by so Inquisitive and Learned a Person, and at such a distance of Time as that of the Reign of Henry the VIII. Your Lordship will Pardon me to subjoin them in his own Words, the Language of that time. I am, Your Lordship's most Obedient, and most humble Servant, H A N S S L O A N E. `` In these Deyes in Mone wher they digge Turves be `` founde greate Rootes of Trees that serve Men for `` Wood.
