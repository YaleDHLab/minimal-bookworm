[ 99 ] VI. On the Calculus of Symbols. By WILLIAM SPOTTISWOODE, ]JM.A., F.R.S. Made up of two Memoirs, one received November 4, Read November 21, 1861, the other received January 21, read January 30, 1862. IN a paper published in the Philosophical Transactions for 1861, p. 79, Mr. W. H. L. RUSSELL has constructed systems of multiplication and division for functions of noncommutative symbols, subject to the same laws of combination as those in Professor BoOLE's memoir " On a General Method in Analysis," Philosophical Transactions, 1844. In this calculus there are four systems of multiplication and division, viz. internal and external, both (1) when the functions are arranged in powers of ?, (2) when in powers of Zr, or, as they may be termed, the p-arrangement, and the ?r-arrangement. In the paper in question the author has confined himself, so far as division is concerned, to the case most useful in practice, in which the divisor is linear. And of this he has discussed in full only the e-arrangement. ? 1. Internal division of the 7r-arrangement by a linear factor. Adopting the same notation as Mr. RUSSELL, I propose here to investigate, in the first place, the condition that 4,(g)+4j() may be an internal factor of @~~~~~" Ig58@ lg5n+.0@() and to determine the quotient. This is partially discussed in pp. 73-75. Let da then performing the actual divisions, for brevity writing 4 for 4(), and @ for p(e), %pir+ o PX+P1 A 4'0 Pio pi+ Hence the condition that 4I(g>r+4o(g) may be an internal factor of @1(gr+@0(f) will be 4, ibo~g)-(jb,(g) 2 -~ 0. . . . . . . . . .

Before proceeding further, we may remark that the remainder, after internally dividing 3(g)53 +2(g) 2+ by YIl(g)5r+4/0(g)b can differ from that last above found only in respect of the remainder arising from the division of p3Qg)r' by the factor in question; hence we have now only to divide the tern. p,&3r by 4'(g>r+4i(g), and add the remainder so found to (2.), in order to have the condition required for the third degree. Proceeding to the division, writing X= y -, and -omitting for the present P,, which, since the division is internal, can be replaced as an external factor in the remainder, we have r+4X)r3(2-2 +z2-22 X +Xx2+ 2 r+z" -X5 2 _'72r(t22X')'+ (X_2G)5X+X3 2%X -3 + 3X%'-B Hence the condition that 4'(e)r+4o(g) may be an internal factor of 3+ 2 +pj(g)z+po(?) will be ,\f\4Io(~l) /_~i 2 34(\Aj___ ~ '(~ 4,(oA/?

The first term in the quotient will obviously be N N-M (. and the product of this into the divisor may, by means of LEIBNJTZ'S theorem, be written thus: where '(N-M-p) means the result of the operation tN-M-p or An alone, and MEcccxL (N-M)(N-M-1)p(N-M-p+ ) MDUCCLXII.~~~~~~~~~~~1 2 106 MR.

With a view to the second term in the dividend, the first term of the remainder (3.) is {/qN1I4,M zPE=N-M Mn 5N[N-M p](N-M-p)} N-1 in which the limits of p and m are subject to the further conditionp+m=N-1.

P+ P MEM =m((Do[N-_Mp\mNM +4 [IN-M-1, ]'' l + D2[N-M m2 M [ p] N ~1,]42) }Pr] and so generally the (r+t1)th term in the quotient will be XN-M-, where MR. W.

The final remainder is the (N-M+1)th; and the expression will be derived from (10.) by replacing r by N-M. It remains to develope the terms under the sign of summation in the expressions for the (Ds. In the first place (:OD pN simply. In the case of cD, the limiting values of p and rn are -p=0, 1, ..N-M, m=0, 1, ..m p +m=N-1. These give as the only admissible values p ,N-M N-M-1X M= M-1, M and consequently 1IN1 tM-1+ + ( M3MA In the case of cP2, the only admissible values are P =N-M , N-M-1, N-M-2, M= M-2, M-1, M giving (D=N-2 (PO { S(M-2 + (N -)^ I l NM)( -l) + -, s +(M)} Before proceeding further, it may be well to illustrate these formulae by an example. Taking the case of N=4, M= 3, we may determine the quotient and last remainder of internal division of @ (f)X4+ @(?),3 + 2(?)T2 + p I (? )r + po(g by '43(?fr)3+ 42(?2 + 4'+(_)'r+ 4'O(() and thence the conditions that the latter may be an internal factor of the former. By the formula given above, we have (Ol= P4 @=3 {1 2-1} (q)2 P2@4 (%PO++2+' %k2)+ ('4's +242)) (-1 + which will determine the quotient ((D)X2 + DI'X+ (D2)' 108 MR. W.
