The Leaves are of a deep Green above and pale below; its middle Rib prominent on both sides, the edges lightly curl'd, and as it were serrated; they are above a Span long, and not an Inch broad. This elegant Fern has been long an Inhabitant in our European Gardens: That accurate Botanist, John Bauhine, says he first saw it in the Garden of his old Friend Mr. John Heitzman, Apothecary at Basil, A. D. 1608. since which it hath been translated to Paris and London. Description. Place. Broad curl'd Hartstongue. Lingua Cervina maxima undulato folio Bob. H. Oxon. 557. 5. Sect. 14. Tab 1.

F Its (34) Its Leaves are of a pale yellowish Green, above 2 Inches broad, and a span long; crumpled on the edges, but not so much as Doctor Plukenet figures it, neither is it notcht on the edges, and in those respects Munting's Figure is truer. Mr. Bobart's also very well expresses it, which I suppose they both took from the living Plants. It's auriculated at the base, and as it were perforated by lapping over the stalks, in both which it differs from the Narrow Curl'd leaved. The Honourable Capt.Charles Hatton, my worthy and learned Friend, some Years since told me, he had seen many curious Varieties of this Plant in the Royal Garden at Paris, about the Time of that famous Flowerist Mons, Morin, who assured him he had raised them all from the Seed of the Common Hartstongue.

This is generally call'd Gramen Mannae, to which some add ~, because its eaten amongst the Germans; it ~ differs from our English broad-leaved Cocksfoot in its culture. The Italians call both these Capriola, Sanguinaria, and Sanguinella (because the Boys there put the tops up their Nostrils to make them Bleed) The Germans call it Scwaden.

I first gathered this in her Grace the Dutchess Dowager of Beaufort's Garden at Chelsea, where it flower'd plentifully, as it hath since done in the Physick Garden.

Calceolarius, a very curious Apothecary at Verona, who sent this to Mattbiolus, asserts, that the Leaves eaten as a Sallet, will effectually take away Warts, and <inferred>that</inferred> a Dram of the Seed taken inwardly for 3 Nights together, will do the same. Camerarius says a <inferred>certain</inferred> Surgeon at Padua cured Warts in any part of the Body, by giving a Spoonful of the Seed powdered for 3 Days at the Moons decrease, by which Secret he got a great deal of Money. Lobel affirms, that the Juice of the Leaves outwardly apply'd will cure Warts, as also taken in Wine it helps the biting of a Mad Dog. This Plant as said to take its Name from Zacintha, now call'd Zante, an Isle in the Jonian Vertues. Place, &c. (39) Jonian Sea, where it was first discovered.
