(26) A Note about some unusual Diamonds. THere came to our hands, some while since, a Representation of a considerable number of excellent Diamonds, sold by one Monsieur Tauernier to his King, after his last return from the East-Indies, whether he had made six Voyages by Land. Amongst these Diamonds there are described three of a very unusal colour; one weighing 112 13/6 Carats, of a very fine Violet-colour, and two of a Rose-pale colour all three of an Adamantin hardness, and upon that account esteemed Diamonds.
