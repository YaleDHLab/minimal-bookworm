t 404 0 7XXV. On Respiration. By William Allen, Esq. F. R. S. and William Hasledine Pepys, Esq. F. R. S. Read June 22, 1o89. O( )NE of the most prominent features in our last communica.. tion was the evolution of a considerable quantity of azote, when oxygen gas nearly pure was respired; and although a consi-t derable part of this azote must undoubtedly be attributed to the residual gas in the lungs, after the most forcible attempt at expiration, yet the fact seemed to demand still farther ins vestigation, it appearing of consequence to ascertain whether the increase of azote was uniform throughout the latter stages of the ex periment, or solely confined to the earlier periods. By adverting to our former Paper, it will be found, that in an experiment where more than 3ooo cubic inches of oxygen passed through the lungs in seven minutes and a quarter, 62 cubic inches of azote were found in the first 250 cubic inches expired, though the gas originally contained but 2,5 per cent. or only 6 cuIbic inches in this quantity ; in the two next portion s eprliTed, consisting of 56e cubic inches, we found j6 cubic inches of azote, though this quantity of gas, before it was respired, contained only 14,; these, first portions, were given off in about two minutes, and contained nearly ioo cubic inches of azote more than could be accounted for in the oxygen employed; hence it is plain, that a large proportion of the increase is evolved in the first periods of the process. Messrs. ALLEN and PEPYS on Respiration.s 405 Our attention was particularly directed to this point in the following experiment. The oxygen, procured as usual from hyperoxygenised muriate of potash, was found to contain four per cent. of azote; the experiment was conducted in the same manner as the preceding ones, except that the tubes of the gasometers were filled with oxygen, and the gas was not merely passed once through the lungs, but breathed backwards and forwards. In order to prolong the duration of the experiment, which began and ended with .-a forcible expiration, portions of the respired -gas were preserved for examination from each of the gasometers, in the following order: -No. 1. 244 2. 294 A. s8z 4. s66 ~5. 230 6. 266 7. 254 8. 288 9. 2,52 lo. i68 2544 The portion of oxygene remaining in the water gasometer of the original quantity, not employed in the experiment, was found upon trial to contain four per cent. of azote, as before.

ALLEN and PEPYS on RespiratwIn. here the deficiency was greater than we had ever remarked before; but on passing an equal quantity of common air from the water gasometer, and registering it in the mercurial ones, we were satisfied that the apparatus was quite perfect. It is, however, to be considered, that the respiration in this case was not natural, and that some small degree of force was required when the inspirations and expirations were made in the mercurial gasometers, which renders this experiment rather different from those which had preceded it; and it ap.e pears to us probable, that a portion of air was forced into the extremities of the bronchea, which could not be suddenly expelled by the strongest attempts at expiration. Hence also, perhaps, the constant though smaller deficiency, even when the air was only once passed through the lungs; but when the process is continued for a much longer time, it is probable that the vessels recover their tone, and are able to expel nearly the whole of the volume admitted. The air expired in the present instance, being examined in the manner described in our last paper, we found that 1o0 parts from each of the gasometers contained the following proportions: No.r i lo carbonic acid 21 azote 69 oxygen 100 No. 2. to carbonic acid, X 1 azote 79 oxygen 100 Mesvs .

The question now is, whether this increase of azote can be owing to the residual gas contained in the lungs at the beginning of the experiment, or whether a portion of oxygen is not actually exchanged for azote, when pure oxygen gas is respired. Here it may be useful to compare. the azote found in our former experiments on oxygen, with the present. Quantity Inferred Oxygen Gas Gas ex:Defi. respired in Azote Capacity Bar.

From the experiments of GOODWIN, we might be inclined to admit the capacity of the lungs, inferred from the ist and 4th experiments, as very possible; but it seems difficult to conceive that it can amount to 236 or 225 cubic inches, and yet this must be the case, unless a portion of azote is given off from the blood, or there is some process in nature by which it is capable of being produced from oxygen. Heaving, by the kindness of our friend HENRY CLINE, jUn 410 Messrs. ALLEN and PEPYS on Respiration. been furnished with the lungs of a stout man, about five feet ten inches high, taken from the body not long after death, and in a sound state, we proceeded to ascertain the quantity of air contained in this organ after the most complete expiration, as in death. HENRY CLINE had judiciously taken the precaution to divide the trachea just below the crichoid cartilage, before he opened the thorax; he then inserted a tube with a brass stop-cock, which he tied firmly to the trachea, and attached an empty bladder to the other end. The cock was then turned, so as to communicate with the bladder, and on opening the thorax 3I-i cubic inches of air were expelled into it. The weight of the lungs was four pounds one ounce. A very large glass jar being placed in a shallow tin vessel, was filled to the brim with water, the lungs were then completely immersed, and the water which flowed over, and was the measure of their volume, weighed six pounds two ounces; we next cut a portion of the lungs into small pieces, under a large inverted glass of water, and attempted to squeeze the air from the cells, but although several cubic inches were thus procured, we were soon convinced that it was utterly impossible to arrive at our object by these means, as no force that we could use seemed capable of expelling the air from the cellular membrane, into which it escaped from the vesicles. We therefore took portions of the lungs, which weighed 2774 grains; the mass being put into a piece of new hair cloth, was subjected to the action of a powerful screw press, and the fluid was received in a vessel; after twice undergoing this operation, the mass weighed only 66o grains. Its specific gravity was very nearly that of water, viz. ,930 water being -i,ooo: the fluid procured Messrs. ALLEN and PEPYS on Respiration. 411 by the press, was of the specific gravity of 1hon; this would make the specific gravity of the lungs 997 water being 1,ooo; hence it appears, that the substance of the lungs, and the con-tents of the blood-vessels together, are so near the specific gravity of water, that they may be fairly considered as the same. Then, as the mass of the lungs was equal to 4 pounds of water, though (6,2 pounds of water were displaced by them, and as a pound of water occupies the space of 28,875 cubic inches, we have the following calculation: lbs. oz. 6 2 water displaced by the lungs 4 i weight of the lungs 2 x, or 5, cubic inches of air in the lungs, to which must be added 31 ,58o the volume of the air forced into the bladder on opening the thorax. 91,134 and this gives us 91,134 cubic inches, as the air contained in; the lungs of this person after death; andwhen we reflect that the air must have been under compression, when the lungs were immnersed in water, some force being required to keep them down, and also that not less than 7 or 8 cubic inches must be contained in fauces, &c., we cannot estimate the whole. at less than ioo cubic inches. It is farther to be noted, that these ioo cubic inches would occupy much more space in the temperature of the human body, than in the mean temperature in which the examination was made; and this difference would be nearly 8 cubic inches ; the air left in the lungs, after complete. expiration, would412 ~ Messrs. ALLEN and PEPYS on Respiration. therefore be io8 cubic inches; but the mean of our experi ments would make it 183. Experiment 1. 141 2. 225 236 4. 133 4)735 183 we are then almost compelled to allow that when pure oxygen is respired, a portion of azote is given off from the blood. We now resolved to perform a series of experiments upon some animal which lived wholly upon vegetable food, and made choice of the Guinea pig as one of the most manageable. The apparatus consisted of our two large mercurial gaso. meters, which were made to communicate with a strong trough E, in the middle of which a small mahogany table D was made fast by a screw, for the purpose of supporting the animal under the bell-glass A, two holes were made through the table for the insertion of tubes to supply, and take off the air, each of them communicated with one of the mercurial gasometers ; the tube B delivered gas towards the upper part of the glass A, in order to bring the supply of fresh air near the head of the animal: the opening of the tube C was placed within half an inch of the table to convey off the respired air ; the gasometer connected with this tube, was made to communicate with amercurial bath G, in which portions of the respired air were preserved for examination. Quicksilver being Messrs. ALLEN and PEP-Ys on Respiratin 413 poured into the trough E, so as to rise to a level with the top of the mahogdny stand, we placed a Guinea pig upon it, witi the bell-glass over him, and as its edges were immersed in'. quicksilver, the animal was completely confined in atmosphenrc air: wve found that his body occupied the space of 39 cubic inches, which deducted from the cubic contents of the glass A, left 55 cubic inches for the airs confined with the pig, to which must be added A more for that contained in the tube C. First Exp eriment with AtmospJe c Air. The pig was placed upon the stand, and the apparatus arranged as represented in the plate: Al5o cubic inches of atmospheric air were admitted into the mercurial gasometer communicating with B: the gasometer communicatin with C was quite empty, the apparatus being tried was found perfectly air tight, and the whole quantity of air 3io cubic inches. The cocks H and I being opened, gentle pressure was made upon the glass of gasometer B, so as to cause the air to pass through A, which consequently drove an equal portion through the tube C into the empty gasometer; a quarter of an hour was employed in passing the gas, which measured exactly 250 cubic inches 'in C, so that there was no alteration of volume; the cocks II and I were now closed, and the respired air being examined by the usual methods, ioo parts were found to contain S carbonic acid iG oxygen 79 azote 100 MDCCCIX. :3 H 414 Messrs. ALLENand PEPYs on Respiration. As the air after the experiment had experienced no alteration of volume, and as it contained the same proportion of azote as atmospheric air, this substance had remained unaltered.

In this case, as in the human subject, the increase of azote takes place principally in the early periods. The whole azote contained in the 66 cubic inches, confined with the pig, Tras only j52),14, but supposing, which perhaps was not the case, that the 66 of common air were expelled by the first 250 cubic inches of oxygen, we should have 2?50 less 66 184 of oxygen, containing 5.per cent. azote, or 9,20 cubic inches; these a Idedl to the 52,14, would make 61,34 of azote to be found in tUre first gasometer of respired gas, but wve detected 75, SO that even on this supposition i j,66 of azote were added in the first twenty-four Minutes. The azote contained in the second gasometer before respiratiol, was 12,50 cubic inches, but after it had been respired for twenty-three minutes, we found 23,75, or an increase of 11 ,5 azote. The azote contained in the third gasometer, before respiration, wvas, as before, 12,50 cubic inches ; but after it had been respired for twenty-four minutes, we found 20, or an increase of 7,5o azote. The azote contained in the 66 cubic -inches, was 3,30 bt 'ec found 5,28, or an increase of ?,98 azote. .Messrs. ALLEN and PEPYs on Respzration. 421 From the results of these experiments, it seemed that whent the usualproportion of azote was not present in the gas respired, there was a disposition in the blood to give out a cere tain quantity in exchange for an equal volume of oxygen, and we resolved to try, whether this circumstance would occur when hydrogen was substituted for azote, we accordingly made a mixture containing 2 per cent. oxygen and 78 hydrogen. Experiment 6. Hydrogen and Oxygen. Trhe pig employed in the last experiment, was placed upon the stand in the glass A, with 66 cubic inches of common air as usual. 9.o cubic inches of the mixture were passed from the gasometer communicating with B through, the glass A into the gasometer communicating with C during sixteen minutes. The animal did not appear uneasy: a second quantity of 250 cubic inches was passed in seventeen minutes and three quarters: the animal did not seem to be in the least incommoded, A third quantity of 250 cubic inches was passed, in about sixteen minutes. And a fourth quantity of 250 cubic inches in eleven minutes and three quarters but during this time, the animal became very sleepy, and towards the end of the experiment, kept his eyes constantly shut; he, however, appeared to suffer nothing, and was easily roused for a short time by rapping at the side of the glass. At the end of sixty one minutes and a half, he was taken out, amnd we found that during this time, he had produced 6o,2o cubic inches of carbonic acid gas, or rather less than one cubic inch in a minute. It appears, that less carbonic acid was evolved 'in this instance in a given time, than when oxygen was respired, but' MDCCCIX. 3 J 422 1.Messrs. ALLEN and PEPYs on -Resiratio some circumstances occurred to prevent us froin discovering what change the azote had experienced: this point was, how. ever, decided by the following experiment. Experimn t 7. Hydrogen and Oxygen. Having mixed hydrogen and oxygen gases in such proportion as that the oxygen should rather exceed the quantity contained in atmospheric air, we placed the same animal in the glass A with 66 cubic inches of atmospheric air, 250 cubic inches of the mixture were admitted into gasometer B, from the large water gasometer, and gradually passed through the glass A into gasometer C, during fifteen minutes. The pig did not appear uneasy, and the respired gas measured 250 in C: a portion of this was preserved for examination, which we shall call No. i. s9o cubic inches more of the mixture were admitted into B, and gradually passed, as before, during thirteen minutes; it measured 2,5o in-C; and a portion No. 2 was preserved for examination. The animal did not seem to suffer any inconvenience. 250 cubic inches more of the mixture were admitted into B. and gradually passed, as before, through A into C during seventeen minutes. The animal now become quite sleepy, but did not appear to suffer any thing. He was taken out at the end of forty-minutes. At the close of the experiment, the remains of the mixture, which had stood about an hour in the large water gasometer, being examined was found to contain 22 per cent. of oxygen and no carbonic acid; of the residual 78 parts, 20 were mixed with io of oxygen, which had been previously found to contain Messrs.

ALLEN and Ptzs onRespiratzonk ing sleep, less carbonic acid is evolved than when the animal is exercising all its faculties. When atmospheric air alone is respired, we have uniformly found, that the carbonic acid evolved, added to the oxygen remaining, exactly equalled the oxygen existing in the air before it was respired, but in the present instance it was oneper cent. more, a circumstance which we are at present unable to account foro but it was constantly the case in all the threetrials..

The mixture before the experiment was found to contain 7i4 hydrogen. 100: 71,4:: 750: 53550 therefore the total quantity must be 53,5o cubic inches. Hydrogen after Experiment.

The second gasometer before it was connected with the glass A, contained but Si6,o cubic inches of azote; we found howr ever about 26, and what is remarkable, in the last gasometer there was no increase at all. Calculation for Carbonic Acid.

Tryhe foregoing experiments, seem to prove, i. That when atmospheric airalone is respired, even y an animal subsisting wholly upon vegetables, no other change takes place in it, than the substitution of a certain portion of carbonic acid gas, for an equal volume of oxygen.2. That when nearly pure oxygen gas isrespired, a pore tion of it is missing at the end of the experimnent, and its place supplied by a corresponding quantity of azote; the portion evolved in a given time, being greater in the -early than in the later periods. j. That the same thing takes place when -an animal is made to breathe a mixture of hydro0en and oxygen, in vhich Messrs. ALLEN and RnPyrxs on Respiration. the former is inl nearly the same proportion to the latter, as azote to oxygen in atmospheric air. 4. That an animal is capable of breathing a mixture of 78 parts hydrogen, and 92 oxygen for more than air hour, without suffering arty apparent inconvenience. S. That the excitability of an animal is much diminished awhen he breathes any considerable proportion of hydrogen gas, or that it at least has a tendency to produce sleep.. 6. That there is reason to, presume an animal evolves less carbonic acid gas during its sleeping, than in its waking hours. 7. That the lungs of a middle sized man contain more than io cubic inches of air after death. These experiments have been conducted without reference to any particular theory, and indeed some of the results were so contrary to our preconceived opinions, that we have been induced to bestow more than ordinary attention on the subject. Confident, however, that all those who repeat the experiments with the same care will arrive at the same results, we shall rest satisfied with stating the facts, not without a hope that those brilliant discoveries of Professor DAVY, which have already given us new views of the operations of nature, will in their progress furnish us with that explanation which it is in vain to expect at present. Azote or nitrogen, for instance, has been considered as a simple or elementary substance; it is recognised, however, principally by negative properties. Every gaseous fluid which will not support life or combustion, which is not absorbed by water, nor acted upon by the tests for oxygen, nor capable of being detonated with oxygen gas, is generally pro. t18X nE~~~ 1w, Q/UWA ?t ei t-^ ~ral e _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _]lniz ogf^rartr.

The'experiment of Professor BERZELIUS, leads us to suspect it of metallic properties; and those of DAVY make it probable that it is an oxydated body; the subject is still under discussion. But we may fairly indulge more than a hope that the ardent zeal, and well directed labours of the philosophers just rmentioned, will throw a new and important light upon this obscure and difficult subject.
