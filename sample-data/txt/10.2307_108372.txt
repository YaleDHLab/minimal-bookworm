[ 33 ] IY. Spermatozoa observed within the Mammiferous Ovum. By MARTIN BARRY, M.D., F.JLSS. L. and E. Received November 24,-Read December 8, 1842. As the results of my researches in Embryology have all been communicated to the Royal Society*, it seems proper to offer to its notice a single observation which I have lately made. On a former occasiont I stated that at certain periods an orifice was sometimes visible in the thick transparent membrane (" zona pellucida") of the mammiferous ovum; and that once I had seen an object very much resembling a spermatozoon in the orifice. But spermatozoa, so far as I am aware, have nevei' been described as seen within the ovum of any animal. It may therefore be interesting to physiologists to be informed that about a fortnight since, in examining some ova of the Rabbit of twenty-four hours, from the Fallopian tube,-in which the orifice above-mentioned was no longer visible,-I unexpectedly discerned a number of spermatozoa in their interior. These ova were submitted to the inspection of Professor OWEN, and I afterwards showed one of them to Professors SHARPEY and GRAINGER, all of whom agreed that the spermatozoa were contained within the ovum+. London, 21st November, 1842.* Philosophical Transactions, 1838-39-40-41. t Ibid. 1840, p. 533. + [The ova were in that state in which the essential part-the germ-consists of two cells. The spermatozoa lay around and between these cells; and when the ova were first examined I thought I discerned traces of spermatozoa even within the cells. While the paper is going through the press, the opportunity is afforded me for mentioning that I have this day confirmed the observation above recorded; several ova from the Fallopian tube of another rabbit, in a somewhat earlier stage, having presented spermatozoa in their interior ;-i. e. (as in the first observation)within the thick transparent membrane (" zona pellucida") brought with the ovum from the ovary.-31st March, 1843.]MDCCCXLIII.
