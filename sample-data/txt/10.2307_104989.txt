XCVI. An Account of an unusual Agitation of the Sea, at Ildfarcombe, in Devonshire, Feb. 27, 1756. By the Rev. Mr. Prince, of Barnstable: Communicated by the Rev. Jeremiah Milles, D. D. F. R. S. ON Friday, the 27th day of February last, at six in the evening, the weather being then extremely fair, as it had been for some time before, and continued for some days afterwards, the sea being exceedingly calm, a rumbling noise was heard, like that, which usually precedes what the sailors call a ground-sea, only it was much louder. The tide, at that time, was above half ebbed, and retired as far as the head of the key, leaving the vessels, within the pier, on dry ground: when on a sudden the sea came on with a great run, filling the quay to the height of six feet perpendicular; and the water remained at the same height near half an hour, but was all the time agitated as in astorm. By this means all the vessels were afloat; some broke loose from their moorings, and on the recess of the waters were likely to be carried out to sea. The consternation, which this occasioned, gave no Read May 13. 1756. [643] no leisure for accurate observation, nor could any one inform me of the exact distance from the time of the first swell till the waters rose to the height of six feet, some speaking of four, others of five or or six minutes. It is to be observed, that the like phaenomenon happened on the 1st of November last, and the waters then rose to the same perpendicular height.
