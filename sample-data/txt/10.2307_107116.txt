E 8,5 j V. On the Idependence of the anatytical and geometrical Methods of Investigation; and on the Advantages to be derived from their Separation. By Robert Woodhouse, A. M. Fellow of Calus College, Cambridge. Comrnunicated by Joseph Planta, Esq. Sec. 1. S. Read January 14, iSons 0N E of the objects of the paper which last year I had the honour of presenting to the Royal Society, was to shew the insuffici ency in mathematical reasoning, of a principle of analogy, by which the properties demonstrated for one figure were to be transferred to another, to which the former was supposed to bear a resemblance; and the argument for the insufficiency of t he principle was this, that the analogy betw'een the two figures was neither antecedent to calculationb nor independent of it, and consequently could not regulate it; that analogy was the object of investigation, not the guide; the result of demonstration, not its directfing principle. Having shewn that analogy couldnot establish the truth of certain mathematical conclusions, I next endeavoured to shew why such conclusions had been rightly inferred; not by proposing any new excogitated principle, nor by pointing out an hitherto unobserved intellectual process; but I conceived they might be obtained by operations conducted in a manner similar to that by bhich, all reasoning with general terms is conducted, 86 Mr. WOODHOUSE on the Independence of the and that the relations between the symbols or general terms were to be established by giving the true meaning to the connecting signs, which indicate not so much the arithmetical computation of quantities, as certain algebraical operations. It was further observed, that, from certain established formulas, abridged symbols or general terms might be formed, which consequently must have their signification dependent on such formulas; and that, although the parts of certain abridged expressions could not separately be arithmetically computed, yet the expressions themselves might be legitimately employed in all algebraic operations. The chief object of my paper was to shew, that operations with imaginary quantities, as they are called, were strictly and logically conducted, that is, conducted after the same manner as operations with quantities that can be arithmetically computed: the question, whether calculation with imaginary symbols is commodious or not, was then slightly discussed.. I have since attentively considered it, and, what usually happens in such cases my inquiries have been extended beyond their origi. nal object; for, actual research has convinced me of what there were antecedent reasons for suspecting, that not only in the theory of angular functions, demonstration is most easy and direct by giving to quantities their true and natural* represen-. tation; but, that the introduction of expressions and formulas not analytical, into analytical investigation, has caused much ambiguity, confused notion, and paradox; that it has made # ( -_ ).* { E~~ + E '}* (2vI) * { .-J &c. I call the natural representationsof the cosines, sines, &c. of an arc x; because, admitting the algebraical notation, they, by strict inference, adequately, unambiguw ously, and solely, represent the cosines, sines, &c. analytical and geometrical Methods of Investigation. 87 demonstration prolix, by rendering it less direct, and has made it deficient in precision and exactness, by diverting the mind from the true source and derivation of analytical expression. The expressions and formulas alluded to are geometrical, that is, taken from the language of geometry, and established by its rules: they are to be found mixed with analytical expressions and reasonings, in all works on abstract science and, as they are certainly foreign and circumlocutory, if it can be shewn that they are not essentially necessary, there will exist an argument for their exclusion, especially if it appears that in analytical investigation they are productive of the evils above mentioned. That, in algebraical calculation, geometrical expressions and formulas are not essentially necessary, perhaps this short and easy consideration may convince us; since algebra is an universal language, it ought surely to be competent to express the conditions belonging to any subject of inquiry; and, if adequate expressions be obtained, then there is no doubt that with such, reasoning or deduction may be carried on. All expressions and formulas, such' as, sil. X, Cos. X, hyp. log. x, Sin. itx -2 cos.X Slyl sin. n ) x-sin. (na-i 9, X * The terms analysis, analytical, algebra, algebraical, have been so often distinguished, and so often confounded, that I shall not take the trouble again to distinguish them. I use the words analytical, algebraical, indifferently, in contradistinction to geometrical. The first relates to an arbitrary system of characters; the latter to a system of signs, that are supposed to bear a resemblance to the things signified, and in which system, lines and diagrams are used as the representatives of quantity: and I am principally induced to use the words indifferently, because, if analytical were properly defined, another word with a sufficient extent of meaning could not be found; for, by an improper limitation, the word algebraical has not an extensive signification, being frequently used in contradistinction to transcendental, exponential, &c. 88 Mt. WOODROUSE on the Independence of the fx (i _ *')z= circular arc,fx ,/' f-r_ elliptical arc, &c are geometrical, or involve geometrical language: they suppose the existence of a particular system of signs, and method of deduction; and relate to certain theorems, established conformably to such system and method. I. Sin. X, cos. x, tang. x, &c. These expressions are borrowed from geometry; but, analytically, denote certain functions of x Typographically considered, these expressions are more commodious than (QV )1{ (-x V_ } 2 { 8xV+ _x<_ }, &cC. but this is the sole advantage ; for, all analv tical operations with these latter signs are much easier, and more expeditious, than with the former; since, they are carried on after a manner analogous to that, by which operations with similar expressions are. But, if the geometrical expressions be retained, then, in order to calculate Faith them, recourse must be had to the geometrical method, proceeding by the similarity of triangles, the doctrines of proportions, and of prime and ultimate ratios; so that, in the same investigation, two methods of deduction, between which there is no similarity, must be em* ployed. II. The value offx ( 1 + x)1, is said to be a portion of the area of an hyperbola intercepted between two ordinates to its assymptotes but this if a foreign and circumlocutory mode of expression; since, to find the value of the area, x-. (it + x) must be expanded, and the integrals of the several terms taken; and this samve operation must have taken place, in order to appro ximate to the value offx (i + x)1, if no such curve as the hyperbola h ad ever been invented. ,11. fx[ -x --I; is said to equal the arc of the circle analytical and geometrical Methods of Investigation. 89 rads. a, sin. xi; but nothing is gained by this; since, in order to find the arc of a circle, x (i x)I is expanded, and the integrals of the several parts taken and added together. To shew (if it is necessary to add any thing more on so clear a point) thatfx { i -x } arc circle, is merely a mode of expression borrowed from geometry; suppose the investigation of the properties of motion to have been prior to the investigation of the properties of extension, for, that the science of geometry was first invented is properly an accidental circumstance, then, such an expression as fx { X *x } I might have occurred, and its value must have been exhibited as it really is now, that is, by expanding it, and integrating the several terms. lV. It is an objection certainly against these modes of expression, that they are foreign, and tend to produce confused and erroneous notions; for the student may be led by them to believe, that the determination of the values of certain analytical expressions, essentially require the existence of certain curves, and the investigation of their properties. But there is a more valid objection against them, which is, that they divert the mind from the true derivation of such expressions as Xx, x (1 -x. > {, &c. and consequently tend to produce ambiguity and indirect methods; for although, in order to obtain approximately the numerical value off 1 fx ( .z)1 2T, &c. it is convenient to expand the expressions, and to take the integrals of the result. ing terms, yet, if the symbol f denotes a reverse operation, f.Xfx o( --xe)i are not properly and by strict inference equal to (x-) -j {X-1)?+ X {X-1)-, &c. and x+ -+ 3+? ~,&c. But, in order to explain clearly what I mean, it is MDCCCII. N 9o Mr. WOODHousE on the Independence of the necessary to state what I understand by the integral or fluent of an expression. XT. Let px denote a function of x; if x be increased by o, then Ax becomes X (x + o), and q' (x + o), developed according to the powers of o, becomes px + Po + -j or + Ib-o, &c. where P is derived from ox, Q from P, R from Q, &c. by the same law ; so that the manner of deriving P being known, Q, R, &c. are known. The entire difference or increment of Ox is p (x+ o) qx; the differential or fluxion of qx is only a part of the difference or P.o. If, instead of o, dx, or x, be put, it is P.dxc or Pxa, the integral or fluent of Px is that function from which Pr' is derived; and, in order to remount to it, we must observe the manner or the operation by which it was deduced; and, by reversing such operation, the integral or fluent is obtained. Now, in taking the fluxion of certain functions of x, it appears there are conditions to which the indices of x without and under the vinculum are subject: hence, whether or not a proposed fluxion can have its fluent assigned, we must see if the fluxion has the necessary conditions. Expressions such as X xi ' &c. have not these conditions; and consequently there is no function Tx of x, such that the second term of the developement of m (X + x ) is equal either to or --, or or I,+-' or, &c. There are, howx J+X I ever, integral equations from which such expressions may be derived. Thus, let x= E. then 4t z, let 1+X=e .. ..S z,let a: 7:I =Xz Now, from these equations, the differential equations ?x zv = -z 'Vj4, &c. may, by expunging the exponential analytical andgeometrical Methods -of Investigation . 1. quantities, be derived; consequently, if the symbol f is to designate a reverse operation, I can only know what that reverse operation is, by attending to the manner by which the expres sions affected with the symbolf were derived.

Hence,, if the symbolf is made to denote a reverse operation, the integral equations of the preceding differential equations have: been rightly assigned. All other methods of assigning the integrals by the properties of logarithms; by circular arcs' by logarithmic and hyperbolic curves are indirect, foreign, and ambiguous. VII.

In the irreducible case of cubic equations, the root, it is said, may be exhibited by nmeans of certain lines drawn in a circle. There is, however independently of all geometrical considerations, a method of analytically expressing the root; and, from the analytical expression, although it is not the formula which from the time of CARDAN mathematicians have been seeking, the value of the root may in all cases be arithmetically computed; but, previously, it is necessary to shew what are the different symbols that may be substituted for z in the equations, X(2vK1) '{zZ . c4 zV'i, and V(T-X2) Q2_ {czVZv + Act=V~i }, Let x i, and X be the value of z that answers the equations i ( A -(rVV I } and o =~' gu(eWz X + ..~rVZ) which value of Or may be numerically computed from the expression ..XZ + -z3 + 58 + 75 ' &c.

I shall endeavour to solve this paradox, which, I think, originated partly from the introduction of geometrical considerations into an analytical investigation, by which the true derivation of certain expressions was concealed. It has appeared that the equation x=(2V ?1 tZ{ & z-1 } is true, when instead of z is put, O+z, or 20+Z, .... or nO+z, or 0 8 z or 30 -z+ ., orn+ i 2 2 ..~~or --.2 Now, if the fluxions of these equations are taken, and the equations cleared of exponential quantities, there results from each the same equation, to wit, z =.

Wlhat does the reversion of series mean? Merely this; a certain method or operation, according to which, one quantity being expressed in terms of another, the second may be expressed in terms of the first. Hence i all similar series, the operation must be the same; consequently, the result, which is merely the exhibition of a formula, must be the same so that, whatever is the series in terms of x, produced by reversion in ,t -+ Z 5. -&c. the same must be produced 1.2 3 1.2.3.4.5 by reversion in x = z' + &c. ,in x z" + &c. &c. The series produced by reversion in these cases is, x + 3' + 3. 3Z5 53 + &C. Hence it appears, that we know, a priori, that must happen which D'ALEMBERT considers as a paradox to have happened. Why this paradox found reception in the mind of this acute mathematician, I have stated, as mny opinion, one cause to have been, an inattention, from geometrical considerations, to the real origin and derivation of certain expressions that .Ippeared in the course of the calculation. Another causedI apprehend was, the want of precise notions on the force and analytical andgeometrical Methods of Inrestigatiotn io3 significationof the symbol A. It is true that its signification entirely depends on definition ; but, if the definition given of it in elementary treatises be adhered to, I believe it will be impose. sible to shew the justness and legitimacy of most mathematical processes.

P2 108 Mr. WOODrOUSE on the Independence of tHe That analytical science was advanced by the discovery of this theorem, is indeed true; but the circle and its lines were no farther useful or necessary, than as they afforded a mode of expressing, in geometrical language, an analytical truth. What is analytically expressed, may be analytically combined and resolved; and, if COTES, by the properties-of figures, has expressed his discovery, it is because the mathematicians of the time in which he lived, were more skilful and dexterous with the geometrical method than with the analytical. In order to demonstrate COTES'S property of the circle, consi-* dered as such, one of two different methods must be pursued. Either let the demonstration be strictly geometrical, according 'to the method of the ancients, or as completely analytical as possible; that is, let the demonstration be effected by the analytical method, from as few fundamental principles as possible. I know not on what grounds of perspicuity and rigour, the propriety of a demonstration half geometrical, half algebraical, can be established; for, besides the want of symmetry in such a demonstration, in strictness of reasoning, a separate discussion is necessary, to shew the propriety and justness of the application of analysis to certain properties of extension demonstrated geometrically. It is beside my present purpose, to inquire whether COTES'S theorem can be demonstrated strictly after the method of the ancients: hitherto it has not been so demonstrated. To demonstrate it analytically, in the most simple and direct manner, we must proceed from as few fundamental principles as possible; * and give to the quantities concerned, their true and natural * For the -analytical demonstration, all that is necessary to be known, 's what 'i proved in the 47th of the Elements. analytical and geometrical Methods of Investigation. 109 representation.

The, operation which this symbol indicates is as certain as any other operation, whether arithmetical or algebraical. XXIII. The demonstrations and method of deduction given in this paper shew, I think, with sufficient evidence, the introduction of geometrical expressions and formulas into analytical investigation to be perfectly unnecessary. it has appeared likewise, that such introduction embarrasses investigation, and causes ambiguity, by concealing the true derivation of expressions; and, although I do not wish to give importance to my own observations, by supposing a; greater confusion of notion to exist than really does, yet, I think, in what has been written and said, there may be detected a lurking opinion, that the value of certain expressions essentially demand the existence of geometrical curves and figures, and the investigation of their properties. XXIV. In the Appendix to the Arithmetica Universalis, p. 200. 219. &C. NEWTON, with great clearness and force of argument, has shewn the distinction to be made between the order of classing curves, analytically considered, that is, definedbut the demonstration of the latter theorem is not, it appears to me, to be reckoned in the number of strict demonstrations. The only objection against the demonstration of the very learned and ingenious author of the Calcul des Derivations, is, that it is rather indirect, and blended with geometrical expressions and formulas. analytical and geometrical Methods of Investigation. 117 by equations, and the order of classing them, considered' as generated by description. Moreover, he animadverts on the custom of confounding the two sciences of algebra and geometry; * and, if any authority is attached to his assertion, that the two sciences ought not to be confounded together, the, separation of geometry from algebra will thereby be equally urged as the separation of algebra from geometry. And it can-not be said with greater truth, that the simplicity of geometry is vitiated with algebraic equations, than that the simplicity of analysis is vitiated with geometrical forms and expressions. In. fact, each science oeught to -be kept distinct; and be made to derive its riches from its proper sources. XXV. It will not demand much meditation to be assured of -this truth, that, in any mathematical investigation, the geometrical method, properly so called, is not essentially or absolutely .necessary. The properties of extension and figure, to which this method has been especially appropriated, may be analytically treated; and here it is proper to state a distinction necessary to be made, between what may be called analytical geometry, and the application of analysis to geometry. The' first does not suppose or require theexistence of such a method as the geometrical; but, from a few fundamental principles, analy. tically investigates the propertiesof extension; whereas, in the latter, analysis is applied to propositions already; established by the genometrical method: so that, strictly, to shew the justness and propriety of the application, a sparate investigation is * ( Multiplicationes, divisiones,, et ejusmodi computa, in geometriam recens intro. " ductasunt: idque inconsulto, et contra primum institutum scientih hujus, &c.

We find, however, in general, a vague analogy substituted, as a connecting principle between the two methods. XXVI. The application of algebra to geometry, gives to DESCARTES the fairest title to fame for mathematical invention; yet the cause and nature of the benefit conferred on science by that application, seems to be indistinctly apprehended.* For, the Analytical Calculus, when applied to geometry, was not enriched with the truths of the latter science, because some connecting principle had been discovered, or some process invented by which the property of the two methods became common, and might, from one to the other, without formality be transferred; but because the investigation of certain properties could not proceed, without first improving the means by which they were to be investigated. These means DEsCARTEs improved: he found, when certain conditions in problems concerning extension were translated into the language of algebra, that the process of deduction with the general terms was slow and incommodious, because, such was the low state of the algebraic Calculus, the relation between the general terms had not been established. The aim and merit of DESCARTES's speculations is to have established this relation. If illustration were needed to make my meaning clear, I should say that DESCARTES, NEWTON, and D'ALEMBERT, benefited science precisely after the same manner. The first applied the analytical Calculus to extension; the second to motion; the third to the equilibrium, resistance, &c. of fluids. As the object of investigation: became * Thus far was the Analytical Calculus benefited by the existence of the geomed trical method: certain properties of figure and extension, discovered by the latter, became to the former, objects of investigation. analytical and geometrical Methods of Investzgation. i 19 more abstruse, it was found necessary to improve more and more the -means or instrument of investigation. XXVII As the question concerning the respective advantages of the ancient geometry and modern analysis, is not foreign to the subject of this Paper, I shall briefly state it, and endear vour to afford the means of arriving therein at something like a precise determination, The superiority of one method above another, must consist sin being either more logically strict in its deductions, or more luminous, or more commodious: for investigation. The discussion concerning Xthe strictness and accuracy may, I conceive, be immediately put aside, since no method of deduction is essen-c tially inaccurate; and, if in geometry the inferences are more strictly deduced than in the algebraic Calculus, the advantage is to be reckoned an accidental one, and arising from the great attention with which the former science has been cultivated. One method may, however, be essentially more perspicuous and more commodious. for investigation than :another; or, in uther words, the perspicuity and commodiousness of a method may depend on circumstances inherent in its 'nature and plan. Now, a person not sensible of the superior perspicuity of the geometrical method, would demand these circumstances, the necessary causes of perspicuity, to be pointed-out to him; which might be done, by stating that geometry, instead of a generic term, emnploys, as a particaular individual, the sign or representative of a genus and that, as in algebra, the signs are altogether arbitrary, in geometry, they bear a resemblance to the things signified, and are called natural signs, since the figure of a triangle, or square, suggests to the mind, the same tangible, figure in Europe, that it does in America c and this resemblance. 120 Mr. WOODR OUSE on the Independence of the of the sign to the thing signified, is supposed to be the chief cause of the superior clearness of geometrical demonstration,* Another cause may perhaps be thought to exist in this circumstance, that whatever is demonstrated, of a triangle or other diagram, considered as the representative of all triangles and diagrams, is moreover demonstrated of that individual triangle or diagram. A third, and more satisfactory cause than the last, may be, that in investigation, for the purpose of preventing ambiguity and mistake, it is frequently necessary to recur from the sign to the thing signified; which ismore easily done, the less general and arbitrary the modes of representation are; and, consequently, in geometry more easily than in algebra. I do not pretend to have assigned, accurately, and all, the causes of perspicuityof geometrical reasoning. It may depend on certain intellectual acts and processes, which it is beyond the power of philosophy to explain. The circumnstance, however, of the signs employed in geometry being natural signs, will prove its perspicuity only to a certain extent, and in certain cases. It mustfail to prove it, when the properties of solids are treated geometrically; because the representation of solids on a plane by diagrams, is not a natural representation, that is, would not suggest to all minds the same tangible portion of extension. It must fail likewise to prove it, in questions concerning radii ,of curvature, areas of curves, &c. or in all questions in which the fluxionary or differential Calculus is usually employed. The * Does there not, however, here arise a consideration that takes away from the cause of the perspicuity of geometrical demonstration? For the reasoning with a diagram cannot be generally true, except the diagram be considered abstractedly, and independent of those peculiar and distinguishing properties that determine its indir; viduality. -analytical and geometrical Methods of Investigatian. 121 lines and mixtilinear triangles therein exhibited cannot be called natural signs, since they are only imperfect and inadequate representations of other imaginary lines and triangles, of which the mind must form what notion it can. Not, however, to infer want of perspicuity from inefficiency in the cause assigned, if we employ the geometrical method, or view its employment in investigation, concerning motion, curves, &c. it will not appear a perspicuous method ; and, if instances of its obscurity were re-quired of me, I could find them, even in the immortal work of the Principia. Whether we consider the fact, or speculate about the cause, I think the geometrical method can only be allowed to have superior evidence in investigations of a simple nature. That the analytical calculus is more commodious for the deduction of truth than the geometrical, will not perhaps be contested; and, an examination into its nature, would shew why it is so well adapted for easy combination and extensive generalization. No language like the language of analysis, one of the greatest of modern mathematicians has observed, is capable of such elegance as flows from the developement of a long series of expressions connected one with the other, and all dependent on the same fundamental idea. If we view what has been respectively done by each method, in the explanation of natural phenomena, the superiority of the one above the other will appear immense: yet the cultivators of geometry were men of consummate abilities, and possessed this great advantage, that the method or instrument of thought -and reasoning which they employed had, during preceding times, received the greatest improvement. The analytical calculus, which has verified the principle of gravitation, was a hundred years ago in its infancy MDCCCIL R 21X -Mr. WOODHOUSE on the Independence of the The question, then, concerning the respective advantages of the ancient geometry and modern analysis, may be comprised within a short compass. If mental discipline and recreation are sought for, they may be found in both methods-; neither is essentially inaccurate and, although in simple inquiries the geometrical has greater evidence, in abstruse and intricate investigation the analytical is most luminous: but, if the expeditiots deduction of truth is the object, then I conceive the analytical calculus ought to be preferred. To arrive at a certain end, we should surely use the simplest means; and there is, I think, little to praise or emulate, in the labours of those who resolutely seek truth through the most difficult paths, who love what is arduous because it is arduous, and in subjects naturally difficult toil with instruments the most incommodious. XXVIII. If in matters of abstract science deference is ever due to-authority, it must be paid to that by which the study and use of the method of the ancients has been recommended. NEWTON has, however, brought forward no precise argumentsin favour of synthesis; and it is easy to conceive, that he would be naturally attached to a method long known and familiar to him,* and by means of which he was enabled to connect his own theory of curvilinear motions, with the researches of the ancients on conic sections, and with HuYGENSs discoveries relative to central forces and the evolutes of curves. The very ingenious and learned MATTHEW STEWARTf endeaa The circumstance of mathematicians having acquired a considerable dexterity in the management of the geometrical method, seems to be thea reason why they endea. voured to explain the doctrine of logarithms (a subject purely algebraical) by the introduction of the properties of curvse, j Words are frequently stated in -a delusive and mposing manner, not always analytical and geometrical Metiods of fivestigaf ai. voured to shew, that the geometrical calculus was competent to the explanation of natural phenomena; and wmith astonishing perseverance applied it to many investigations in physical astronomy. The labours of such a man are not hastily to be judged: yet every-one must determine for himself; and to me it seems, his reasonings ifrom their intricacy, call up so great a contention of the mind, that they prove, in no small degree, the unfitness of the geometrical method in all abstruse and intricate investigations. XXIX. It may, however, be asked are not there some subjects of inquiry to which the geometrical method is better adapted than the analytical ? and is not the theory of angular functions one of these sulbects ? I apprehend not: for, if the conditions intentionally. Dr. STEWART, (Preface to Sun's Distance,) and after him his ingenious biographer, for the purpose of holding up the superior simplicity of the geometrical calculus, has said, that in order to understand his solution, a knowledge of the ele. ments and conic sections only is requisite. But, in fact, the solution is effected by proposition heaped on proposition; and with equal truth and justness it might be said, that in order to understand the analytical solution, a knowledge only of common algebra is requisite since the methods by which the solution is effected, are really and properly branches of algebra. * D'AL E M B R r says, ?X there are cases in which analysis, instead of expediting, embarasses demonstration. These cases happen in the computation of angles: for angles can analytically be expressed only by their sines; and the expression of the sines of angles is often very complicated," &c. He adds., that it must depend on mathema. ticians, whether the method of the ancients or the modern analysis is to be employed, since it would be difficult to give on this head exact and general rules." In the very case adduced, I think demonstration expedited by the analytical calculus ; and, although 2 {i 4+vxV_1} is not so speedily put down as cos. x; yet all processes' of evolution, differentiations integration, &c. are much more easily performed with the former expression than with the latter. Other instances of subjects of inquiry, to which the geometrical method is said to be peculiarly well adapted, have been adduced; but Xstill End no convincing reason, why a mathematician must submit to the necessity of Mr. WOODHOUSE on the Independence of the can be adequately and unambiguously stated in the general terms of algebra, then deduction with such terms may be strictly made, and expeditiously; since it is to be made according to a known and established process. I have shewn at some length, that reasoning may be conducted with terms which separately cannot be arithmetically computed: for the mere process of deduction, it is not necessary to have distinct and complete notions of the things signified by the general terms. The principal object of the present paper is to shew, that the analytical calculus needs no aid from geometry, and ought to reject it, relying entirely on its own proper resources. By this means, it would gain perspicuity, precision, and conciseness; advantages not to be lightly estimated, by any one who has a regard to certainty and demonstration, or considers the bulk to which scientific treatises have of late years swelled. In order to prove and illustrate the opinion I wished to establish, I directed my search to those cases which have been always thought to require the aid of the geometrical method, By a purely analytical process, I have traced the origin and derivation of certain fluxionary expressions, usually referred to logarithms and circular arcs. I have given demonstrations of the series for the sine of an arc in terms of the arc; of the analytical formula for the root of a cubic equation in. the irreducible case; of the resolution of x. a n into quadratic factors; of the series for the chord, &c. of a multiple arc in terms of the simple arc, &c. which demonstrations, with as much confiu learning half a series of truths by one method, and half by another. These considera-. tions, however, depreciate the value of the geometrical method only in one point of view; for, -after all, the finest exemplar of clear and accurate reasoning is contained In the works of EU c L I D. analytical and geometrical Methods of Investigation. 125. dence as I dare assume,, knowing how fallaciously we judge of our own performances, I affirm to be strict and direct; establishedwithout artifices, and. without foreign aid drawn from geometrical theorems and the properties of curves. In some parts of this paper,, the subjects, for their importance, may be thought to be too slightly discussed;the fear of appearing prolix, has perhaps drivenme into brevity and obscurity. In, other parts, what I have advanced mnay be remote from common apprehension, or contrary to received opinion: but herew I make no apology; for, what I have written, has been written only after long meditation, and from, no love of singularity; if I cannot-add to truth," I do not desire distinction from " the "heresies of paradox."
