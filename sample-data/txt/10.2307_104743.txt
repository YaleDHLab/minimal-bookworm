XXXVI. Extract of a Letter from Chester, concerning an Earthquake felt there April 2. 1750. communicated by Robert Paul Esq; F. R. S. I CAN'T help informing you (as it is a Matter of Concern to every one) that, on Monday Night last, about 10 o' Clock, we felt in this City a Shock of an Earthquake. It was sensibly felt by all or most of the Inhabitants. A few Bricks were shook off a Chimney in Foreststreet; several House-bells were rung; the Centinel at the Castle was shook off his Seat in the Centrybox; the Houses all over the Town were shaken, and the People terribly frighten'd and alarm'd. It has been felt for some Miles round the Town, particularly at Barn-Hill, where the Houses were greatly shaken. We are in great Pears of another more violent. S s s s 2 XXXVII. Read May 3. 1750.
