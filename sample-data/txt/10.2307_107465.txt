C 141 J IX. On circulatingfunctions, and on the integration of a class of equations of finite d/ferences into which they enter as coo-d cients. By John F. W. Herschel, Esq. F. R. S. Read February ig, 1818. (i). So much has been written on the subject of recurring series, and the equations of differences from which they arise, that we can now expect little more to be added to their theory. This is not the case with the class of series, and their corresponding equations I propose to consider in the following pages, which bear a great analogy to the other, and include them as a particular case: I mean, series in which the same relation between a certain number of successive terms recurs periodically; the terms so related being separated by others connected by relations similar in their general analytical form, but modified by a variation 'in the constant or variable coefficients which enter into the equations expressing them. Such series have, I believe, never yet been considered as a -class: particular cases have very frequently occurred in the course of analytical investigations, and have then been treated by peculiar considerations of such a description as to give a very uninviting air to their theory, but no general view has hitherto been taken of their nature, and no uniform train of analytical artifices been exposed by whose aid they may be subjected to the" same modes of treatment as those of the ordinary kind. (sa). Let us imagine a series of quantities UO, U1 , U2, u, &c. Mr. HERSCHEL 01 cirCulatin fncitl os, 1C, 14 Produced from one another by the followving regular law, SO-z1ap 8 3=a vuO) adz-bate 83 4 bu3, &c. It is evident then that were the coefficients a, b, equal, the series wvould bT a recurring onze of the simplest kind, viz. a geeometric progression and inight be represented by a single equation of differences of the first order UX+. .. If this, howrever, be not the case, the ceries will consist of two distinct geometric progressions, the terms of which alternate with one another, thus U = go -2= abu0 u4 dbRuo &C. ga u0o a b2u, &c. It would seem then that no single equation of differences of the first order could comprehend all the terms of this series, so as to pass uninterruptedly from one to the other; and were this really the case, the method which has hitherto been always followed, of actually resolving it into the distinct series of which it consists, and instituting a separate process for the odd and the even values of x, so as to get the two equations of differences itx Xa -.U,,, and usx +7b, eujxt + Xwould be the only course we could pursue. That this, how ever, is not the case, at least in the instance before us, is evident, if wve consider that both these equations are included in the equation of the second order, ug + ab.u, the first integral of which will be an equation of the first order comnprehending the whole extent of the series, provided the constant be properly determined by the equation auau MDCCCXV1I1. J 16 Mr. HERSCHELon circulaig funcSions, &C'. At all events however several inconveniences embarrass this method. It is entirely at variance with the uniformity which ought to reign throughout all analytical operations, thus to descend into arithmetical details in the outset of symbolic investigation, and to vary our processes according to the numerical form of the quantities concerned. If we, would avoid this by having recourse to an equation of a higher order including all the separate cases, we are required either to seize at once, by an undirected effort of intellect, on the relation which connects the terms periodically equidistant, or to go through some preparatory process to discover it. which 9 for the most part will be found very troublesome. Mores over, it demands the actual formation of certain terrns to determine the constants, which are not (as will hereafter appear) necessary. It is true that in the very simple case I have just stated, these inconveniences, though really existing, are not felt. If we take one a little more complicated, they will speedily form a prominent part of the difficulty. Suppose the law of formation of the terms of a series were, for instance, as follows: i-au, + u0, u3=bu A3 & 22 u5=a a4+ u3,e 6 'bus + au 4 u7 cu6 + A ,&c. it would be necessary to divide the whole investigation into ix cases, and to integrate six several equations of differences U6x + z aU6 x+ l + 6x, u6x+ 3 6x+ z+Gu6x x, &C. and after all, the general term of the series would n ot be obtained, but merely the several general terms of six other series which, interlaced, as it were, one with the other, formn the series in question; which is in fact much the same way Mrt H.EscnT, onl circulating-functions, &c. 147 of proceeding as it wvould be to consider the series of natural numbers as consuirlg ofseveral other arithmetical progres, sions such as IL * * 4 IO !*^t?

A .8 .11. 14. &c. 3 e e 6 e e 9 4 w 12 15, &c. the general terms of which are respectively 3X a, Irk 1, 3x united into one, the general term of which is xt It is interesting then to discover some analytical artifice which shall obviate these inconveniences, by cornprehenditng the whole extent of these and sinilar series in one single equation, whose order shall be no higher than is absolutely indispensible which shall require no preparatory inve tigation to obtain it; nor the actual calculation of any superfluous terms for the determination of the constants in its integral; and, finally, whose integration shall lead to an expression in functions of the index x, such that the substitution of the natural progression of numbers in succession for x shall produce all the terms of the series in their order. Such an artifice, or train of artifices, I shall now proceed to explain. They turn upon a theorem familiar to every algebraist, but which does not seem to have been yet applied to all the uses of which it is susceptible. (s). Let us then represent by S.,,() the function ax+ X+ y(+&c. s, Bj, Tf &c. being the several roots of the equation zn-1 i o. If we have occasion to denote other functions similarly composed of the roots of other equations 0P -i =0,q -o, &c. they will therefore be represented as follows: 148 Mr. HERSCHELo0 cirulatignctio; s, & S (PL-. + c + &C. i __ IX x fyt x + &c & x 7 p q &C. but when only one quantity n is under consideration, wve shall, for convenience, omit the superior index (n) and write the function thus a + /'x +& ,SX= Let us also denote by Pi() the function aS s-)+b. S k . Sc omitting, in like manner, the superior index (n) and writing it PX when only one quantity n is considered. Here we suppose -XI b., &c., to represent any given functions of x and constant quantities. The functions S, and Pw are possessed then of the following properties. (i). Sw is unity whenever x is a multiple of n: in all other cases SI o. This is a well known property of the roots of unity. Hence, some one of the functions 5 SX SX * Sxn I is necessarily unity, the rest being all zero, though when the numerical form of is not specified, it is undecided which that one may be. Hence too it follows, that when x is a multiple of n, P or ax. S + bx* Sx_. + ** w t n+ reduces itself to av when x i is a multiple of , to when is such a multiple, to cX, and so on. Thus in all ca~ses PX -will reduce itself to a single term, the form of wich will be eitler a., bz, in rotation, after which the sa t functions recur over again, for some one of the rnUmbers Mr. HERSChEL on circulatingfmnctions, :&c. 149 is necessarily a multiple of n. If the coefficients a , bh, &c. be all constant, or if PX -a. tv + b. <I.,. + k. * xn * 1 -+ and we give to X the several values o, 1, 2, 3, 4, &C. to infinity, in succession, the first n values of P. will be in their order b k after which the same set of quantities will be reproduced 1i the same order by continuing the substitution, and so on to infinity. The function PX may be called in this case a carcum latz'ngfnction, and the same name (with less propriety how. ever) may be extended to the case when the coeflicints are variable. The system of coefficients a, b, c, . ... k may be called a period. Hence if the terms of a series be in rotation, a, c,. . 4, a, b, &c the general term will be truly represented by P ,or a S. + b SI + k + X and if they coincide in rotation with the values of n function s b . &c, thus: a., b-, Cv> k',,,aC" b,+, &c. the general term will be ax S, t+bX* SSx__ +* k*t SX().

S___ It should be remarked, that any number of the coefficients aX, bx X&c. may be zero, without infringing on the truth of this or the following propositions. (6). Every symmetrical function of S, 1S . X is invariable. Let f { ,Vz &c.} denote a symmetrical function of any number of elements x, y, z, &c. (in the manner proposed Mr. HERSCHEL on circulatingfunctions, &c. 151 by Mr. BABBAGE in the Philosophical Transactions for i8i6) and let us consider the symmetrical function f tSxs S;XP o *Sx-n+X. Then, by the nature of the roots of unity as demonstrated in most treatises on algebra, we have S = _=S =&C. x-n x_ -2n SXS S+?I = Sx_2n+ = &c. and so on.

For example PX +a_ f$ $ P,.,f+, a + b . + k . (8). We are now prepared to proceed to the integration of circulating equations, and to determine by that means the general terms of such series as depend on them. The manner of reducing the law of a series of this kind into an equation will be rendered evident by a simple instance. Suppose this law to be as follows: * This example is selected as having actually occurred in an enquiry of another nature. Mr. HERSCHEL on circulating functions ,c 1&c. U-auX + UO U3 -bu2 +U U _au3+U9 U2 au~~u0, U3bu2+u1,uazi3 + uZ Us bu4 + u3 ,&c. The period of the coefficients of the second terms of all these equations being a, b, if we take S. to represent the sum of the xth powers of the roots of z I 1 o, the circulating function a SX + b S,,. will express the general term of the series a, b, a, b, &c. and the equation =4(aSt+ bSX-_) uXX_ + u,-, will coincide in succession with each of the given ones, by giving x every integer value from z to infinity. This then is the equation of the series, which it only remains to inter grate. To this end -assume Ux X *V aS.+ bSx1 X putting P for aSt + bS* Then, by (7) we have P "P and the equation becomes, by substitution, any v PX PX v1/PX_ I ZJ-I + W -2 /P that is, v.2=v X_.

If the contrary Mr. HERSOHEL on circulating functions, &c. 15; be the case, when the progression 'A n 'As,. 'AX is exhausted, instead of going on to write -'A. --A. we must begin over again with tAxe &c. and so continue in regular rotation as often as may be necessary. Now to determine these functions, let each term be separately made to vanish, and a system of equations will be obtained as follows: 'Ax+ax . "Ax. 1+2axn-x A,, 2+, ...,a. .m n-mar ,A,.1 _-m+ al 2A+lb -'"A + b +*m, n-+aA m+lb;(2) C e @ . * 9 . * * . * . @ C a . . nAx+lk. }AZ "+ 2 kkn2Ak+ , , . n wwmA =m + 'k; () I These equations are of that peculiar class which LAPLACE has distinguished by the name of is re-entering equations" (equations rentrantes). The elimination of 'A., ZAG * . from them may be performed by the ordinary process for elimination between algebraic equations of the first degree, if we only prepare them by substituting x + t for x in (s), x+ for x in (3), and so on throughout ; because only one value of each of these functions is contained in each equation, and by this substitution that value becomes the same through. out the system. This done, the system is reduced to another, consisting of m equations, between the remaining m unknown functions, among which the process of elimination must then be pursued by the rules peculiar to equations of differences. Without encumbering our pages with the detail of this operation (which a possible difference in the numerical forms of rn and n renders necessarily very complex, when taken up in 156 Mr. HERSCHEL on circulating functions, &c. its general form) it will be sufficient to state that the final equation for determining nAX will be of the form nAz +mn'l Hz n +A mn-n+2Hix nAx+mn-in+ ...mH, .Ax _ IJ; (D) 'fixI 2Hx 9 &c. and I being certain known functions of x. The integrable cases of this equation (which is an ordinary one of finite differences, and although of the m x ntb order reducible by a very obvious substitution to the mtb ) are for the most part those in which all the functions TpX, Xp 2p$> mpt are circulating functions with constant coefficients, while m + 1p may be of any form whatever, variable or constant. In these cases then the proposed circulating equation is integrable, and they comprise nearly all which are of any real utility in the present state of analysis. The complete integral of the equation (D) involves m.n arbitrary constants; and, since by means of the system (C) all the other unknown functions 'Ax, Ax ,,...n"-A may be expressed by linear combinations of 'A and its successive values, these constants will be involved in each of the several terms of which uax consists. But as their number exceeds what is necessary for expressing the complete integral of the proposed, whose order is only m, there must exist equations of relation between them to the number of (ni). m, or else some of them must coalesce into one, by some peculiarity in the composition of these functions. But any such relations may be directly investigated by substituting the value of u mhayl btsvaluefuouofonx with all its superfluous constants in the proposed equation, and causing the result to vanish. It will be wvorth while, Mr. HERSCHEL on circulatingfunctions, &c 157 howevrer, to examine the integrable cases above alluded to rather more minutely. If we leave out the consideration of the last term m + Ip which is allowable, because by the well known theory of linear equations, the part of the integral dependent on the last term can be supplied afterwards, we have IX-o, and the rest of the coefficients of the equation (D) constant. Denoting them then by EH, 2H, mH and supposing M, A 9y, &c. to be the roots of m Inm-I I m-m z +'H .z + H.mz +,e mH-o let us take sx to represent the function (no/ )x + (nV7) + (v7 )x + &C. m and the integral of the equation A +mn+ I HnAx+mnn+ ..mH nAX O may be universally expressed as follows: XA = So{ IC I . -s+2C1. sX.+3CI . + 1 + Sx,{IC2.s + 2C sx-n + M. mc_. SXmn+4 e s B B B * X B B + Sx-n+ {Cn SX JrCn* Sx-n + **** Cn . sxM m + i This may be proved without difficulty from the known form of the integral of the equation of a recurring series. Now since the values of 'AI, Z & are al expressible by means of nA as above described, it is easily seen that these are all in like manner circulating finuctions of a similar form and since IA Sx _`A, S a 1,B8 Mr. HERSCHEL on circulating functions, &c. we may neglect in the expression of 'A all those terms which have not SZ for a multiplier; 'in that of 2A,, all but those multiplied by S _ ; and so on. This is a simplification of considerable moment, and will enable us in any assigned case to dispense with the troublesome and complicated process of determining 'A,, &c. by elimination from (C) after AX is obtained. In fact, if we suppose (*) Ae = ST{ . SCiWSv+2Ci Sx..n+ .` Cl .}-mn+n A= Sx.{ 'Ci. S,: + 2C2.

Sx -o7a u)&n in t a + + C. + , &. equating the coefficients of each separate term (AM:)' (ni), &c. to zero. This will give m x n equations of relation between the constants, but it will be found that m of there are necessary consequences of the others, in virtue of the equaPions ( n i1umber) In these equations the constants 1Cts &C. E C2a &c. are not intended to represent the same with those in the expression above given for A which are denoted by the same letters. They ar functions of them, whose form it is, of no monment to enquire, it being sufficient for our purpose, that the one system of coil. stants consists of an equal number with the others viz. m X n. Mr. HERSCHEL on circulatingfunctions, &c. 15 -r . +0 * , M+H 'M + ., MH o, &c. The above mentioned equations are therefore equivalent only to (n -a) . m distinct ones, which as we have already seen, iS the number of relations which ought to subsist between them. Hence then, all the constants except those which remain arbitrary may be eliminated from the express sion of u and the result will be the complete integral required. (io). Having thus determined the value of ud, when the last term of the proposed equation, or m+ is zero, if we would then extend the integration to cases where it, has any given form, the usual theory of linear equations will afford the requisite formula, and their application will be attended with no other embarrassment than what may arise from the integration of explicit functions of the forms ? So f (x) and : P O.f (x) Into this part of the subject, however, we need not enter at any length, because it may be avoided by pursuing the process originally laid down in (9) without neglecting the last term. We shall confine ourselves to the remark, that both the above expressions are reducible to the form ax.* Sx + Alp x_; + . kx. Sx%"n+ l and to the developement of one interesting case, viz, that in whichf(x) = i,or the function to be integrated is simply Si. Let us then denote : St by ux, and it is remarkable that in the determination of uw all the ordinary methods are unavailing. It is true that since S is of the form X i6o Mr. HERSCHEL on circulatingfunctions, &c. ax + 6X + Px" + &C. n the direct integration of each term will give Ut = { + +eg,~-&: | C but the peculiar values of a, 1, &c. (the roots of unity) render this expression useless. Neither is it of any service to regard Sx as the general term of a recurring series whose equation is S =S ix+n sx for the general expression of the sum of such a series becomes illusory when applied to this particular case. We shall be successful, however, if we regard uX as originating from an equation of differences Aum= Sx, or u, _=-ux-Sx, and treat it as a particular case of the equation integrated in (9). Thus if we assume uXAx Sx + 2Ax.Sx_ I + Ax SX * + I xtg the system of equations (C) becomes 2AX+I 'AXs 3A -'Ax -o 4Aw l-3A =-o ,Al n*x o These give zA-lA nIA _?IA 1 A 2_A r 4A -'A+I Ax AxZ+ I+ X + 3 x+3, c o-7-Ax'A s * e *aw * AZX + ?ZI and finally lAx+n "' Ax But, since a particular value of uS suffices to determine the general one, we need only seek a particular value of 'A Mr. HERSCHEL on circulatingfunctions, &c. A6i now such a one presents itself at once, viz. 'Ax X because n we have obviously -? n 1.

S.T a.S .*?*( ) S-n + I n Now it is evident that this series of terms will contain as many equal to unity, as there are units in the integer part of and all the rest are zero. Here then we have an analytical expression for the integer part of the quotient in the division of any one number, x, by any other, n, without in any way specifying their numerical form ; whence also a similar expression for the remainder in the same division is easily MDCCCXVIJJ. Y 162 Mr. HERSCHEL on circulatingfunctions, &c. obtained-:a proposition which seems likely to be of some service in the theory of numbers. The same expression may also be obtained by the following considerations. If x be a multiple of n, the integer part of 5 will evidently be represented by x; if x be of the form ma + i, or a multiple of n increased by unity, the same integer part will be represented by x". if of the form in + X n by ~ and so on. If then we can devise such a funct~ion f (x), that when x = in we shall have f (x) -o, when x -in f if(x) = 1, when x in + 2,f(x) 2, and so on, i being any integer whatever, it is evident that n will represent in general the integer part of n. Now o. Son + .1. SOI + 2. S (n)2 + *v** (n-) S() I is such a function. I thought it right to mention this, because the observation of this fact (so deduced) was among the first things which led me to the general consideration of circulating equations in the form I have here presented it. (1 ). The next case I propose to consider is that of circulating equations, in which the period of circulation is not the same in all the, coefficients. This, however, will not detain us long. Suppose (X). v8Z + P(P). go2 + De M)g P p(V) nt, p, q, . . . . t, v, denoting the respective periods of circulation in each of the coefficients. Take N to represent the product of all the numbers n. p. q.. . .. t. v, divided by their greatest common measure, and pXl) may be regarded as a circulating function, whose period of circulation is N, but the Mr. HERSCHEL on circulating functions, &c 163 coefficients of wlhichl, taken in their order, form N subordinalte periods within it, each consisting of the n coefficients of p(n)> Thus suppose . = A, and N 6 then p(2z) = ax. S(2) + be SARI S(6) f+ bS(6) + 6a * + bS6) + S(6 ?b (6) The identity of these two expressions is easily recognised:e when x is a multiple of 6, and therefore of 2, they both reduce themselves to as; when xm-i is such a multiple, to, b when x X, is a multiple of 6, x i is also one of 2, and therefore x is so consequently both functions reduce therms selves to a , and so on for every form of a, Thus every "coefficient of the proposed equation may be reduced to one whose period of circulation is N ; and this being done, the equation comes under the general form integrated in (9). The second series whose law is stated in Art. (2) leads to an equation of this kind. In fact the equation U, (a S(3)+ b S3)1+ c S(3)2) u -( s ) + S) u2 o coincides in succession with the whole series of equations there assigned; and if we vrite instead of the coefficients of this, the following, aS(6) S(6), + c S(6)+a 63 S -(6)o t c ,(6 S(6 : R) X+o S(6) + :S;(6) +Co&S (6) + ;3 S(6)5 they are reduced to a common period of circulation, and the equation may then be integrated as above. It remains to consider equations with more than one independent variable whose coefficients are circulating functions. i64 Mr. HERJSCFWL on circulath'ngfuncIions, &c. (12). A circulating function with two independent variat bles may have a double period of circulation, and may in general be represented thus: P.(m, n) (o)S(M) Q(n3 ( .o) em) S(n) + S +) aS (n) S ( + _ a x~ y xa * 'i. + a(mIX I S"g) S() one with three may have a triple one, and its expression will be p(, ,r= S;(m),(n) S(r) + ) S~m) S(1 s(r) 4 &c. and so on, and these functions possess general properties analogous to those of one variable. To avoid complication we will confine ourselves to the case of two variables, a similar mode of treatment being applicable to any number. First then, any function whatever of x, y, S(m), S() &c. and their successive values is reducible to the form P(mn n) X, Y and thus the sums, products, quotients, or powers of two or more such functions are reducible to a single one, as in the case of one variable. 2dly. Any symmetrical function whatever of the values P(m, n) P(me n) p(mr n) p(m, y) is invariable, provided the coefficients of each term in the expression of Pm7, n) are so; and it is equal to a function similarly composed of those coefficients. 3dly. Any circulating function of the form p(m, 7) may be reduced to another of the form P(> N), M and N being any multiples of m and n respectively, and thus any number of such functions may be reduced to the same period of circular Mr. HERSCHEL on circulatingfunctions, &C. 165 tion. Thlese properties are easily demonstrated as in the case of a single independent variable, and by their aid all circulating equations of partial differences may be cleared of their circulating form. (1i). Let the proposed equation of partial differences be X + (J.Q)p(M, n) a t (o Y) p(m, n) u U + Xs Y ', y * X-1 y^x,y x, x-y e.(r-i, S-I) p(m, n) _ ,, n) To integrate it, we assume u A(c)?)

The number of these equations is mxn, which being also that of the functions to be determined, they suffice for the purpose. i66 Mr. HERSCHEL on circulating fions , &c. It will be unnecessary to enter into the detail of the process of elimination in this case; it is always practicable, and leads to a final equation with constant coefficients, when those of the circulating functions which enter into the proposed equation are constant, just as in the case of one variable. (14). I am unwilling to occupy the pages of the Philosophical Transactions with examples, of the application of the processes here delivered to the various problems in -the pure and mixed mathematics where they afford either a remarkable simplicity in the result, or great neatness in the investigation. Such instances occur frequently in the evaluation of continued fractions and other similar functions where the denominators (or other elements) recur in a certain order. A variety of complicated questions relative to the simultaneous employment of capital in different mercantile transactions, can scarcely be treated with perspicuity in any other way, and other instances will readily suggest themselves to the reader whose experience in enquiries of this nature has led him to feel the inconvenience which these pages are designed to obviate. I will therefore merely subjoin one example of the integration of a circulating equation of the second order, with constant coefficients, by way of illustration of the methods themselves. Suppose then we have u _ (aS + bS )u 4 (US + 1S )u = o X X X-l USX_ I+ (as X Z where S is jthe sum of the xtb powers of the roots of .2_ 1 o assume u==A.

This gives the following four equations of condition among the constants.
