Extract of a Letter from Mons. Bonnet, F. R. S. of Geneva, to John Clephane, M. D. F. R. S. translated from the French. Geneva, June 3, 1754. THE inoculation of the small-pox continues to be attended with the greatest success in our city. Of seventy, who were inoculated, there was not one in any danger. Lausanne has been as it were forced to imitate us; and we hope, that this excellent method, which we received from England, will spread itself from one place to another, for the good of mankind. Read Dec. 12, 1754. Mons. de la Condamine has read to the Royal Academy of Sciences at Paris a dissertation upon this [819] this subject, which was greatly applauded. But I presume, that the French will be a long time in adopting the practice of inoculation. The clergy there throw a terrible obstacle in its way.
