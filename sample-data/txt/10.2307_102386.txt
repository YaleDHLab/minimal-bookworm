(663) VI. Part of a Letter from Mr. Thorseby, dated Leeds, July 10. 1697. to Dr. Martin Lister, Fellow of the Colledge of Physicians and Royal Society; concerning Two Roman Altars lately found in the North of England: With Notes on the same, by Tho Gale, D. D. and F. R. S. I Have drawn the Figures of Two Roman Altars, which my Correspondent in the North transmitted to me for my Thoughts of them; the former was taken out of the Roman-wall, not far from Collerton, or Chollarton*, and may tempt us to believe that the old Procolitia, which was the Station of the Cohors prima Batavorum, was rather there, which is an important Place, (where the River Tine interrupting the course of the Wall it was but necessary that the Foard should be secured by making one of the Cohorts keep that Station, and it is but two Miles and a half from Carrow, (where the Altar now is in the Possession of Mr. Forster) than at Pruddow, which is at least Ten Miles distance where Mr. Camden seem'd to fancy it. The other is at Blenkinsop ~ Castle in Northumberland, which I take to have been dedicated by Lucius Annius to the Goddess Nymphs Old and Young, and particularly to the Debonair (if Urbana be taken appellatively) Mansueta Claudia; for thus I read it, DEABUS * Prope Colerton Cilurnum. Notitia Dignitatum imperii,est tamen Procolitia alius locus a Cilurno. ~ Prope Blenkenshop & Widen, Vettii. Circa haec loca fontes. Utrumque Nomen hoc indicat. E e e e e 2 N Y M(664) NYMPHIS Veteribus ET IV ioribus MANSVET AE C L A V D I A E VRBanae, nuncupavit Hoc Lucius A IVS; and hereby the Defects in the Stone seem to be supplied with a right Number of Letters in each Vacuity, and this I the rather apprehend to be right, because 'tis now a Year since I communicated the same to an ingenious Gentleman, Dr. Cay of New-Castle (who was the Person that courteously sent me the Copies of both) and I hear not it is disapproved by any Critick upon the Place.
