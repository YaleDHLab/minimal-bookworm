Some particulars, communicated from forraign parts, concerning the Permanent Spott in Jupiter; and a Contest between two Artists about Optick Glasses, &c. Eustachio de Divinis (saith the Informer,) has written a large Letter, wherein he pretends, that the Permanent Spot in jupiter hath been first of all discovered with his Glasses; and that the P. Gotignies is the first that hath thence deduced the Motion of Jupiter about his Axis; and that Signior Cassini opposed it at first;to whom the said Gotignies wrote a letter of complaint thereupon. See Numb. I. of these Transactions; by the date whereof it will appeare, that that Spot was observed in England, a good while before any such thing was so much as heard of. The same Eustachio pretends likewise, that his great Glasses excell those of Campani; and that in all the tryals, made with them, they have performed better; and that Campani was not willing to do, what was necessary for well comparing the one with the other. viz. To put equall Eyeglasses in them, or to exchange the same Glasses. The said Divini affirms also, that he hath found a way to F f 2 know (210) know, whether an Object glass be good or not, onely by looking upon it, without trying. This would be of good use, especially if it should extend so far as to discerne the goodness of such a glass, whilst it is yet on the Cement.
