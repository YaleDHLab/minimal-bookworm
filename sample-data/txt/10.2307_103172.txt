(541) XI. A Description of the several Strata of Earth, Stone, Coal, &c. found in a Coal-Pit at the West End of Dudley in Staffordshire: By Mr. Fettiplace Bellers, F. R. S. To which is added, a Table of the Specifick Gravity of each Stratum: By Mr Fr. Hauksbee, F. R. S. Communicated by Dr. Hans Sloane, R. S. Secr. I. A Yellowish Clay, which lyes immediately under the Turf. II. A Blewish Clay. III. A Blewish hard Clay; the Miners call it Clunch. This is one of the certain Signs of Coal. It has in it Mineral Plants. IV. A Blewish soft Clay. V. A fine-grained Gray Stone: It lyes next the former, and is found in some Pits only. VI. A Clay almost like the First, only whiter. VII. A hard Gray Rock; with something like the Impressions of Vegetables, but none distinct. VIII. A Blew Clunch, like Numb. 3. with Mineral Plants in it. VIII. +. This Stratum (which is the same with Numb. 13.) was not taken. IX. Coal, called Bench-Coal. X. Coal, less black and shining than the former, called Slipper-Coal. XI. Coal, more black and shining, called Spin-Coal. XII. A Coal like Canal-Coal, by the Miners called Stone Coal. These Strata of Coal have between each 2 of (542) of them a Bat, of about the thickness of a Crown Piece. XIII. A black Substance, called the Dun-Row-Bat. XIV. A hard grey Iron Oar, called the Dun-Row Iron-Stone. XV. A blewish Bat, in which the following Iron-Stone lyes, called the White-Row. XVI. A hard blackish Iron Oar, lying in small Nodules, having between them a white Substance; and from thence by the Miners called the White-Row-Grains, or Iron Stone. XVII. A hard grey Iron Oar, with some white spots in it, called the Mid-row Grains. XVIII. A black fissile Substance, called the GublinBat. XIX. A hard blackish Iron Oar, with white spots in it, called the Gublin Iron-Stone. XX. A Bat, in Substance much like that of Numb. XVIII. XXI. A hard grey Iron Oar, called the Cannoc, or Cannot-Iron-Stone. XXII. A Bat, somewhat harder than Numb. XX. XXIII. A dark, gray, hard Iron Oar, called the Rubble Iron-Stone. XXIV. The Table-Bat, next under the Rubble IronStone. XXV. A coarse sort of Coal, called the Foot-Coal. XXVI. A black, brittle, shining Bat. XXVII. The Heathen-Coal. XXVIII. A Substance like a coarse Coal, but by the Miners called a Bat; perhaps because it does not burn well. XXIX. The Bench-Coal. XXX. (543) XXX. A Bat under the last, and is as low (viz. 188~ Feet) as they generally dig, tho' there is a coarse Coal under this. N. B. Those Substances, which divide the Strats of Coals and Iron Oars from each other, are called Bats by the Miners: They are generally black, consisting of a Matter peculiar to themselves, and are of a Texture nearest like Marle; tho' some of them are fissile, and others have a Substance not unlike Coal mixt with them.
