Some Observations on several Passages of the two last Months Transactions; relating to some, till now un-observed, Qualities in the Air; to the Mixing and Fermenting of Liquors in vacuo; to the History of Birds; the Anatomy of the Trunks of Vegetables; Baroscopes, &c. Some Experiments touching Animals; others, about producing Ice free from bubbles in vacuo,and giving by means of the Air-pump certain proprieties to things,which they never had before; others, touching Gun powder, and they way of discovering the quantity of Air contained therein, together with its degree of Compression in that body, &c. An Account of some Books; I. C O U R S d' A R C H I T E C T U R E, Premiere partie; par M. Francois Blondel. II. Dr. Henry Moore's Remarks upon two late Ingenious Treatises, &c. An I N D E X for the Tracts of this whole Year. Of the Incalescence of Quicksilver with Gold, generously imparted by B. R. The Introduction of the Publisher. THough the following discourse was by the Author of it made part of a short Examen of the supposed Sympathy between Gold and Quicksilver, (which it self belongs to another Treatise;) yet the worthiness of the subject, and the great curiosity that is observed among many Virtuosi, (not only Chymists, but others,) about Mercurial Preparations and Experiment, made me think I X x x might (516) might do them an acceptable piece of service, if I could prevail with the Author to sever them from the papers, whereto he had annex'd them, (but to which they seemed not absolutely necessary) though upon the conditions he judg'd requisite to insist on. And since I venture to impart before the time these things unto the Curious, I hope and desire, they will be so equitable as to indemnifie me to the Author, and not fruitlessly endeavour to put a person, that has already given so many proofs of his propensity to gratisie Ingenious men, upon making unseasonable answers to any Verbal or Epistolary Questions about things, wherein some considerations, that he thinks are not to be dispensed with by him, do as yet injoyn him silence. Now, to gratifie the Curious amongst Strangers, as well as those of our own Nation, the Publisher was not unwilling to give this discourse in Latin, as the Author hath been pleased to impart it in English. Follows the Discourse it self. Of Mercury growing hot with Gold; Communicated by B.R. I.-BUt that what I have hitherto said, may not be drawn to the disparagement or discouragement of those Spagyrists that possess or aspire to the nobler Arcana of Gold and Mercury, I must mind you to take notice, that what I have objected against the supposed Sympathy of Gold and Quicksilver, is spoken only of common Mercury, that being It whose Sympathy with Gold is wont to be celebrated. And though perhaps, a good part of the things I have alledg'd will be found applicable even to true running Mercuries; yet I would not be thought to deny, that there may be De Mercurio cum Auro incalefcente, Diatriba B. R. -VErum enimvero, ne quae hactenus disserui eo torqueantur, ac si laudes animosque viris illis Spagyricis demere velimus, qui Nobiliora Auri & Argenti Vivi arcana possident ambiuntve, monendus es mihi ut advertas, me quod contra suppositam Auri & Mercurii sympathiam objeci, de Vulgari duntaxat Mercurio dictum velle, cumille sit, cujus cum Auro sympathia celebrari sueverit. Et quamvis forte magna a me dictorum pars, consult a experientia, ad nativum etiam Mercurium currentem extendi possit; non tamen censere Lectorem velim, negare me, dari Argentum vivum posse (517) be a Quicksilver more subtle and penetrant than that which is common, and that those Chymists, that ground the sympathy of Gold and Mercury upon the Operations of a more Philosophical Mercury, may likewise argue for it more speciously than Vulgar Mercury will enable them to do. And to let you see on this occasion that I am not unkind to the Chymists, I will annex part of a Paper, written to a Friend to give him my Opinion about Mercuries Incalescence with Gold. 2. -And now I shall abruptly begin this Section with the consideration of a Probleme much agitated among the Curious, especially these that pretend, whether truly or vainly, to have more than ordinary insight into Chymistry: Among whom I find it hotly disputed, whether or no there be any such thing as a Mercury that will heat with Gold, that is, which by being barely mingled with that mettal reduced to fine parts, will, without the help of external heat, produce upon the commixture of those two Bodies very sensible heat. 3. The Affirmative of this Question is positively asserted by some Writers and others, that pretend to the Transmutation of Metals: For among these I have met posse Vulgari subtilius & penetrantius, istosque Chymicos, qut Auri & Mercurii Sympathiam niti volunt Mercurii magis philosophici operationibus, contendere etiam pro ea multo speciosius posse, quam si Vulgaris ~ Mercurius ~. Atque ut hac occasione testatum ~, me viros Chymiae addictos neutiquam aversari; subjungam hic scripti mei partem, ad Amicum quendam idcirco exarati, ut meam ipsi de Mercurii cum Auro ~lescentia opinionem depromerem. -Nunc vero abrupte Sectionem hanc ordiar Problematis cujusdam discussione, quod diu multumque inter Curiosos fuit agitatum, eos inprimis, qui, sive vere sive falso, obtendunt, se intimiores, quam vulgo concessum est, Chymiae recessus adiisse: Inter quos id calide disceptari reperio, U rum ejusmodi detur Mercurius, qui incalescat cum Auro, id est, qui, dum nude Metallo isti, adminutas admodum partes redacto, commiscetur, citra externi caloris adminiculum, fact a solummodo duorum illorum corporum cramate, sensibilem valde calorem pariat. Hujus Quaestionis Affirmativam mordicus tenent nonnulli Authores, aliique qui Metallorum Transmutationem sibi vendicant; Inter hos quippe, nonnullos videre X X X 2 mihi (518) met with some that ascribe this vertue of Incalescence withGold to the Mercuries extracted, as they suppose, from some compleat Metals, which are therefore in their Phrase styl'd Mercurii Corporum, or the Mercuries of the Metalline Bodies. 4. But the Negative part of the Question is more generally maintain'd, being not only embraced by far the greatest number of Philosophers and Physicians, but assented to by many of the more Learned Spagyrists themselves, especially the Modern, divers of whom have reckon'd this sort of Mercuries among the Chimaera's and Non-Entia of bragging Chymists. And I have the less wondered to find many Learned men so averse from believing this Incalescence of Mercury and Gold, because, having purposely enquir'd of several prying Alchymists, that have spent much labour, and many Trials, to find out things of this kind, and have of late years travelled into many parts of Europe to pry into the Secrets of other Seekers of Metalline Transmutations, they have apart ingenuously confessed to me, that they never actually saw any Incalescent Mercury, though they sometimes heard it boasted of by Alchymists; whose bold pretensions had the less weight with mihi licuit, qui hanc Incalescendi cum Auro virtutem Mercuriis adscribunt, experfectis quibusdam corporibus, ut autumant, elicitis; quos idcirco Mercurios Corporum, sive Mercurios corporum Metallicorum, nuncupare solent. At Negativam tuentur multo plures, iique non modo Philosophi & Medici, sed & ex ipsis Spagyricis doctrina clariores, inprimis ex neotericis & modernis, quorum non pauci hanc Mercuriorum familiam Chimaeris & Non-entibus grandiloquentium Chymistarum accensent. Atque eo minus mirabar, complures viros doctos adeo esse ab hoc Mercuri cum Auro Incalescentiae assensu alienos, quia, consulto quaesiti a me plures ex Alchymistis sagacioribus, qui multum impenderant operae, plurimaque Experimenta peregerant ad hujus generis arcana depromenda, quique per aliquot annos novissimos varias Europae partes permearant, ut aliorum, qui Transmutationes Metallicas vestigant, secreta rimarentur, illi, inquam, singuli seorsim a me rogati ingenue apud me fassi sunt, se revera nunquam incalescentem ullum Mercurium vidisse, licet id quandoque jactatum ab Alchymistis audivissent; quorum jactabundi obtentus eo minus apud me in hoc negotio valebant, quod a longo jam tempore notaveram, quantam Fraus (519) with me in this matter, because I had long taken notice, how great a confidence, fraud, or ignorance (for I would not think all those Cheats that are mistaken,) can give to some of that sort of men that I am speaking of. Insomuch that one of them having impos'd upon an honest Chymist, well known and much employed, with a pretended incalescent Mercury, they had the confidence to bring it me to convince me of the Experiment; but upon due Trial, I found not any sensible degree of that great heat that was promised. pretended to be salved by I know 5. But not withstanding all this, having for the reasons I have long since expressed in other Papers (and for some other Considerations that I have not judg'd fit to mention) lookt upon Mercury as a Body which is not necessarily so homogeneous as 'tis supposed, the Opinion I most lik'd of was, that of a possibility of an Incalescent Mercury. For notwithstanding the vulgarly supposed Similar nature of Quicksilver, which I willingly confess to be great enough to be admirable, it was yet congruous to my Principles, that a Liquor, which in weight, colour, total volatility,&c. was answerable to all the essential Properties for which a body is called Mercury, might yet have an Fraus vel Ignorantia (non enim omnes illos haberi impostores velim qui hallucinantur,) in nonnullis hujusmodi, de quibus loquor, vi. ris fiduciam parere possint; quae sane tanta erat, ut ~, cum eorum unus, bonae frugis Chymistam, multis notum multisque cperam suam locantem, supposito Mercurio incalescente fefellerat, ev fiduciae abriperentur, ut apud memet se sisterent, de Experimento illo me convicturi.At, re ut par erat explorata, nullum percepi sensibilem illius caloris gradu, quem promiserant. Which miscarriage was vainly not what unsatisfactory excuses. Verum enimvero, his omnibus nequicquam obstantibus, cum ex rationibus dudum in alio scripto a me expositis, aliisque de causis hic non memorandis, Argentum vivum, corpus reputem, quod non necessario tam sit homogeneum, ac passim habetur; illa mihi opinio prae caeteris allubuit, quae Mercurii incalescentis possibilitatem adstruit. Etenim, non obstante vulgo supposita Mercurii (ut sic dicam) Similaritate, quam adeo eximiam esse puto, ut parere admirationem possit, meis tamen Principiis consonum erat, Liquorem quendam, quipondere, colore, totali volatilitate, &c. omnes referebat proprietates essentiales, quarum respectu corpus aliquod Mercurii nomine venit, habere tamen posse internam ejusmodi partium (520) an internal constitution of parts, that might make it in some unobserved things considerably differing from common Mercury. And among these differing Qualities I did not know but one might well be, that of growing hot with Gold. And this Opinion I judg'd the more reasonable; because, having devised two waies (unpractised that I know of by any Chymist) the one, to to discover whether a clean and carefully distilled Mercury might not be a compounded Body, and have in it parts that were not; Mercurial and the other, out of such a fine distill'd Mercury to separate parts, and that in no despicable number, that are plainly heterogeneous; I found upon trial, that both the Methods I had thought on would succeed, which warranted me to think it possible, that a Mercury very fine and clean, and even purg'd by Sublimations and Distillations, may by Art have been made to assume and incorporate with it a multitude of heterogeneous Corpuscles, not to be discover'd, much less separated,(as those of Tinn, Lead,&c. may be) but by a skilful Artist. 6. This in the general may suffice to make me suspend my Judgment about the Probleme formerly propos'd, and to engage partium diathesin, quae in nonnullis hactenus non observatis insignem illi a Mercurio vulgari discrepantiam conciliare queat: Atque has inter Qualitates differentes nesciebam annon ea recenseri merito posset, qua incalescit cum Auro commixtus. Atque hanc Opinionem rationi eo magis consentaneam arbitrabar, quod, excogitata a me duplici methodo (hactenus a Chymicorum nullo, quod sciam, in praxin versa,) una quidem, ut manifestum redderem, essetne purus curateque distillatus Mercurius, corpus compositum, partesque contineret non-Mercuriales; altera vero, ex purificato cjusmodi & distillato Mercurio partes separandi non paucas manifesto heterogeneas; experiundo comperi, utramque illam methodum a me inventam successu gaudere: Id quod auctor amentum mihi haud leve erat, ut possibile existimarem, Mercurium ~ defaecatum, quin & per sublimationes & distillationes repurgatum, Arte posse eo redigi, ut assumat secumque conflet heterogeneorum corpusculorum multitudinem, quae nonnisi a perito Artis filio detegi, multo minus segregari queant (ut fieri de Stanneis, Plumbeis, &c. corpusculis potest.) Hoc generatim suffecerit, ut meum de Problemate supra proposito judicium suspendam, & ad experimenta sumenda properem, quibus (521) gage me to make trials, whether some of these heterogeneous particles that I found reducible with Mercury into a lasting Mercurial flux, might not so alter it as to dispose it to heat with Gold. But this was not sufficient to determine me to an assent; for to oblige me to admit incalescent Mercuries, it ought not to suffice, that 'tis possible or even probable, that there may be such, but there was necessary some positive proof that there are such; and that also through Gods blessing my Trials afforded me about the year 1652. 7. Some years after I was in possession of this Mercury, I found in some of their Books, that Chymists call Philosophers, some dark passages, whence I then ghess'd their knowledge of it, or of some other very like it; and in one of them I found, though not all in the very same place, an Allegorical description of it, the greatest part of which was not very difficult for me to understand; but not finding there any notice taken of the property of this Mercury to grow hot with Gold, I was induced to suspect, that either they had not the knowledge of it, or judg'd it unfit to be spoken of. But you will, I suppose, expect from me rather Narratives than Conjectures. And indeed 'tis but reaquibus palam reddatur, ~ liquae ex particulis illis heterogeneis, quas cum Mercurio in durabilem fluxum Mercurialem reduci posse deprehendi, it a alterare eum possint, ut ad incalescendum cum Auro ipsum aisponant. At non erat hoc satis ad cliciendum a me assensum; ut enim ad Mercurios incalescentes admittendum adaucerer, sufficere non debebat, possibiles eos esse, vel etiam probabiles, sed revera tales dari manifesta probatione erat evincendum: Bt hoc ipsum quoque, favente Deo, Experimenta mea, Anno 1652. circiter, comprobarunt. Post aliquot ab eo tempore annos, quo Mercurium hujusmodi jam possidebam, in quibusdam ex eorum, quos turba Chymica Philosophos nuncupat, libris obscura quaedam loca invenicham, undc tunc eorum de ipso, vel alto aliquo perquam ei simili cognitionem conjectabam; atque in ipsorum uno reperiebam (non tamen rem totam in uno plane eodemque loco) descriptionem ejus Allegoricam, cujus pars maxima adeo difficilis intellectu mihi non erat: At cum nihil ibi notatum viderem de illa Mercurii hujus proprietate, qua calorem cum Auro acquirit, in suspicionem incidi, cos vel cognitione illius fuisse destitutos, vel eam silentio premendam censuisse. At Tu sine dubio facti potius Narrationes, quam Conjecturas a me exspectas. (522) reasonable, that, having but mentioned to you a Phaenomenon whose Credibility is by many denied, I should take notice of some Circumstances fit to bring credit to it. And I shall the less grudge the pains of setting down several particular Phaenomena, because I presume you have not met with them, and because also it may gratifie some of your Chymical friends, who may have or discover some noble Mercury, by helping them to examine it, and to try whether it resemble ours. 8. That I might not then be imposed on by others, I several times made trial of our Mercury, when I was all alone. For when no Body was by me, nor probably dreamt of what I was doing, I took to one part of the Mercury, sometimes half the weight and sometimes an equal weight of refin'd Gold reduced to a Calx or subtle Powder. This I put into the palm of my left hand, and putting the Mercury upon it, stirr'd it and press'd it a little with the finger of my right hand, by which the two Ingredients were easily mingled, and grew not only sensibly but considerably hot, and that so nimbly, that the Incalescence did sometimes come to its height in about a minute of an hour by a spectas. Et sane aequum omnino fuerit, ut, cum mentionem duntaxat fecerim phaenomeni, cujus a multis negatur credibilitas, circumstantias nonnullas annotem, quae fidem ei conciliare valeant. Atque eo minus laborem detrectabo particularia aliquot phaenomena hic tradendi, tum quod ea Tibi non occurrisse autumem, tum quod ea grata fore putem quibusdam amicis tuis Chymicis, nobilem quendam vel jam posside~ vel paraturis Mercurium, ut scil. hoc qualicunque scripto nostro ad eum examinandum, &, an referat nostrum, experiundum, juventur. Itaque, ne mihi imponerent alii, pluries Mercurium nostrum, quando solus eram, explorabam. Etenim quando nemo mihi aderat, neque quisquam per somnium quid agerem conjiceret, sumebam unam partem illius Mercurii,, ad Auri, in calcem vel pollinem redacti, pondus quandoque dimidium, quandoque aequale. Hoc polline volae manus sinistrae immisso, & Mercurio superinfaso, utrumque simul agitabam, premebamque nonnihil digito manus dextrae; quaratione duo baec Ingredientia facile commixta, non modo ad sensum sed insigniter incalescebant, idque adeo propere, ut incalescentia interdum unius horae circiter minuto, indicante idipsum horologio minutis instructo, ad ~ perveniret. Succedebat hoc Experimentum, (523) a Minute-Clock. I found the Experiment succeed, whether I took altogether, or but half as much Gold as Mercury; but the effect seemed to be much greater when they were employed in equal weight. And to obviate a suspicion, which, though improbable, might possibly arise, as if the immediate contact of the Ingredients and the skin produc'd a sense of heat, which was not ~ the action of the Metals upon one another; I had the Curiosity to keep the mixture in a paper, and found not its interposition to hinder me from feeling the Incalescence, though it much abated the degree of my 9. I tried also the same Mercury with ~ Silver reduc'd to a very fine powder; but I could not perceive any heat or warmth at all; though I am apt to think, that if I had had a sufficient quantity of leaf-silver to have made the experiment with, I should after some time have produced an Incalescence, though much inferiour to what the same quantity of Mercury would produce with Gold; but this only upon the by. I shall now add, that to the end I might not be thought to impose upon my self, I did not only make trial in my own hand, when 'twas in different tempers as to heat and cold, but I did it in the hands of others, mentum, five aequalem sumerem five dimidiam Auri quantitatem; effectus tamen multo videbatur insignior, quando aequalipondere adhibebantur. Atque, ut suspicioni, quae, licet improbabilis, subnasci tamen posset, occurrerem, immediatum scil. Ingredientium & Cutis contactum producere posse sensum Caloris, qui non debeatur Metallorum in se invicem actioni, curiositate ducebar mixturam hanc in charta servandi; quo facto, interpositionem ejus nequaquaem impedire incalescentiae sensum comperiebam, quanquam, ex natura rei, intensiorem illius gradumremitteret. sense of it. Porro Mercurium eundem cum repurgato Argento, ad subtilem valde pulverem redacto, exploravi; at nullum omnino calorem percipere potui; quanquam eo ferar ut existimem si sufficiens Argenti foliati quantit as, ad per agendum Experimentum, mihi suppetiisset me post aliquod temporis spatium incalescentiam suscitaturum fuisse, quamvis multo inferiorem eo, quem eadem Mercurii quantitas cum Auro produceret: At hoc nonnisi in transiu. Adjiciam nunc, me, ne mibimet imposuisse censerer, non tantum rem hanc explorasse in manu mea, quando varie erat pro caloris & frigoris ratione temperata, sed & in manibus aliorum, quos non parum attonitos Y y y habebat, (524) thers, who were not a little surpris'd and pleased at the event. And this I did more than once or twice; by which means I had, and still have, divers Witnesses of the truth of the Experiment, whereof some are noted Persons, and especially him to whom I last shewed it, which you will easily believe when I tell you 'tis the Learned Secretary of the Royal Society; to whom having given the Ingredients, I desir'd him to make the Experiment in and with his own hands, in which it proved successful within somewhat less than a minute of an hour* *Since this was written, the Noble and Judicious President of the Royal Society, the Lord Viscount Brouncker, made the same Experiment with some of the same Mercury, in his own hand with good success. 10. And that which makes this Incalescence the more considerable is, that being willing to husband my Mercury, a great part of which had been, as I ghess'd, stolen from me before I employed it, I made these trials but with a drachm at a time, which scarce amounts in quantity to the bigness of half a middle siz'd Bean; whereas, if I could have made the Experiment with a spoonful or two of Quicksilver, and a due proportion of Gold, 'tis probable the heat would have been intense enough, not only to burn ones hand, habebat, juvabatque eventus. Atque hoc ipsum pluries quam semel bisve feci; unde mihi testes suppetunt Experimenti veritatis assertores, probatae fidei viri, quorum unus erat Eruditus Societatis Regiae Secretarius, quem, exhibitis ei Ingredientibus, rogabam, ut suis met manibus Experimentum caperet; in quibus & optatum successum minori quam anius minuti spatio sorticbatur ~. ~Ex quo tempore hoc liter is fuit consignatum, Illustrissimus & Judiciofissimus Regiae Societatis Praeces, Dom. Vicecomes Erouncker, idem Experimentum sua cum eiusdem Mercuuii portione, manu cum successu peregit. Atque, quod Incalescentiam hanc insigniorem reddit, est, quod, cum parce uti Mercurio meo cuperem, quippe cujus magna pars (ut conjicio) surrepta mihi fuerat, priusquam eum adhiberem, experimenta singula nonnisi cum nna drachma peragebam, quae vix fabae mediocris dimidiae magnitudinem aequat, cum, si copia mihi fuisset capiendi Experimentum cum cochleari uno alterove Mercurii pleno, supparique quantitate Auri, probabile sit, calorem inde oriturum fuisse satis intensum, ut non modo ureret manum, sed for san & in Phiala vitrea rimas (525) hand, but percnance to crack a glass Vial; since I have sometimes had of this Mercury so subtil, that when I employed but a drachm at a time, the heat made me willing to put it hastily out of my hand. 11. These things being matters of fact I scruple not to deliver them; but I would much scruple to determine thence, whether those that are Mercurii Corporum, and were made, as Chymists presume, by extraction only from Metals and Minerals, will each of them grow hot with Gold,as, if I much mistake nos, I found Antimonial Mercury to do. And much less would I affirm, that every Metall ne Mercury (though never so disposed to Incalescence) or even that of Silver or Gold it self, is the same with that which the Chrysopaean Writers mean by their Philosophick Mercury, or is near so noble as this.Nay,I would not so much as affirm, that every Mercury, obtained by extraction, even from the perfect Metals themselves, must needs be more noble and fit (as Alchymists speak) for the Philosophick work,than that which may with skill and pains be at length obtained from common Mercury skilfully freed from its recrementitious and heterogeneous parts, and richly impregnated with rimas ageret; quandoquidem interdum h ujus generis Mercurium habui adeo subtilem, ut, adhibente me singulis vicibus nonnisi drachmam unam, calor me adegerit ut propere e manibus mixturam deponerem. Haec,cum sint res facti, tradere non dubito; at valde ambigerem exinde determinare, num qui appellantur Mercurii Corporum, parantur que, ut jactant Chymici, sola extractione ex Metallis & Fossilibus, eorum quilibet calorem acquirat cum Auro, quemadmodum, ni multum fallor, Mercurium Antimonialem acquirere comperi. Multoqe minus affirmarem, quemvis Mercurium Metallicum (quantumcunque ad Incalescentiam dispositum,) quin & Mercurium Argenti Aurive ipsius eundem esse cum eo, quem Scriptores Chrysopaei per Mercurium suum Philosophicum intelligunt, vel praestantia sua ad hunc accedere. Quinimo, ne quidem assererem, quemlibet Mercurium, extractione etiam ab ipsis perfectis metallis impetratum, nobiliorem esse oportere, & (ut loquuntur Alchymistae) ad Philosophicam operatiorem magis idoneum, quam illum, qui, peritia & industria comite, obttneri tandem potest a Mercurio vulgari, a partibus suis recrementitiis heterogeneisq purgato, subtilibusque & efficacibus metallorum Mineraliumve conY y y 2 gruo(526) with the subtle and active ones of congruous Metals or Minerals. These and the like points I should, as I was saying, much scruple at offering to determine in this place, where what I design'd to deliver was Historical, though I have not thought it impertinent to glance at the points lately mention'd,because those glances may intimate things conducive to the better understanding of what I have said, and have to say in this Paper. 12. I doub not but what I have related and hinted has given you a Curiosity to know somewhat further of this Mercury: And I confess, that if there be any truth in what some of the most approved Spagyrists have deliver'd about a Solvent of Gold that seems of kin, and perhaps is not much Nobler than one that I had; it seems allowable to expect, that even ours should be of more than ordinary use, both in Physick and Alchymy. But the misfortune I had to have lost a considerable quantity of it, being afterward increased by the almost sudden death of the only Operator I trusted in the making of it; I was altogether discouraged from repeating such a troublesom Preparation, especially being diverted by Business, Removes, Sickness, and more pleasing gruorum partibus uberrime faeto? Haec, inquam, & similia hoc loco affirmare ~ vererer; cum hic nonnisi ea tradere instituerim quae ad rei Historiam faciunt; quanquam praeter rem non existimaverim, jamjam indigitatos rei hujus apices ianuere, quod stricturae istae ea possint Lectori ingerere, quae ad meliorem tuna dictorum tum dicendorum intelligentiam conducere queant. Non dubito, quin hactenus a me enarrata indigitataque Curiositatem in Te pepererint, aliquid amplius de hoc Mercurio cognoscendi: Et fateor, si quid veri subest ei, quod quidam ex probatissimis Spagyricis de quodam Auri dissolvente, quod affine videtur nostro, nec eo forte multo est nobilius, tradiderunt; exspectare fas fuerit, ipsissimum hoc nostrum in insignem cum in Medicina tum in Alchymia usum cedere posse. Verum cum infortunium illud, quo insigniori quantitate ejus fui privatus, stipatum fuerit subita morte Operatoris unici, cui in eo parando penitus sidebam, mentem plane alienam abiteranda tam molesta praeparatione sensi; maxime cum occupationes, mtgrationes, adversa valetudo studiaque gratiora aliorsum me traherent; Et licet Experimenta quaedam non spernenda, (527) sing Studies And though I have not forgot some not despicable Trials that I made with our Mercury, yet since they are not necessary to the Question that occasioned this Paper, I shall pass them over in silence, and only observe some few things I hod almost forgot to tell you; namely first, that whereas 'tis usual to take four,5 or 6,nay 8 or 10 parts of common Quicksilver to make an Amalgame with one of Gold, even when both are heated by the fire; I found our Mercury so congruous to that metal, that it would presently imbody with no less than an equal weight of it, and produce a pretty hard Amalgame or mixture, in which the Mercury was so diffused, that the Gold had quite lost its colour. Secondly, I shall add what for ought I know has not been yet observed, that this power of penetrating Gold and growing hot with it, is so inherent, not to say radicated, in our Mercury, that after it had been distilled from Gold again and again, I found it to retain that property. And lastly, whereas it may be suspected that this faculty may be quickly lost, (as that of the prepared Bononian Stone to receive Light, has been complain'd of as not durable) I found by trial that a single drachm da, cum Mercurio nostro peracta, memoria mea non exciderint; cum tamen ad Quaestionem illam, quae scriptum hoc peperit, non sint necessaria, silentio ea involvam,paucula duntaxat annotaturus, quae commemorare propemodum suissem oblitus. Quorum primum est, quod, cum solenne sit, capere Mercurii vulgaris partes quatuor, 5 vel 6,imo 8 vel 10, ad Amalgama faciendum cum una parte Auri, etiam tum quando utrumque incaluit igne; Fgo adeo congruum deprehenderim cum metallo illo Mercurium nostrum, ut non minus quam aequale illius pondus intime statim pervaderet, satisque durum Amalgama Cramave produceret, in quo adeo diffusus erat Mercurius, ut Aurum colorem suum penitus amitteret. Secundum est, (quod hactenus observatum fuisse haud putem,) vim scil. hance, Aurum penetrandi cumque co incalescendi, mordicus adeo inhaerere Mercurio nostro, ne dicam it a in eo radicatam esse, ut postquam iterum atque iterum ab Auro esset distillatus, proprietatis illius tenacem eum deprehenderim. Et denique, cum suspicio incessere Lectorem possit, facultatem hanc cito deperdi, (ut de praeparato ad hauriendam lucem Lapide Bononiensi queruntur Authores,) experiundo didici; unicam drachmam Mercurii, certo modo parati, post (528) drachm of Mercury, made after a certain manner, did the third or fourth year after I had laid it by grow so hot with Gold, that I feared't would have burnt my hand. Thus far the Author to his Friend: But when he sent me the Paper, he accompanied it with the following lines; 13. I have little at present to say to you about the Papers which this sheet accompanies, save that one of the chief Reasons that makes me backward to have the foregoing Observations communicated to the Curious, is, that I fear, we may thereby procure divers Queries and perhaps Requests, (relating to this Mercury) which I would by all means avoid, for divers Reasons, and particularly for this, that a great weakness of that part disables me to write with my own hand, and I know, you will not think it fit, I should about such a subject employ that of an Amanuensis. And therefore I cannot consent, this Paper should go out of your hands, unless you can think on some likely course to secure me from trouble, and from the unwelcom necessity of disobliging some, whilst I endeavour to gratifie others. If this praecaution be used, I may safely learn by means of your diffus'd Acpost tertium quartumve a quo seposueram annum adeo cum Auro incaluisse, ut ne adureret manum meam timerem. Hactenus Author noster ad Amicum suum: Sed tum mihi Chart as illas mitteret, voluit eas sequenti mantissa locupletare; Non diu te morabor disserendo de chartis hic junctis: Dicam solummodo, unam ex praecipuis rattonibas, quae in vulgandis praegressis Observationibus cunctabundum me faciunt, hanc esse, quod vereor,nos hoc ipso variu circa Mercurium hunc Quaestionibus & forte Sollicitationibus ansam daturos, quas omni studio praecavere velim, cum ob alias, tum hanc ob causam, quod magna manuum mearum debilitas me impedit, quo minus meamet manu id consignare literis valeam, quod conscribi Amanuensis opera consultum haud judicaveris. Proindeque concedere haud possum, scriptum hoc e manibus tuis dimitti, nisi rationem sugger as probabilem, qua securum me praestes a molestia, atque ab ingrata necessitate repulsam dandi nonnullis, dum aliis obsecundare studeo. Hac cautela si utaris, potero amplissimae tuae consuetudinis beneficio citra molestiam edoceri quid ii, qui tanta peritia tantoque judicio valent, ut in hoc (529) Acquaintance, what those that are skilful and Judicious enough to deserve to be much considered in such an affair, will think of our Mercury, and whether, in case they have an esteem of it approaching to that of divers eminent Chymists (some of which importune me to impart it;) they judge the good, that the preparations of it (such as precipitats and turbiths of divers kinds, Mercurius dulcis, Cinaber made of the sulphur of Antimony, and with Gold, &c.) may do in Physick, is likely much to exceed the political inconveniences that may ensue, if it should prove to be of the best kind, and fall into ill hands. The knowledge of the opinions of the wise and skilful about this case, will be requisite to assist me to take right measures in an affair of this nature. And till I receive this information, I am obliged to silence. 14. Only in the mean while, I shall for the sake of the Inquirers into Mercurial arcana make bold to add a Secret, which,I think, will to divers Philalethists and other students of the Chymical Philosopers books seem a Paradox, if not an untruth; namely, That a Mercury, qualified to heat with Gold, and perhaps with other Powders, may be made by more waies than one or two; exhoc negotio magni fieri mereantur, de Mercurio nostro sentiant; adhaec utrum, si aestimationem de co foveant illi supparem, quam praecellentium Chymicorum complures (quorum nonnulli me urgent ad cum communicandum) prae se ferunt, verisimile censeant, utilitatem, quam Praeparationes ipsius (cujusmoai sunt Praecipitata & Turbithi diversorum, generum, Mercurius dulcis, Cinnabaris ex antimonio & auro cum parata, &c.) afferre possint rei Medicae, longe superaturam esse incommoda illa politica, quae nascitura forent, si forte de praestantissima esset indote, atque in maleferiatas manus incideret. Sapientum & peritorum hoc in casu Opiniones cognoscere, necessarium mihi fuerit, ut recto tramite in istiusmodi negotio inceaere mihi detur. Atque, donec edoctus id fuero, silentii sacra colere teneor. Interim in eorum gratiam, qui Arcana Mercurialia scratantur, subjungere ausim secretum aliquod, quod Philalethis compluribus, aliisque, qui Chymicorum Philosophorum libris meditandis incumbunt, Paradoxum, quin & falsum forte videbitur: Mercurium soil. ad incalescendum cum Auro aliisve pulveribus idoneum, modis uno binove pluribus parari posse; cum ~ expe(530) experience having assured me (whatever Authorities or Theories may be urged to the contrary) that such a Mercury may be (I say not,easily or speedily, but successfully) prepar'd, not only by employing Antimony and solid Metals as Mars, but without any such Metal at all, or so much as Antimony it self. 15. Here I proposed to conclude: But because I am,as you know, very averse (which I declare my self to be on this occasion also) from making any promise to the publick, I think fit in this place to give you an Advertisement, and obviate a Scruple. I shall therefore admonish those Inquisitive Spagyrists, that may be desirous to try, whether their purified Mercury be Incalescent, that they be not too hasty to conclude it is not so; nor to reject it, unless they have made the trial with Gold duly prepared. For I have found, that my Mercury did not grow hot with the smallest filings of Gold I could make (though indeed within a few hours after it did, without the help of fire, imbody with it into a hard amalgama,) which argued that the corpuscles of the Metal were not yet small enough to be suddenly penetrated by the Quicksilver: Nor will experientiam ~ ~ ~, (quicquid in contrarium ~ dant Authoritates & ~) talem Mercurium posse, (non dicam facile propereve, sed cum successu) parari, non modo Antimonium solidaque Metalla, puta Martem, &c. adhibendo, sed citra ullius omnino Metalli, quin vel ipsius Antimonii, usum. Hic statueram finem huic sermoni imponere: At cum aegerrime, ut nosti, tum alias, tum hac imprimis occasione, promissi fidem publico obstringam, visum est mihi hoc loco Monitum aliquod suggerere, & Scrupulo cuidam obviam ire. Prius quod attinet, Curiosos illos Spagyricos, quos forte tentandi cupido incesserit, sitne purgatus ipsorum Mercurius incale scendi qualitate ~ctus, monebo, ne nimis festinanter concludant ipsum ea praeditum non esse, neve eum rejiciant, nisi Experimentum fecerint cum Auro rite praeparato. Comperi quippe, Mercurium meum non incalescere cum ramentis Auri, omnium quas conficere poteram minimis, (quanquam rever a intra paucas exinde horas, sine ignis adminiculo, cum ipso in durum amalgama conflaretur;) quod argumento erat, Metalli illius corpuscula necdum exigua satis fuisse, ut propere a Mercurio penetrarentur: Neque quaevis Auri calx (531) will every calx of Gold serve our turn,,as I have found by employing, without success, a very fine and spongy calx made after an uncommon way, the golden particles having, as it seem'd, some extremely fine though unobserved dust of the Additament sticking to them, which hindered the adhaesion of the Mercurial ones. Now, the calx of Gold that I most used, as finding it still to do well, was that made by Quartation ~ (as Alchymists call it.) ~ That is, by melting together one part of fine Gold, and 3 or 4 parts of cuppell'd Silver, and then putting the mass, wherein the Mettals are mixt, almost per minima, into purisied Aquafortis, which dissolving the Silver only, leaves the Gold in the form of a fine calx. But because'tis not so easie, as even Chymists that have not tried imagine, to make good calces of Gold, and that in the way newly mentioned there needs fusion of the Gold and of Silver (for which many Chymists want conveniences,) and they are often imposed on by common Refiners, who here usually sell in wires such Silver for fine (which indeed it is comparatively,) as I have found not to be without mixture; I shall ~ ~ by making an amalga~ ~ ~ way with pure ~ and ~ Mercury, and ~ ~ ~ in good Aquacalx rem nostram conficiet; ut comperi, dum perquam subtilem spongio samque calcem, modo non vulgari paratam, citra successum adhibui, in qua, ut videtur, apprime tenuis sensumque fugiens Additamenti pulvis adhaerebat particulis aureis, & Mercurialium adhaesionem praepediebat. Jam vero Calx auri,qua plerumque utebar, successu ejus inductus, illa erat quae Quartationis ~ (ut vocant) beneficio paratur. ~ Hoc est, per fusior em conslando unam partem Auri puri, & tres quati orve partes Argenti cupellati, ut vocant, & tunc immittendo massam, in qua Metalle miscentur quasi per minima, in purgatam Aquam fortem, quae solum Argentum dissolvens, Aurum in forma Calcis relinquit. At quia non adeo facile est, ut ipsi Chymici, qui manum operi non admoverunt, sibi imaginantur, bonae notae calces Auri parare, cumque in ~ jamjam memorata requiratur fusio Auri & Argenti (cujus peragendae commoditate non pauci Chymici destituuntur,) cum etiam crebro a vulgaribus Metallorum Purgatoribus fallantur, qui hic passim, filorum forma, ejusmodi Argentum pro puro venditant (quale, comparate loquendo, revera est,) quod non esse mixturae expers deprehendi; adjiciam, quod, dum communi more amalgama conficitur cum Auro Z z z puro (532) Aqua-fortis, there will remain a powder, which, being well washt with fair water to dulcifie it, and kept a while in a moderate fire to dry it throughly without melting it, will become a calx, which I have more than once used with our Mercury with good success. 'Tis true, both in this way and in that (by Quartation,) Aquafortis, which is a corrosive liquor, is employed to bring the Gold to powder, and therefore in a diffident mind some suspicion may arise, that the Incalescence may proceed only from the action of the acid particles of the menstruum, which yet adhering to the corpuscles of the Gold works upon the Quicksilver, as Aqua-fortis is known to do: But, to omit those answers that cannot be given in few words,after I have taken notice, that, if the effect depends not on our Mercury (as prepared) but only on the calx, it appears not, why this should not grow hot with common Mercury as well as with ours; I shall need to add, for the removal of this subtil scruple, no more, than this plain Experiment, (which I twice or thrice made,) namely, that taking, instead of a Calx of Gold, a competent number of Leaves of Gold, such as Book-binders and the puro & Mercurio vulgari, Mercuriusque dissolvitur bona Aqua forti, remansurus sit pulvis, qui cum aqua pura, ad conciliandam ei, quam vocant, dulcedinem probe elotus, & aliquandiu in temperato igne, ad cum penitus exiceandum citra fusionem, asservatus, talem Calcem praebebit, qua pluries cum Mercurio nostro feliciter usus fui. Fateor equidem, tum in hac methodo, tum in illa quae instituitur per Quartationem, adhiberi Aquam fortem, liquorem scil. corrosivum, ad Aurum in pulverem redigendum, unde sorutanti genio suboriri suspicio poterit, Incalescentiam illam soli actioni acidarum particularum Menstrui acceptam ferendam esse, quod haerens etiamnum Auri corpusculis, in Mercurium operetur, solenni Aquae fortis more. Verum, (ut eas responsiones sileam, quae paucis tradi non possunt,) postquam notavi, quod, si Effectus hic non dependet a Mercurio nostro (rite praeparato,) sed a sola Calce, non pateat, quare haec non incale scat aeque cum Mercurio vulgari ac nostro; opus haud fuerit, aliud quicquam ad sorupulum hunc eximendum, quam obvium hoc Experimentum, quod sequitur, quodque bis terve a me peractum fuit, adjicere: Sumpsi, inquam, Calcis Auri loco, sufficientem numerum Foliorum auri, qualibus utuntur Bibliopegi & (533) the Apothecary's use, this Gold, that was without the help of Salts reduc'd by beating to a sufficient thinness (insomuch that seventy odd Leaves did not weigh a scruple,) I found (more than once) upon putting two or three times the weight of our Mercury to them,that a smart heat was presently produced in my hand. & Aurifabri; hoc Aurum, quod citra salium opem tundendo redactum erat ad tenuitatem sufficientem (adeo ut ultra septuaginta folia vix unius scrupuli pondus aequarent,) hoc, inquam, Aurum comperi (una vice pluries,) cum binum trinumve Mercurii nostri pondus ipsi commiscerem, insignem in manu mea calorem mox peperisse.
