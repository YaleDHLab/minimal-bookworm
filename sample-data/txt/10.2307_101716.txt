Advertisement concerning the Quantity of a Degree of a Great Circle, in English measures. SOme while since an account was given * concerning the Quantity of a Degree of a great Circle, according to the tenour of a printed French Discourse, entituled De la Mesure de la Terre. The Publisher not then knowing what had been done of that nature here in England, but having been since directed to the perusal of a Book, composed and published by that known Mathematician Richard Norwood in the year 1636, entituled The Seaman's Practice, wherein,among other particulars, the compass of the Terraqueous Globe, and the Quantity of a Degree in English measures are deliver'd, approaching very near to that, which hath been lately observ'd in France; he thought, it would much conduce to mutual confirmation, in a summary Narrative to take publick notice here of the method used by the said English Mathematician,and of the result of the same; which, in short, is as follows: * See N. 112, and N. 124 of those Tract. A. 1635 the said Mr. Norwood, Reader of the Mathematicks in London, observ'd, as exactly as he could, the Summer-Solstitial Meridian Altitude of the Sun in the middle of the City of York, by an Arch of a Sextant of more than five foot radius, and found it to be 59 deg. 33~. And formerly (vid, A. 1633.) he had observ'd the like Altitude in the City of London near the Tower to be 62 deg. 1~. Whereupon he actually measured, for the most part,the way from York to London with Chains, and where he measur'd not, he paced it, (wherein, he saith, through custom he usually came very near the truth;) observing all the way he came, with a Circumferentor, all the principal Angles of position or windings of the way, with a competent allowance for other lesser Windings, Ascents and Descents; not laying these down by a Protractor after the usual manner, but framing a Table much exacter and fitter for this purpose; as may be seen in the English book it self. And by this Method and Measure he found the Parallel of York from that of London to be 9149 chains, every chain being six poles or ninety nine feet, 16 1/2 English feet to a Pole. Now, these 9149 Chains being equal to 2 deg. 28~. (the aforesaid Latitude between those two Cities) a little calculation makes it appear, that one Degree of a Great Circle, measured on the Earth, is 367196 of our feet,numero rotundo 367200, or 22254 Poles; which make 556 Furlongs and 14 Poles, (637) 14 Poles,or 69~ English miles and 14 Poles; 8 Furlongs to a mile, and 40 Poles to a Furlong. Which being compared to that measure of a Degree,which is deliver'd in the above-mention'd French Discourse, will be found to come very near it, they finding 73 miles fere, at 5000 feet to an English mile, which make 365000 feet; whereas the 69~ English miles and 14 Poles, found by Mr. Norwood, amount to 367200 feet, reckoning 5280 feet to an English mile, as the true measure of it is; whence the difference between these two measures appears to be no more than 2200 feet, which is not half an English mile by 440 feet. If any one desire to know further the whole Circumference, as also the Diameter and Semidiameter of the said Terraqueous Globe, according to this measure, he will easily find, The Circumference to be 25056 fere.
