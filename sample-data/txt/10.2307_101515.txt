Patternes Of the Tables proposed to be made for Observing of Tides, promised in the next foregoing Transactions; by Sr. Rob. Moray. IN performance of what was promised in the last of these Papers for Observing the Tides,here are subjoyned Patternes of the Tables there mentioned: One, for making the precise Time of the High-waters and Lowwaters during one Month; that is, between New and New Moon, or Full and Full Moon. The other, for marking the Degrees of the Risings and Fallings of the Water in Equalspaces of Time, and the Velocity of its motion at several heights: The Degrees of Heat and Cold, &c. The Times, assigned in the first, to the High-waters and Lowest Ebbs, are taken out of Mr. Wing's Almanack, for this present Year 1656, as he calculates them for the Month of September for London Bridge. Only, whereas he takes notice but of one High-water for every day, Here are set T down (312) down the Times of the other, and the two Ebbs intervening, by subdividing the Differences, he assignes between two Tides, equally amongst them. In all which, though there may be Errors, that is not to be considered, seeing the Dissein is to Correct and State the Times of the Tides exactly by Experiments, after this method. Mr. Wing states the High-waters to fall out at London-Bridge constantly, when the Moon is 46. deg. 30. min. to the West-ward of the Meridian. For, the Times, he marks for them, are made up by adding every day 3.hours, 6.minutes, to those in his Table for knowing the Time of the Moons coming to the South. The First Table consists of two parts, and each part of four Columns. The first part marks the Tides and Ebbs from the day of the New-Moon to its Full: The other, from the Full to the next New. The first Column in both parts hath the day of the Month and Week; M. standing every where for Morning, and A. for Afternoon. The third Column hath the Character of the day of the Week prefixt to the Hour and Minut of the High-water, and answering to the day of the Month. The last Column hath the same for the time of Low-water, varying the Character of the day, as often as the Low-water falls out more early than the High-water. In this Example between the said New Moons there falls out in all just 57. periods of the Tide or Flowing water, and 58. of the Ebb or Low-water; which numbers vary according to the Intervals of the Moons changes; but with what constancy and exactness, is to be inquired after: Which whosoever undertakes to do, may keep such a Talle, as is here proposed, in a Book by it self. The other Table doth in 9. Columns comprehend the Particular Observations of the Degrees of the Rising and falling of the Tides, and the other things specified at the Tops of them: The first Column marking the Hour and Minut common to all the several Observations. Each hour is divided in 3. equal parts, that number of Observation; being only pitch't upon by way of Example: The numbers may else be varied at pleasure, when other more frequent Observations are thought fit to be made, or when they prove too frequent and laborious; though the most frequent are most desirable, till competent Information of all particulars be attained. The Rising of the Tide from Low-water to the highest pitch of the Full Sea, is here supposed to be 60. foot: And the Degrees of its rising every 20. Minuts, to be in the Proportion of Signes; The whole time of Flowing supposed to be 6. hours. But this Example will serve for marking the Spaces of the Increasing or Rising,as well,as of the falling of the water,in order to the Investigation of their Proportions to one another: When the Duration of the Tide exceeds 6. hours by any number of minuts, as well as for just 6. hours; seeing they may easily be collected from any Number of Observations; their precise Time and that of the Duration of the waters Rising and Falling (that is, the just interval between the High-water and Low-water) being known: This Calculation by Signes being only set down as a Conjecture, flowing from Observations of the Motion of the water in its Rising and Falling, which (313) which seems to observe this or some such like Proportion; which is supposed still to hold in all Tides, be the Duration what it will; the Increate still continuing proportionably till the very midle of the Hight and Duration, and Decreasing afterwards in the same manner: Which whether it be so indeed ornot, is that, which is desired to be known. There is the like Proportion here supposed to be in the different degrees of the Velocity of the Current of the Water after Equal spaces of Times, as in its Rising and Falling: And so it is markt in the Third Column. But because the true Velecity of the Current of the Water, raised above the Levell 456/1000 of a foot, is unknown, it is by way of Supposition set at Ten feet in one Minute of an Hour, which being once stated, the rest distant from each other by the space of 20 Minutes of an Hour, are set down according to the same Proportion of Signes before suggested. It being supposed, that if the the Velocity of the Current of the Tide, after it hath flowed 20 minutes of an hour, be such, as a Log of Wood placed in the Water will move 10 foot in the space of one minute of time, at the middle of the Tide it will in the like space of Time move 114 f. 276/1000, and so proportionably at other times: Which, howsoever these Proportions shall be found by Experiments to fall out, may be not unworthy of the pains and charges requisite to acquire the knowledge of it. For, besides the satisfaction it may afford upon other accounts, it may possibly be of no small use to those, who need an exact reckoning of their Ships running, when the Velocity of the Current of the Tide may be necessary to be known; left through the defect of the knowledge of that, especially when it is reckoned less than indeed it is, the Ship be thrown in the night upon Shores, Rocks or Sands, when they reckon themselves to be far from them. The Numbers in the 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8. Columns are set down at random, only for Examples sake; there being no difficulty in the apprehension of it, and imitating of it in setting down the true Hights and Variations of the Thermometer, Baroscope, &c. the Use whereof is so vulgarly known, that there needs no further Direction concerning them. But if any person, who would make these Experiments, do not know the fabrick or use of any of the Instruments requisite for some of these Observations, nor where to have them, he may address himself to Mr. Shortgrave, one of the Operators of the Royall Society, lodged in Gresham Colledge, from whom he will receive full satisfaction about these things. But the labour employed in the Observations of the Heat, Cold, &c. required to be taken notice of in order to the Ends proposed in the former Tract, and others, that may be of no less delight than advantage, will be much retrenched, when Dr. Christopher Wren puts in practise, what he some years ago proposed to the Royal Society concerning an Engine with a Clockwork, which may perform these Observations in the last enumerate Columns, without being toucht or lookt after but once or twice a day. The Tables themselves follow. T 2 1666.
