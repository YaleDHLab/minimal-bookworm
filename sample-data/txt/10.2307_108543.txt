[ 253 ] XIV. Analytical Researches connected with STEINER'S Extension of MALFATTI'S Problem. By ARTHUR CAYLEY, M.A., Fellow of Trinity College, Cambridge. Com.municated by J. J. SYLVESTER, Esq., F.R.S. Received April 12,-Read May 27, 1852. THE problem, in a triangle to describe three circles each of them touching the two others and also two sides of the triangle, has been termed after the Italian geometer by whom it was proposed and solved, MALFATTI'S problem. The problem which I refer to as STEINER'S extension of MALFATTI'S problem is as follows:-"' To determine three sections of a surface of the second order, each of them touching the two others, and also two of three given sections of the surface of the second order," a problem proposed in STEINER'S memoir, 'Einige geometrische Betrachtungen,' Crelle, t. i, The geometrical construction of the problem in question is readily deduced from that given in the memoir just mentioned for a somewhat less general problem, viz. that in which the surface of the second order is replaced by a sphere; it is for the sake of the analytical developments to which the problem gives rise, that I propose to resume here the discussion of the problem. The following is an analysis of the present memoir:41. Contains a lemma which appears to me to constitute the foundation of the analytical theory of the sections of a surface of the second order. ? 2. Contains a statement of the geometrical construction of STEINER'S extension of MALFATTI'S problem. ? 3. Is a verification, founded on a particular choice of coordinates, of the construction in question. ? 4. In this section, referring the surface of the second order to absolutely general coordinates, and after an incidental solution of the problem to determine a section touching three given sections, I obtain the equations for the solution of STEINER'S extension of MALFATTI'S problem. 4 5. Contains a separate discussion of a system of equations, including as a particular case the equations obtained in the preceding section. 44 6 and 7. Contain the application of the formulae for the general system to the equations in ? 4, and the development and completion of the solution. ? 8. Is an extension of some preceding formulae to quadratic functions of any number of variables. 254 MR. A. CAYLEY'S ANALYTICAL RESEARCHES CONNECTED WITH ? 1.

In order to state in the most simple form the geometrical construction for the solution of STEINER'S extension of MALFATTI'S problem, let the given sections be called for conciseness the determninators *; any two of these sections lie in two dif. ferent cones, the vertices of which determine with the line of intersection of the planes of the determinators, two planes which may be termed bisectors; the six bisectors pass three and three through four straight lines; and it trill be convenient to use-the term bisectors to denote, not the entire system, but any three bisectors passing through the same line. Consider three sections, which may be termed tactors, each of them touching a determinator and two bisectors, and three other sections (which may be termed separators) each of them passing through the point of contact * I use the words ' determinators,' &c. to denote indifferently the sections or the planes of the sections; the context is always sufficient to prevent ambiguity. STEINER S EXTENSION OF MALFATI S PROBLEM. 255 of a deterrminator and tactor and touching the other two tactors; the separators will intersect in a line which passes through the point of intersection of the determinators. The three required sections, or as I shall term them the resultors, are determined by the conditions that each resultor touches two determinators and two separators, the possibility of the construction being implied as a theorem. The a posteriori verification may be obtained as follows ?3. Let x=(, y=O, z=O be the equations of the resultors, w=O the equation of the polar of the point of intersection of the resultors. Since the resultors touch two and two, the equation of the surface is easily seen to be of the form 2Yz+2;zx+2xy+w2-0*. The determinators are sections each of th em touching two resultors, but otherwise arbitrary; their equations are -ax+ +1 + = ox-13i +2x +w=0 2j-x+-2y-y +W=0. The separators are sections each of them touching two resultors at their point of contact (or what is the same thing, passing through the line of intersection of two resultors), and all of them having a line in common. Their equations may be taken to be y-b. 0, az-cx=0 bx-ay=O, the values of a, b, c remaining to be deternined. Now before fixing the values of these quantities we nmay find three sections each of them touching a determinator at a point of intersection with the section which corresponds to it of the sections cy-bz=0, az-cx=0, bx-ay=0, and touching the other two of the last-mentioned sections; and when a, b, c have their proper values the sections so found are the tactors. For, let Xv+py+vz+gw=0 be the equation of a section touching the determinator -ax+ y+-z+w=O, and the two sections bx-ay=0, az-cx=0, and suppose A2-X2+2+ -y-2yg 2?p 2', the conditions of contact with the sections bx-ay=0, az-cx=0 are found to be (b+a)A=(b+a)X-(b+a)p(b-a>) (c~a)A= (c+a)X-(c-a)fp-(c+a)P, values, however, which suppose a correspondence in the signs of the radicals. Thence * The reciprocal form is, it should be noted, x+Ly2+z -2yz-2z -2 y-2-w0. MflCCCcLU. 2 L 2i56 MR. A. CAYLEY'S ANALYTICAL RESEARCHES CONNECTED WITH (b+a)pj=(c+a)v; or since the ratios only of the quantities X, d, v, f are material, th=c+a, P=b+a, and therefore A2= 22(2a+b+c)2,+(bC)2-2e= (X-b-c)2 or 2= 2 (ax+bc). Whence the equation to a section touching bx-ay=0, az-cx=0 is Xx+(c+a)y+(b+a)z+V-2(aX+bc) lw=0. And to express that this touches the determinator in question, we have +?(X-b-c)= (4+a)-(z(2a+b+c)+2V-2(ax+bc); and selecting the upper sign, -X-2a&=-2 -2( ) whence ? =-24(a&-V-2hc), ./ -2(aX+bc) = (2am-V2bc); or the section touching the determinator and the sections bx-t-y=O, azcx=O is -2a(az-V-2bc) +(c+a)y+(b+a)z+(2am-V--2bc)w=0; and at the point of contact with the determinator 2.yz + 2zxY + 24xy + w= 0 2.yz+2 x+2 q+w20O. Eliminating w between the first and second equations and between the second and third equations, V-2bc( x+F?y++-z +cy+bz=O, (oax + y ) +2yz=-0; and from these equations (cy-bz)2=O, or the point of contact lies in the section c?-bz=0. It follows that the equations of the tactors are -2m(ao-<26c)x+ (c+a)y+ (b+a)z+(2ae-A2bc)w=0 (c-4b)x-213(b1 V-2ca)+ (a+b)z+(2b3-V-.-2ca)w=0 (b+c)x+(a+c)y-27(cyV-2ab)z+(2cy-V'-2ab)w=0, where a, b, c still remain to be determined. Now the separators pass through the point of intersection of the determinnators; the equations of these give for the point in question, : :Y: z : W=_ (2ry+ 1)(c&a4+ry+2c3y) : 320r2-. 1 ) -+ez -2+P2+r2; STEINER'S EXTENSION OF MALFATTI'S PROBLEM. 257 and the values of a, b, c are therefore a In c=(2f rb1)(-+I+r2fy) :(2rx+l1)(c-As+r+2c43) :(2 ap+ l ) (+ fge+ 2y) which are to be substituted for a, b, c in the equations of the separators and tactors respectively. Now proceeding to find the bisectors, let Xx+py+vz+gw=O be the equation of a section touching the determinators, x-,3W y+ Iz+w=O, 2y+2yY-yz+w=O. And suppose, as before, A2=x2+ 2 +2_ 2pv-20x2\p22, the conditions of contact are ?f3L~f3X(3+X>+p4+-2g +pr 7x+rx7 yy)-where it is necessary, for the present purpose, to give opposite signs to the radicals. For if the radicals had the same sign, it would follow that or the equation xx+py+yz+gw=O would pass through the point I 1 2 2 x:y:z : W=0; ' or the section would be a tangent section of the two determinators of the same class with the resultor =0, which ought not to be the case. The proper formula is ~[i~ (3+/>?I3v-+p-2] +1[ry+yr (r+DY-2] =0. And this equation being satisfied, the section Xx+PyYvz+gw=0 passes through a point 1 1 2 2 x: y: z: w=2:-2P -~72 --a The bisector passes through this point and the line of intersection of the determinators; its equation is 3(2x-PY?+ w) -x+ ,24z-+w/z ) =0; or reducing and completing the system, the equations of the bisectors are 2Y + 2 Z+ -(1 22 Z+( +20X) (2 p2-2) + ai W =0-~ 2-/ ~ ~ 2L 258 MR. A. CAYLEY'S ANALYTICAL RESEARCHES CONNECTED WITH And in order to verify the geometrical construction, it only remains to show that each bisector touches two tactors. Consider the bisector and tactor (1+ 2x+ (1+2-a.Y+(21 /(IjI 1I -2&(am,--V-2bc)x+ (c+a)y+ (b+a)z+ (2a-4V-2bc~w=n; and represent these for a moment by Xx+Py+vz+?w=O, X'+P'y+vz+ew=O.

The possibility and truth of the geometrical construction are thus demonstrated. 4.

The condition of contact becomes K 0,,+ K =O. And taking the under sign, x=V,/, so that if in the above written equation we establish all or any of the equations X=A-', V 5 / we have the equation of a section touching all or the corresponding sections of the sections x=0,y=0, z=0.

And it may be remarked in passing, that this is a very convenient form for the demonstration of the theorem; "If two sections of a surface of the second order touch each other, and are also tangent sections (of the same class) to two fixed sections, then considering the planes through the axis of the fixed sections and the poles of the tangent sections, and also the tangent planes through this axis, the anharmonic ratio of the four planes is independent of the position of the moveable tangent sections;" where by the axis of the fixed sections is to be understood the line joining their poles.

The preceding researches show that the solution of STEINER'S extension of MALFATTI'S problem depends on a system of equations, such as the system mentioned at the commencement of the following section.
