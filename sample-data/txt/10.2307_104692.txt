Mynde sc. A Letter from Mr. Joseph Platt to Mr. Peter Collinson F. R. S. concerning a flat Spheroidal Stone having Lines regularly crossing it. Dear Sir, Manchester, Dec. 9, 1749. A LITTLE while since a Man brought me a Stone, which he found at Ardwick, 7 Feet deep, near this Town, in driving a Slough through some Gret stone. It is what I call a Read Nov. 8. 1750. [535] a Nodule, of a close, compact, smooth Matter; was incrustated with coarser Earth, or soft Stone; is 3 Inches and a half Diameter; form'd not unlike one of the Echini marini; except the Papillae or small Protuberances, which it wants. Upon examining it, I find four white Seams, about the Bigness of a Horse-hair, which quarter the Stone very correctly. The Angles are exactly the same, and correspond so well, that it would require the nicest mathematical Head and Hand to draw the like. See TAB. I. Fig. 1. The Diameter A B is 3.7 Inches; the strait Line C D at the Bottom, or greater Base, is.42 of an Inch; that at the Top of the Stone is.21 of an Inch, which make the Angles C D equal at Top and Bottom, tho' of different Diameters. The Seams are like Talc or Spar. It weighs about 3 Pounds. I have several Nodules, but none like this. There is nothing curious in this Stone but the Lines, which I have described in the best manner I can. I am confident Chance had no Hand in forming it; and I am as certain, that no Artist was ever concerned or able to do the like; therefore I conclude it has been something form'd before the Flood, and is of marine Production. I am Your much obliged Friend, and humble Servant, Joseph Platt. The Stone having ~ cut in two, it was Pound that those regular Lines, composed of a sparry Matter, ponetrated the whole Substance of the Stone quite thro', and that they grew wider as they were nearer to the Centre. I have given a Representation of this Section at Fig. 2. TAB. I. C. M. IV.
