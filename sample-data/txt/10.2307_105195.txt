Of the thermometer, 68~.918. The greatest barometrical variation, during four years and four months, has been 9 tenths of an inch, viz. from 29.3 to 30.2. For altho' in April 1751. the mercury stood at 29.1, I find, by a note in my diary, that some air having insinuated itself into the tube, I judg'd the mercury to stand 3 tenths of an inch lower than it ought. The greatest thermometrical variation, during the said time, has been 20~; viz. from 60~ to 80~: But it may be observ d, I never knew it rise to high but once; occasion'd by a very strong leste or levant wind; the extreme height, without such an accident, being never more than 78~. N. B. It may be necessary to advise, that my observations are made in the city of Funchal. The [619] The quantity of rain, which has fallen in the island of Madeira. Anno 1751. 1752. 1753. Inch.
