May it Please Your most Excellent Majesty, N O W it hath pleased GOD to establish Your Majesty's Health, I most humbly present to Your Majesty, instead of Medicinal Preseriptions, some Papers which have been lately laid before the Royal Society, instituted by Your Royal Uncle King Charles II. for Promoting Arts DEDICATION. Arts and Sciences, the greater Glory of GOD, and the Good of Mankind, as it is express'd in the Words of his Charter of Incorporation. The Accounts here publish'd are such as conduce to those Ends, and lead Us to the Admiration of the Works of the Great Creator: And therefore I hope Your Majesty's Exemplary Piety and Goodness, sufficiently known to all, but more especially to those who have the Honour to serve You, will Pardon my Presumption; Custom having made such Addresses in almost all Ages a Testimony of Duty. The Royal Society is very sensible of Your Majesty's great Grace and Favour to their Body, in thinking of them amidst Your very many and weighty Affairs; and giving them the Direction of Your Royal Observatory at Greenwich, set up by their Patron and Founder, for Promoting the Ends of their Institution, more particularly Astronomy and Navigation, for the Benefit of this Trading Kingdom. This DEDICATION. This Trust in a particular manner requires most humble Thanks; and so do other great, tho' too little regarded Blessings, which we partake with all Your Subjects; and which, next to Almighty GOD, we owe to Your Majesty's great Care, Protection, and Wisdom: I mean, that we have lived in a manner easily and quietly, when almost all our Neighbours have been under the great Calamities of War and its Consequences, Plague, Pestilence, and Femine, in the Bowels of their Countries. The best Return for so many Benefits that can be made, and I dare presume the most pleasing to Your Majesty, would be, that all of Us, in our several Capacities, should shew Ourselves Thankful and Dutiful to GOD, live in peaceable Submission to the Laws of our Country, of which Your Majesty under GOD is the great Guardian, and be ready to do all good Offices which Civil Society requires of one to another. I do DEDICATION. I do assure YOUR M A J E S T Y I will endeavour thus to gain Your Majesty's Favour; and remain with unfeigned and profound Respect, Your Majesty's most Obedient, and Most Dutiful Subject And Servant, July 26, 1712.
