C 332 2 XV. Observations of the changeable Brightness of the Satellites of Jupiter, and of the Variation in their apparentMagnitudes; with a Determination of the Time of their rotatory Motions on their Axes. To which is added, a Measure of the Diameter of the Second Satellite, and an Estimate of the comparative Size of all the Four. By William Herschel, LL.D. F. R. S. Read June i, 1797. IT may be easily supposed when I made observations on the brightness of the 5th satellite of Saturn, by way of determining its rotation upon its axis, and found that these observations proved successful, that I should also turn my thoughts to the rest of the satellites, not only of Saturn, but likewise of Jupiter, and of the Georgian planet. Accordingly I have from time to time, when other pursuits would permit, attended to every circumstance that could forward the discovery of the rotation of the secondary planets; especially as there did not seem to lie much difficulty in the way. For since I have determined, by observation, that the 5th satellite of Saturn is in its rotation subject to the same law that our moon obeys, it seems to be natural to conclude that all the secondary planets, or satellites, may probably stand in the same predicament with the two I have mentioned; consequently a few observations that coincide with this proposed theory, will go a good way towards a confirmation of it. I had another point in view when I made the observations Dr. HERSCHEL'S Observations, &c. 333 which are contained in this paper. It was an attempt to avail myself of the abundant light and high powers of my various telescopes, to examine the nature and construction of the bodies of the satellites themselves, and of their real magnitudes. Here phaenomena occurred that will perhaps be thought to be remarkable, and even inconsistent or contradictory. So far from attempting to lessen the force of such animadversions, I shall be the first to point out difficulties, in order that future observations may be made to resolve them. Perhaps it would have been better to delay the communiication of these observations, till I had continued them long enough to be able to account for things which at present must be left doubtful. But as in final conclusions to be drawn from astronomical observations, we ought to take care not to be precipitate; so on the other hand I am perhaps too scrupulous in satisfying myself, and should probably require the observations of several years before I could venture to be decisive. It will also be seen by the dates of the first observations, that a further delay in the communication cannot be adviseable; since much information may possibly be gained by throwing open, to other observers, the road it will be eligible to take for a satisfactory investigation of the subject; especially as we have reason to congratulate ourselves on the spirit of observation, and increase of large instruments, that seem to have taken place in various parts of Europe. I shall now transcribe the observations from my journals. They are as follows. Xx 2 334, Dr. -HERSCHEL'S Observations of the OBSERVATIONS. A remarkable Conjunction of two Satellites of 7upiter.

The 4th satellite of Jupiter is large and bright. The 3d satellite is large and bright. The 1st satellite is pretty small, and not very bright. The 2d satellite is small, and considerably bright. The brightness and magnitude of each satellite refer to its own usual brightness and magnitude. Before we can proceed to draw any conclusions from these observations, we ought to take notice of many causes of deception, and of various difficulties that attend the investigation of the brightness of the satellites. The difference in the state of the atmosphere between two nights of observation, cannot influence much our estimation of the brightness of a satellite, provided we adopt the method of comparative estimations. If we endeavour by much practice to fix in our mind a general ideal standard of the brightness of each satellite, we shall find the state of the atmosphere in different nights very much disposed to deceive us; but if we learn to acquire a readiness of judging of the comparative brightness of each satellite with respect to the other three, we may arrive at much more precision, since the different disposition of the air will nearly affect all the satellites alike. But here, as we get rid of one cause of deception, we fall under the penalty of another. The situation of those very satellites to which we are Brightness of the Satellites of Yupiter. to refer the light of the satellite under estimation, being changeable, permits us no -longer to trust to their standard, without a full scrutiny of the causes that may have producedan alteration in them. In the foregoing observations it will also be seen, that I attempted to compare the intenseness of the light of the satellites with the different brightness of the disc of Jupiter; but these endeavours will always fail, on account of the little assurance we can have that the parts of the disc, setting aside its quick rotation, will remain for any time of the same lustre. A very material difficulty arises fromn the magnifying power we use in our estimations. If it be a low one, such as for instance iSo (for a lower should not even be attempted), then we run the risk of being disappointed, in bright nights by the sparkling of the brilliant light of the satellites. Besides, we cannot then see the bodies of them, and judge of their comparative magnitude, with the same power that we view their light. If we choose a high magnifier, we shall be often disappointed in the state of the atmosphere, which will of course occasion an interruption in the series of our observation, of which the regular continuance is of the greatest consequence. If we change our power according to the state of the atmosphere, we introduce a far worse cause of confusion; for it will be next to impossible to acquire, for each magnifying power, an ideal standard, of comparative brightness to which we can trust with confidence. If the magnitudes are not attended to, and carefully contradistinguished from the intenseness of light, we shall run into considerable error, by saying that a satellite is large, when we mean to express that it is bright. It is so common to call stars that are less bright than others, small, that we must be careful 344 Dr. HERSCHEL'S Observations of the to avoid such ambiguities, when the condition of the satellites is under investigation. Nor is it possible to throw the size and light into one general idea, and take the first coup d'oeil in looking at them, to decide about the general impression this compound may make. When our attention is forcibly drawn by a considerable power to the apparent size of the satellite we are looking at, its brightness can no longer be taken in that general way, but must be abstracted from size. Let us now see what use may be drawer from the observations I have given. It appears in the first place very obviously, that considerable changes take place in the brightness of the satellites. This is no more than might be expected. A variegated globe, whether terraqueous like the earth, or containing regions of soil of an unequal tint, like that side of the moon which is under our inspection, cannot, in its rotation, present us with always the same quantity of light reflected from its surface. In the next place, the same observations point out what we could hardly expect to have met with; namely, a considerable change in the apparent magnitude of the satellites. Each of them having been at different times the standard to which another was referred, we cannot refuse to admit a change so well established, singular as it may appear. The first of these inferences proves that the satellites have a rotatory motion upon their axes, of the same duration with their periodical revolutions about the primary planet. The second either shews that the bodies' of the satellites, are not spherical, but of such forms as they have assumed by their quick periodical and slow contemporary, rotatory motions, and which forms in future may become a subject for mathematical Brightness of thje Satellites of ?upiter. 345 investigation; or it may denote, in case geometrical researches should not countenance a sufficient deviation from the spherical form, that some part of the discs of these satellites reflects hardly any light, and therefore in certain situations of the satellite makes it appear of a smaller magnitude than in others. 1ere then we see evidently that a considerable field for speculation, as well as observation, is opened to our view; and almost every attempt to enter upon the work must seem premature, for want of more extended observations. However, from those that have been given, such as they are, I will shew how far we may be authorized to say, that the satellites revolve on their axes in the same time that they perform a periodical revolution about the planet. I shall take the usual method of throwing the observations of each satellite into a graduated circle. The zero of the degrees into which I suppose it divided, is in all observations assumed to be in the place of the geocentric opposition. In order to bring these observations to the circle, the places of the satellites have been calculated from my own tables of the mean motion in degrees, and according to epochs continually assumed from the geocentric conjunctions pointed out in the configurations of the Nautical Almanac; and the nearest of these conjunctions have been always used. This method is fully sufficient for the purpose, as greater precision in the calculation is not required. The observations extend from July 19, 1794, to November 3, 1796; and therefore include a period which takes in 470 rotations of the ist satellite; 234 of the 2d; 1 i6 of the 3d; and so of the 4th : that is, provided we admit that these rotations 34j6 Dr. HERSCHEL'S Observations of the are performed in the same time the satellites revolve in their orbits. In the following table are the calculated places of the satellites; the correct sidereal times, given with the observations, having been turned into mean time.

VIII. and IX. By way of uniformity I judged it would be best to reduce the estimations of magnitude to those of brightness; as it may be justly supposed that when a satellite is at any given time larger in proportion to another than it was at another time, it will also be brighter than it was at that other time, due regard being had to the light of the satellite to which its magniBrightness of the Satellites of Jupiter. 3447 tude has been compared. To manage the space allotted to the figure advantageously, I have used the abbreviations formerly employed in my catalogue of Nebulae, v B, c B, B, p B, p F, F, c F, v F, for all the gradations of light that are necessary to express the brightness of the satellites at the time of obe servation. It will be easily remembered that B and F mean bright and faint; and p, c, v, stand for pretty, considerably, and very. Now, when the observation mentions the brightness of the satellite, I place it in the figure as it is given. In that of the first, for instance, July 19, 1794, we find the satellite called very bright; I therefore put down in fig. 1. (Tab.VIII.) at 127 degrees, v B. But where the brightnessis not expressed, I have recourse to the comparative magnitude, if that can be had. By fig. i. (Tab. IX.) it appears that the 2d satellite is less subject to a change of brightness than either the ist or 4th: it becomes, for that reason, a pretty good standard for the light of these other satellites. Therefore, in the observation of October 2, 1795, for instance, where the 1 st satellite is described as undoubtedly less than the 2d, I put down very faint, or v F, at 34p degrees of the circle in fig. i.; for in the observation of July 19, before mentioned, when the satellite was called very bright, it was at the same time described as undoubtedly larger than the 2d. In this case, as regard must be had to the relative state of the satellite we refer to, the four figures I have given will assist us in determining the condition of the light of the satellite we wish to admit as a standard. In reducing the 2d satellite to the circle, I have generally used a reference to the magnitude of the ist, where marks of '.eDCXCV1L Z z Dr. HERSCHEL'S Observations of the brightness were wanting; and sometimes also to the magnitude of the 4th, and even of the 3d. The 3d satellite can hardly be ever compared to any but the 2d in magnitudeand this only in its degree of excess. The magnitude of the 4Wth satellite has been generally compared with that of the 1st: and also sometimes with that of the 2d. To make an application of the contents of the figures, will now require little more than a bare inspection of thenm. The ist satellite appears evidently to have a rotation upon its axis that agrees with its revolution in its orbit. It cannot be supposed that, in the course -of 47o revolutions, all the bright observations could have ranged themselves in one half of the orbit, while the faint ones were withdrawn to the other. The satellite appears in the middle of the duration of its brightness, when it is nearly half way betwveen its greatest eastern elongation, in the nearest part of its orbit; or when advancing towards its conjunction. I have pointed out this circumstance by a division with dotted lines, and the words bright and faint, inserted within the circle, fig. i. This satellite, therefore, revolves on its axis in 1d 18h 26',6. The 2d satellite, though much less subject to change, on account as we may suppose, of having only a small region on its body which reflects less light than the rest; has, nevertheless, its rotation directed by the same law with the ist. It will hardly be necessary to take notice of a single deviation which occurs at 163 degrees, fig. 2.; as from the proximity of the satellite to the conjunction, a mistake in the estimation may easily take place. I generally made it a rule ;not to mnake Brightness of the Satellites of Jupiter. allowance for the influence of the superior light of the planet; but it seems that we can hardly abstract sufficiently on such occasions. Two similar cases occur, in fig. 3. at 179; and fig. 4. at 5 degrees. It is indeed not impossible but that occasional changes, on the bodies of the satellites themselves, may occasion some temporary irregularity of their apparent brightness: it will,, however, not be necessary to make such an hypothesis, till we-have better authority for it. The brightest side of this satellite is turned towards us when it is between the greatest eastern elongation and the conjunction. It revolves, consequently, on its axis in 3d 18h 17',9. The 3d satellite suffers but little diminution of its brightness, and is in full lustre at the time of both its elongations. It is however not impossible but that, after having recovered its light, on the return from the opposition, it may suffer a second defalcation of it in the nearest quadrant about half way towards the conjunction. The two independent observations at ii and 152 degrees, fig. 3. seem to give some support to this surmise. It revolves on its axis in 7d 3}1 59',6. The 4th satellite presents us with a few bright views when it is going to its opposition, and on its return towards the greatest eastern elongation; but otherwise -it is generally overcast. Its colour also is considerably different from that of the other three; and it revolves on its axis in 16d 18h ' 1. It will not be amiss to gather into one view, all the obser-v vations that relate to the colour of the satellites. The ist is white; but sometimes more intensely so than at others. The 2d is white, bluish, and ash-coloured. ZZ 2 350 Dr. HERSCHEL'S Observations of the The gd is always white ; but the colour is of different intensity, in different situations. The 4th is dusky, dingy, inclining to orange, reddish and ruddy at different times; and these tints may induce us to surmise that this satellite has a considerable atmosphere. I shall conclude this paper with a result of the observation of the diameter of the second satellite, taken by its entrance upon the disc of the planet, July 28, 1794, and marked in fig. 2. at 176 degrees. The duration by the observation is fixed at 4 minutes; in which time it passes over an arch in its orbit of i6' 52",9. Now as its distance from the planet is to its distance from the earth, so is 16' 52",9 to the diameter of the satellites; or the mean distance of the 2d satellite may be rated, with M. DE LA LANDE, at 2' 57", or 177". Then putting this equal to radius, we shall have the following analogy. Radius is to 177", as the tangent of i6'52",9 is to the angle, in seconds, which the diameter of the second satellite subtends when seen from the earth. And by calculation, this comes out o",87; that is less than nine-tenths of a second. I have not been scrupulously accurate in this calculation, as the real distance of Jupiter at the time of observation should have been computed, whereas I have contented myself with the mean distance. Nor am I very confident that the angle of the greatest elongation, admitted to be 2' 57", is quite accurate; but I judged it unnecessary to be more particular, because the time of my observation in the beginning of the transit upon the disc, I find was only taken down in whole minutes of the clock. The end, however, is more accurately determined, by the observation which was made 4-5" after the immersion; when a Brightness of hte Satellites of Yupiter. part of the disc, equal to about 4 of the diameter of the satellite, is said to be visible. It seems that observations of this kind, made with very good telescopes, charged with high powers, are capable of great precision. For the remark that a margin of Jupiter, equal to about 4 of the diameter of the satellite, became visible in 45" of time, adds great support to the accuracy of the observation of the foregoing 4 minutes: and, at all events, it is evidently proved, from the whole of the entrance upon the disc, that the diameter of this satellite is less, by one half at least, than what from the result of the measures. of former observers it has been supposed to be. A method has also been used, of deducing the diameter of the satellites from the time they employ to immerge into the shadow -of the planet; but this must be very fallacious, and ought not to be used. I should not pass unnoticed the apparent magnitude of the satellites. The expressions that have been given of them may be collected into the following narrow compass. 1 ,4,2 41 3-,4; 12 4, 2,1 3--4; 1;2 1,4,2 3-2,1,4 3--!2-I ,4 1 2 4.1-2 1 2-4 3-1, 2 2 -l1 From which we may conclude, that the 3d satellite is considerably larger than any of the rest; that the ist is a little larger than the 2d, and nearly of the size of the 4th; and that the 2d is a little smaller tha-ni the ist and 4th, or the smallest of them all.
